            "title": "The \"selfie\" evolution, from paint brush to cellphone click",
            "text": "\tTHE HAGUE, Netherlands - Anyone with a smartphone can take a selfie in a second.\n\nFour hundred years ago, people also wanted pictures of themselves. They took much longer to make, though. These pictures were called self-portraits. They were painted by expert artists who thought long and hard about each detail.\n\nNow the Mauritshuis museum is putting on an exhibit of these self-portraits. The museum is in the Netherlands, a country in Europe.\n\nPeople in the Netherlands are known as the Dutch. The paintings were painted during what is called the Dutch Golden Age. The Netherlands became very rich in the 1600s. Science and the arts flourished during this time. Many beautiful paintings were created.\n\n## Modern Selfies Meet Old Self-Portraits\n\nThe exhibit at the Mauritshuis wants to show how selfies and self-portraits are alike. It also shows how different they are.\n\nEmilie Gordenker is the museum's director. She said that this is the first time a museum has shown Dutch Golden Age self-portraits next to modern selfies. The Mauritshuis was eager to connect the old paintings to the selfie craze.\n\nThe exhibition started October 8 and ends January 3. It includes 27 self-portraits. They are by artists such as Rembrandt van Rijn, to a painter named Judith Leyster. Rembrandt is one of the most famous artists in history.\n\nPainter Huygh Pietersz Voskuyl is not as well known as Rembrandt. His self-portrait is on the poster for the exhibition. He painted it in 1638. He is staring over his right shoulder at something out of the frame. It almost looks like a selfie, and you can picture him looking into the tiny lens on a cellphone. Golden Age artists used mirrors to see to paint themselves. In the exhibit, giant mirrors are all over. They reflect the paintings.\n\n## Selfie-Encouragement\n\nThere are similarities between selfies and self-portraits. The painter painted himself or herself. Yet, there are also big differences. A selfie is often taken quickly, and people might not pay attention to how they are posed. The paintings are carefully planned works of art.\n\nA video was made for the exhibit. It shows how the artists paid attention to every detail. It also shows what today's selfie makers can learn from them to improve their pictures.\n\nYes, you are allowed to take selfies in the museum.\n\n## \"All These Little Details\"\n\nThe painting by Voskuyl looks very simple. Yet it is a good example of how the painters paid attention to all the details.\n\n\"He brings out all these little details, like his beard or the little embroidery on his shirt,\" Gordenker said. He even painted the fake wooden wall behind him. He thought very hard about the things that make him who he is. \"At the same time, you can see the skill with which he painted this,\" Gordenker said.\n\nThe painting also had another purpose. It was a good advertisement for what he could do. It showed off the artist and his talent to people who wanted to buy his paintings.\n\n## It's About Creating\n\nFor many artists, self-portraits were not just a picture of the artist, said Ariana van Suchtelen. She organized the exhibit. Self-portraits were also an example of the beautiful paintings the artist could create.\n\nRembrandt, for instance, was very famous for his sketchy way of painting. A self-portrait by Rembrandt showed buyers his skills. It showed off \"what he could do, what he was famous for.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES -In the 1960s, '70s and '80s, many young people learned to play the accordion. Salesmen sold accordions door-to-door. Dozens of schools taught the instrument.\n\nBack then, accordion students from all over the country came to LA for a yearly contest.\n\nOne boy's life was changed when a salesman knocked on his door almost 50 years ago.\n\nAlfred Matthew Yankovic was only 7 years old when his parents bought him an accordion and lessons.\n\nLater, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic used an accordion to record his first song. It was the beginning of a successful career that has lasted more than 30 years. It even earned him three Grammy Awards.\n\nStill, Yankovic knew his instrument was not \"cool.\"\n\n## From Unhip To Cool\n\n\"The accordion got a reputation of being kind of unhip,\" Yankovic said with a laugh.\n\nBut now things are changing. The accordion has a new reputation: it's becoming cool.\n\nPeople noticed when popular bands such as Mumford &amp; Sons and Gogol Bordello started using accordions.\n\nThe 2001 French film \"Amelie\" also helped bring the accordion back. The movie's soundtrack features the instrument.\n\nIt also helps that young people nowadays are looking for \"weird\" things to make cool again.\n\nYankovic said he noticed the accordion getting more popular about 10 years ago. He joked that he probably had something to do with it.\n\nBut for some people, the accordion was always cool.\n\nLatino musicians like Faco Jimenez and Ramon Ayala are masters of the button accordion. In this world, the accordion was never a joke. It has always been respected as a serious instrument.\n\n## \"A Very Simple Music\"\n\nButton accordionist Oto\\xc3\\xb1o Luj\\xc3\\xa1n never thought of the instrument as weird or embarrassing.\n\nIn Latino culture, it does not have the same reputation of being nerdy, said Luj\\xc3\\xa1n, who teaches accordion.\n\n\"It's a very simple music,\" he said. \"But it's got a soul to it that really pulled me in.\"\n\nAlthough he's trained on the button style, Luj\\xc3\\xa1n loves all accordions. \"There's all these different flavors,\" he said.\n\nOn a street in Los Angeles, a small red and white neon sign reads: \"DAVE'S ACCORDION SCHOOL.\"\n\nInside, black and tan cases cover the floor.  Two shelves hold accordions and other instruments for sale.\n\nPictures of Weird Al Yankovic and Irish band the Pogues hang on the wall.\n\nOwner Dave Caballero, 68, sat on a piano bench examining the inside of a brown accordion.\n\nDown the hall, his wife, Veronika, was finishing a lesson with 92-year-old Emily Gaughenbaugh.\n\n## Playing A French Song\n\nGaughenbaugh said she took up the instrument a couple of months ago, partly because it's better than doing crossword puzzles.\n\nShe waited for her 66-year-old daughter to finish her guitar lesson in another room. She listened as  a man with gray hair played a French song on an accordion.\n\nSoon a young women with a short haircut and a young Russian boy showed up for their lessons.\n\n\"Accordion is coming back,\" Gaughenbaugh said, smiling. \"For a while it was kind of a joke.\"\n\nCaballero opened his shop in 1971. He always thought of the accordion as cool. Many of his students say they were inspired by their favorite musicians or by the movie \"Amelie\".\n\nSome students like the accordion because it is easy to carry around. Others are fascinated by it, but they aren't sure why.\n\n\"I think it's just the general curiosity,\" he said. \"People just love the tone of the accordion.\"\n\nEven with three helpers, it is difficult for Dave to repair all the accordions people send him. Some come from as far away as Tahiti and Hawaii.\n\n\"We can never catch up,\" Caballero said. His shop is full of accordions all the time.'"

            "text": "\tBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Less than a year ago, Shah Bibi Tarakhail was at home in Afghanistan. She went outside one morning to play with her brother. There had been a dangerous battle the night before. But that was nothing the people in her village weren't used to. Their village had been a center of violence since the Afghan war began.\n\nShe picked up something that looked like a rock. But it was actually a grenade. Shah Bibi threw it on the ground and it exploded.\n\nThe explosion killed Shah Bibi's brother. It took off most of her right arm, destroyed her eye and scarred her face.\n\nA group called Children of War Foundation wanted to help her. It brought her to the United States. Shriners Hospital treated Shah Bibi for free.\n\nWhen the doctors and therapists met the little girl, they knew that giving her a new arm would change her life.\n\nBut they could never have guessed what happened next. Within weeks of strapping on her new limb, she would be using it to pick up a brush. With it, the 7-year-old began carving out a new life. A life as a painter.\n\n## \"That One!\"\n\n\"What color would you like?\" asked artist Davyd Whaley. They were seated at a table in an art gallery in Beverly Hills.\n\n\"That one!\" the normally quiet girl responded. She pointed to a tube of blue paint. Then, before her teacher could fetch it, she grabbed it with her new hand. She unscrewed the top with her other hand. She began squeezing out the tube onto a palette.\n\nHer friends from the childrens' hospital watched her. They were delighted. Shah Bibi made a series of wide brush strokes. She used a piece of art board Whaley had provided. Soon there were shades of blue, green and bright orange. They were laid out across little stickers of fish, bunnies, a flower and sky. Whaley had showed her how to place them on the board beforehand.\n\nAt one point she giggled. She was embarrassed. She had accidentally squeezed a tube of orange paint onto the painting. It was supposed to go on the palette. But Whaley told her that accidental art sometimes makes the best abstract art.\n\nThe finished result \"was pretty mind-blowing,\" the grown-up artist said afterward.\n\n## \"Yes!\"\n\nShah Bibi not only handles a brush well, Whaley said. She has an strong grasp of matching colors.\n\nWhaley said she has such talent, she could grow up to be an artist. His own work is hanging at the Beverly Hills gallery.\n\nShe'll return to her family in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) next week. But Children of War plans to bring her back next year. They want to give her a new eye and take care of her scars.\n\nShe's learned to speak a lot of English since she came to the U.S. And she also has a taste for American culture. She was wearing a pretty dress and a pair of Minnie Mouse shoes. Sometimes she sang along to the song \"Let It Go\" from the Disney movie \"Frozen\" as she painted.\n\nAfterward she was a bit quiet but still all smiles. She wandered the gallery with an iPhone, snapping pictures of the paintings, the sculptures and the people.\n\nBut there was still some unfinished business.\n\nWhaley asked if she might like to do another painting.\n\n\"Yes!\" came the happy reply. And the two of them got back to work.'"

He died early Thursday in London. \n\n## A Bad Guy Who Was Fun To Watch\n\nIn the \"Potter\" movies, Daniel Radcliffe played the part of teenage wizard Harry Potter. Radcliffe said Rickman was \"undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with.\" The two actors appeared together in eight \"Harry Potter\" movies. \n\nRickman was born in London in 1946. He learned to act at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. \n\nIn his movies Rickman often played evil, wicked people. Audiences had fun watching him act nasty.\n\nRickman appeared in many movies. He had big parts in 1988's \"Die Hard\" with Bruce Willis, 1990's \"Truly Madly Deeply\" and 2003's \"Love Actually.\"\n\n## Professor Snape Of Hogwarts\n\nHowever, Rickman was probably best known for playing Snape in the \"Potter\" movies. Snape is a professor of magic at the Hogwarts school. It is never quite clear whether he is an enemy or a friend of young Harry Potter. He may even be both.\n\nRadcliffe was very young when he began working on the \"Potter\" movies. Rickman was one of the first to treat him like a grownup, he said. Radcliffe said he learned a great deal from the older actor. \"I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nHarry Potter creator J.K. Rowling said she was shocked to hear of Rickman's death. He was a great actor and a \"wonderful man,\" she said.\n\n## \"Gloriously Nasty\" In Robin Hood\n\nRickman also played the part of the Sheriff of Nottingham in the 1991 movie \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\" In that picture, he was Robin Hood's great and evil enemy. The movie is set in the Middle Ages.\n\nMohammed Saghir is the real-life Sheriff of Nottingham today. Saghir praised the way Rickman played the part.\n\n\"His sheriff was a gloriously nasty character,\" Saghir said. It was \"easy to love to hate\" him. Rickman \"appeared to have great fun playing\" the part, Saghir added.\n\n## Nice In Real Life\n\nRickman did not only play evil characters, however. He also played heroes, and sometimes funny characters. He acted in plays as well as in movies.\n\nRickman was a very nice person in real life. However, sometimes he kept playing his part even when he was not on camera. During the filming of \"Harry Potter,\" he kept on acting like Snape even during shooting breaks. He did not want to forget what the nasty Snape was supposed to be like.\n\n\"You're as polite as possible, but it's not always possible,\" he said in 2011.\n\nRickman left behind his wife, Rima Horton. The two were together for 50 years.'"

            "text": "\tCHARLOTTE, N.C. - The poet and author Maya Angelou died Wednesday. She was 86.\n\nBut when you read her poems, you can still hear her rich, deep voice caressing every syllable:\n\n_Come you death, in haste, do come,_  \\n_My shroud of black be weaving,_  \\n_Quiet my heart, be deathly quiet,_  \\n_My true love is leaving._\n\n\"She was an extraordinary, charismatic person,\" Edwin Wilson said years ago. Wilson was once head of education at Wake Forest University. Angelou taught there for more than 30 years. \"She had a way of bringing an audience very much to within her grasp,\" he said.\n\nAfter Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he asked her to read a poem when he was sworn in. It was the first poem at an inauguration in 32 years.\n\nShe called it \"On the Pulse of the Morning,\" and in it she spoke of hope for the country's future. She also reminded listeners of two terrible moments from the past: slavery and the Trail of Tears, when Native Americans were forced out of the South and many died.\n\n_History, despite its wrenching pain_  \\n_Cannot be unlived, but if freed_  \\n_With courage, need not be lived again._\n\n## \"Swollen-Belly Poor\"\n\nAngelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St. Louis. She was raised by her grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas. She described her childhood as being \"swollen-belly poor.\" At 16, she had her only child, a son. She married and divorced at least two times.\n\nAngelou wrote poems, movies and songs. Besides writing, she was a dancer, actress, civil rights activist, streetcar conductor, Creole cook, cocktail waitress and filmmaker. She toured Europe and Africa in the 1950s as an entertainer. It was then that she started using the name Maya Angelou.\n\nIn 1969, she published her first book. \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" was a huge success. In it, she described being abused by her mother's boyfriend.\n\n\"I had to make a decision that I would tell a truth which might liberate me,\" Angelou said in 1994. Talking about her tough childhood helped set her free. And she hoped it might help others to set themselves free.\n\nMany women wrote letters to her after reading \"Caged Bird.\" It made them feel \"liberated enough to tell their mothers,\" she said.\n\n## She \"Read Everything\"\n\nThe book gave these women the strength stand up to those who abused them. They were able to say to them, \"This was cruel, what you did to me,\" Angelou said.\n\nShe dedicated the book to her son. And she also dedicated it to \"all the strong black birds of promise who defy the odds and gods and sing their songs.\"\n\nAfter being abused, Angelou said she rarely spoke for six years. When she did, she only spoke to her brother. The experience led to her becoming a writer.\n\nWhile she wasn't speaking, she \"read everything.\" She memorized the poems of writers she admired, Angelou said in 2002.\n\nAngelou did most of her writing in rented hotel rooms. She would take three books with her: a dictionary, a thesaurus and a Bible.\n\n## \"Love Of The Language\"\n\nIn 2001 she partnered with Hallmark Cards to make greeting cards. Some other poets disagreed with her decision.\n\nBilly Collins was the official poet of the U.S. back then. \"It lowers the understanding of what poetry actually can do,\" he said.\n\nAngelou said she saw it as a challenge: to simplify an inspiration into two sentences. \"I have not reduced my value or respect for words or love of the language,\" she said. \"I'm having a ball. It was exactly what I needed after 'A Song Flung Up to Heaven.'\"\n\n\"A Song Flung Up to Heaven\" was the sixth volume of her autobiography. It was the last volume she wrote. Published in 2002, it included memories of motherhood. It also tells of the assassinations in the 1960s of civil rights leaders Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Both were her friends.\n\nThe last sentence of that volume is the same as the first sentence of the first:\n\n\"What are you looking at me for?\" she wrote. \"I didn't come to stay.\"'"

            "text": "\tDUBAI, United Arab Emirates - A gallery in Dubai held an art sale on Monday. Collectors inside the gallery bought works by Syrian artists. Outside on the street, those same artists talked about events in Syria. They checked their smartphones to find out the latest on their country's civil war.\n\nThese Syrian artists now live in Dubai. They are able to continue their work in safety after the gallery brought them to the Gulf state. But they remain deeply connected to Syria. All of them are influenced by the bloodshed they left behind.\n\nMore than 100,000 people already have been killed in Syria's civil war. Now, there are plans to save Syria's artists. The art sale on Monday was part of that effort.\n\nGallery owner Hisham Samawi said what is happening in Syria is really bad. But it would be even worse if Syria lost all its art, he said. Samawi's Ayyam Gallery moved from Damascus to Dubai in late 2011. The Arab Spring rebellion was getting bigger at the time.\n\n## Getting Artists Out Of Syria\n\n\"For us,'\" Samawi added, \"the artists are part of our family. We had to do it. It was for us and for them.\"\n\nThe gallery moved 15 artists and their families to Dubai over nearly two years.\n\nAmong those the gallery has brought to Dubai is Tammam Azzam. He is one of the rising stars in Syria's revolution-inspired art world. His goal is to draw attention to the horrors of the war.\n\nOne piece, \"Freedom Graffiti,\" places a kissing couple over a bullet-scarred apartment wall. It made the 33-year-old Azzam famous. And it made him one of the leading artistic voices of the civil war.\n\nAnother of Azzam's pieces is a digital print called \"Syrian Olympics.\" This shows shooters aiming their guns at runners. It has the look of Olympic signs.\n\nA signed copy sold for $12,000. A copy of \"Freedom Graffiti\" brought in $6,000.\n\n\"I have to do something for the people there,\" said Azzam. He wanted to tell the world what was happening in his country, he said. \"People dying every day, every minute, and nobody can stop that.\"\n\n## A Wave Of Protest Art In The Middle East\n\nAzzam sometimes worries that \"art doesn't make sense\" in the middle of a war.\n\nBut war has always led to creativity. In the 18th-century, cartoonists commented on the American and French revolutions. In the 1930s artworks such as Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso)'s \"Guernica\" reflected the Spanish Civil War. And now, uprisings in the Middle East have led to a wave of protest art. Much of that art is being spread by the Internet.\n\nSince 2011, there have been dozens of important shows for the work of Arab Spring artists. Among those featured was Egyptian Ahmed Basiony. He was killed during anti-government protests in the final days of Hosni Mubarak's rule.\n\nIn Turkey this summer, anti-government protesters imitated Erdem Gunduz's \"Standing Man.\" As fighting raged around Istanbul's Taksim Square, they stood motionless. It was a form of performance art.\n\nThe artists are important, Samawi said. \"We had to get them out.\"\n\nHe also said: \"There was no question about it. It wasn't like: We'll go find other artists. These are our artists. We believe in them and believe they have a voice.\"\n\n## An Abandoned Art Studio\n\nSamawi hopes to bring other Syrian artists out of the country. But that is much harder to do now. The fighting has gotten worse.\n\n\"It's a good thing we started when we did,\" said Samawi. \"It becomes more and more difficult as every month passes.\"\n\nThe artist Azzam said friends are watching his abandoned art studio in Syria.\n\n\"But who knows if it will be there when I return,\" he said. \"And who knows when I can return.\"'"

They are an important part of a student's education, she said.\n\nThe arts, the first lady said, shouldn't just be an add-on. Art classes shouldn't be something introduced only after student test scores go up. Rather, they are a necessary part of the school day. They can help students achieve those higher test scores in the first place.\n\nMrs. Obama made her comments while opening the first-ever White House student talent show. At the event, student performers sang and danced. All attend schools that have been performing poorly. Their schools were chosen for a new arts education program.\n\nBy the end of the hour-long show, Mrs. Obama had joined the students on stage. She danced with them during their closing number.\n\n## Surprise Visit By The President\n\nPresident Barack Obama showed up as well. He broke away from his work to show  his support for arts in schools. The president congratulated the student performers.\n\nTuesday's talent show was meant to showcase the \"Turnaround Arts\" program. The program was created as an experiment in 2012. Its purpose is to see whether arts education can improve test scores. Famous artists adopted each school in the program.\n\n## So Far, So Good\n\nSo far, things have been going well: Reading and math scores have gone up. Mrs. Obama announced that the program is being expanded this year based on the results. Turnaround Arts is growing from the original eight schools to 35 schools.\n\nTwo of the original schools have already improved dramatically, she said. They have improved so much they are no longer in need of \"turnaround.\"\n\nThe arts, the first lady said, help get students excited about taking their seats in class. Students are happy to be in school. They look forward to the next musical they're performing in, or to playing an instrument.\n\n\"But if they're not in their seats then we can't teach them anything at all,\" Mrs. Obama said. \"The bottom line here is very clear: Arts education isn't something we add on.\" Arts, she said, shouldn't be introduced after goals like raising test scores have been achieved. They are all-important to achieving those goals in the first place.\n\n## Bring Arts Classes To More Schools\n\nSix million children do not have art or music instruction in their schools, she said. Millions more get only a very slight amount.\n\nThe president made his own pitch for arts education.\n\n\"The arts are central to who we are as a people, and they are central to the success of our kids. This is not an afterthought,\" he said. \"This is not something you do because it's kind of nice to do. It is necessary for these young people.\"\n\nA few big-name artists were at the White House event. Among them were the actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Alfre Woodard.\n\nThe stars performed with students from the schools they have adopted. They also spoke about the changes they have seen in their students.\n\n\"Our kids are glimpsing the fact that they have\" worth, Woodard said. \"That confidence just spreads across their lives.\"\n\n## Confidence Comes Out\n\nStudents spoke about what the arts mean to them, too.\n\n\"I think that the arts are important to our school,\" said 8-year-old Sinai Jones. Arts education gives kids \"an opportunity to see what they want to do in their life,\" she said. It gives them \"a level of confidence.\"\n\nSinai performed with an all-girl singing group.

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - No one has ever photographed British street artist Banksy, who goes by one name. But that doesn't mean people all over the world don't know who he is.\n\nBanksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England. Artworks placed in public areas like parks and streets without permission are called street art. Banksy is one of the most well known street artists in the world.\n\nIn October, New Yorkers got to see Banksy's work. That's because Banksy just ended a monthlong stay in the city.\n\nDuring his visit, Banksy created a painting, a drawing or a carved object each day. He then secretly placed them in public places. He also used stencils and spray-painted on streets, under bridges and on buildings. By the end of his stay, New Yorkers were wondering: Is he a fool or really talented?\n\n## Game Of Hide And Seek\n\nBanksy is known for his stencils of people, words, shapes and animals. He also opposes popular government ideas through his art.\n\nIn New York, Banksy put pictures of his work on a website and gave his fans clues about where to find the work. But he never revealed a street address. Fans had to track down his art. Once they did, large crowds gathered to see Banksy's work.\n\nBefore he left New York, Banksy donated a painting that he drew on. Before he put his stamp on it, the $50 painting was of mountains and a river. Banksy added a Nazi soldier from World War II to the painting, and then re-donated it to a Manhattan charity store called Housing Works. The charity store put Banksy's version of the painting up for sale. It eventually sold for $615,000. The money helped the charity.\n\nSome New Yorkers, such as Sean Lynch, like Banksy. Lynch thinks Banksy's visit to the city was magical. He liked hearing people talking about art that Banksy's work inspired. He said that people from different places with different ideas were sharing stories. \"The walls started to talk to them, in a way,\" Lynch said.\n\n## Essay Angers New Yorkers\n\nBut some New Yorkers see Banksy as a street punk and not an artist. They urged him to go back to England by posting on websites like Twitter.\n\nMany New Yorkers were offended by an essay Banksy wrote. In the essay, he called the building that replaced the World Trade Center boring. The World Trade Center was destroyed by a terror attack in 2001.\n\nBanksy said the new building \"so clearly (says) the terrorists won.\" He wanted The New York Times to print the essay, but the newspaper wouldn't do it. So Banksy posted it on his website.\n\nThe essay upset New Yorkers like Brian Major from Brooklyn. \"Enough!\" Major said. \"Shut up, Banksy! Go home!\"\n\nA lifelong New Yorker, Major says he understands graffiti as an art. But he doesn't think Banksy's art is very good. He does think that Banksy is good at selling his work.\n\n## Balloon Tag With A Building\n\nProfessor Radhika Subramaniam agrees. She says that Banksy is amazing because of the way he can gather large groups of people to see his secretive work.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wasn't a fan of Banksy's visit to New York. He called his graffiti a sign of a city falling apart and losing control.\n\nOn his last day in New York, Banksy tagged, or signed his name, to a building. The building is located in Queens, one of the five main parts of New York City. But Banksy didn't use spray paint. Instead, he spelled out his name with giant balloon letters.\n\nThe inflatable letters were stuck to one of the building's walls and later taken down by police. The police did not think the balloons were art. The artist joked that his farewell artwork was \"full of hot air.\"'"

King was a \"global musician.\" His music touched the whole world, not just American blues fans.\n\nKing was born in Mississippi on Sept. 16, 1925, on a plantation. His first name was really Riley. B.B. was his nickname.\n\nWhen he was young, King picked cotton. Soon, he realized he could make much more money playing guitar. In 1946, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to work to become a full-time musician.\n\nIn Memphis, King became known as \"the Blues Boy of Beale Street,\" then the Beale Street Blues Boy. This nickname was shortened to Bee Bee. Finally, it became simply B.B.\n\n## Many Others Tried B.B.'s Music Style\n\nKing developed an unusual way of performing. He had trouble singing and playing lead guitar at the same time. Soon he came up with a new approach. He would sing for a bit, then play a guitar solo, then sing a bit more. Many blues and rock guitarists later began doing the same thing. Everyone from Jimi Hendrix to John Mayer copied King.\n\nKing had a funny habit of calling his guitars \"Lucille.\" It went back to something that happened to him in the 1940s.\n\nIn 1949, a fight broke out between two men while King was playing at a dance. During the fight a lantern was knocked over. Soon, the barn was in flames. Everyone escaped unharmed. Then King realized he had left his guitar behind. King rushed back into the burning barn, putting himself in danger. When he found out that the men had been fighting over a woman named Lucille, he gave the name to his guitar. He figured the name would remind him \"never to do anything that foolish,\" he said.\n\nFrom then on, King named every guitar he owned \"Lucille.\"\n\n## So Many Shows To Play\n\nKing was a tireless performer. He never stopped giving concerts for more than a few days at a time. In 1956, he played 342 shows. Even as he got much older he played many shows every year. Most musicians half his age would have a hard time traveling and playing as much as he did.\n\nKing worked with hundreds of musicians from all kinds of backgrounds. In 1989 he teamed up with the Irish rock band U2. Together, they released the song \"When Love Comes to Town.\" It brought B.B. King to the attention of millions of young rock fans. At the time, he was more than 60 years old.\n\n## His Music Will Live On With Fans\n\nRock musicians had helped make King better known once before.\n\nEarly on, King's fans were mostly African-American. By the 1960s, many blacks were no longer interested in listening to the blues. King became less popular.\n\nThen British rock musicians discovered the blues. The Rolling Stones, Clapton, Van Morrison and others began telling their young fans how great King was.\n\nThe attention from British rockers put B.B. King in front of a whole new audience. King really became famous after he released the song \"The Thrill Is Gone\" in 1969. In 1971, he won his first Grammy Award.\n\nKing recorded more than 50 albums. At one time, he said he could not remember how many records he had made. In 1987, he was voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He received many other music awards as well for his long career.'"

            "text": "\tSASABE, Ariz. - On a windy day near the Arizona border with Mexico, Glenn Weyant had everything he needed to make music. He had his cello bow and a hammer. But, he wasn't going to play a musical instrument. He plays the fence dividing the United States and Mexico.\n\nWeyant's music is low-tech. He's turned a tin can into a microphone. He presses it against the fence. Wires attached to the tin lead to an amp to make the sound louder.\n\nDesert grasses, some trees and rocks were his only audience.\n\n\"Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people,\" he said.\n\nHe wants his music to spark conversation between people on both sides of the fence. Weyant says people view the fence with fear.\n\n## Playing The Fence\n\nThe fence was built up to keep people from coming into the U.S. Often people try to enter the U.S. even if they aren't allowed to. Many are just searching for better jobs. Worries about terrorism have led to the fence getting built up even more.\n\nFor eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting sounds. His songs can last a minute, or more than a half hour.\n\nWeyant, 50, moved to Tucson 19 years ago when much of the border fence in southern Arizona was barbed wire. It seemed forbidden.\n\nIt's not against the law to touch it. But people tend to stay away from the fence anyway.\n\nHe had been drawn to unusual sounds his whole life. When he was a boy he enjoyed listening to the noise of his grandfather's electric fan. One day in 2005 he decided that he wanted to hear what sounds the fence could make.\n\nIn Nogales, he played a fence made of old helicopter landing pads. He'd record the noise from birds landing on top of the fence. The sounds of cars passing through the border checkpoint also got picked up.\n\nIn Sasabe, he created a delicate raspy sound. He played rusty mattress wires with his cello bow. Ranchers had stretched the wires between fence posts to keep their cattle from straying into Mexico.\n\n## An Armed Audience\n\nWeyant is more interested in creating effects than melodies. His songs can last a minute - or more than half an hour.\n\nFor the most part, Border Patrol agents have left him alone.\n\n\"I'm a white male playing the border wall,\" Weyant said. He says he believes that is why he's allowed to keep playing.\n\nSome agents have greeted him with friendly curiosity.\n\n\"Why are you playing a wall?\" one asked.\n\nAnother radioed his boss: \"There's a guy playing the wall. Is he allowed to do that?\"\n\nA few agents have warned him about people on the southern side of the fence.\n\n\"Hey, you know they throw rocks,\" one told him.\n\n\"Usually,\" Weyant said, \"when you play in a venue, you don't have people with guns watching you.\" Still, he's never had any dangerous run-ins with people on either side of the fence.\n\n## Harsher Border Than Before\n\nAbout once a month he gets to the border to play. He has spoken about his music at universities. Videos of his music are on YouTube. Musicians have added his border sounds to their own works. Weyant sells his music, and sometimes donates it.\n\nSections of the fence were once weak and thin. Now they've been built into tall, strong structures.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, crews installed a fence near Sasabe made of steel columns.\n\nFew have heard the border change, but Weyant has. The sounds, like the fence, are often harsher than before.\n\nWeyant said the border wall is a fitting place to make music. It's haunted with stories.\n\n\"This section is where hundreds of people die,\" he said. The people sometimes starve to death or die from lack of water.\n\nDusty handprints stood out against the rust of the fence near Sasabe. \"Was it just a kid who jumped the fence? So many stories,\" Weyant said.'"

            "text": "b\"BERLIN - Winnie-the-Pooh is one of the most famous characters in the world. Children all over the world have grown up with Pooh and his friends. Not everyone knows, however, that Pooh is a real bear.\n\nWell, sort of. There really was a stuffed bear named Pooh that belonged to a little boy named Christopher Robin. That boy's father, A.A. Milne, wrote the Pooh stories about his son's favorite stuffed animals.\n\nThe original Winnie-the-Pooh is still around. In fact, if you are in New York City, you can go see him. He lives in the Children's Corner at the New York Public Library. His friends Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger and Kanga are there too.\n\n## The Little Bear's Long Life\n\nPooh is not a native New Yorker. He is actually from England. Recently, some people in England have been asking to have the bear sent back home.\n\nPooh's story is a long one. A.A. Milne bought Pooh for his son Christopher Robin in 1921. He began writing stories about the bear and his friends, and soon Winnie-the-Pooh became famous. Christopher Robin Milne kept his original Pooh until 1947. Then he gave the bear to the company in America that sold his father's books. He joked that since he was a grown up, he was too old to keep his stuffed animals.\n\nPooh stayed at the company until 1987. Then he was given to another company, which handed him over to the New York Public Library. The library does not just lend books. It is also a museum with things from important books and famous writers.\n\nThe library is in the middle of New York City. The bear has lived there ever since. Some people in England feel this is unfair.\n\n## But Pooh Seems Happy In New York\n\nShould Pooh stay in New York or return to England? Recently, the newspaper, The Times of London, wrote an article about this question. The article said that Pooh should be returned to England.\n\nThe Times gave a few reasons. First, the Winnie-the-Pooh stories were written in England. The Times said this makes Pooh English. So the bear should live in England.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh is not an American, The Times argued.\n\nSecond, the newspaper said that Pooh would be given a warm welcome in England. If Pooh returned to England, he might get his own museum. The museum would be in East Sussex, a part of southeastern England. This is where the real Christopher Robin used to play with Pooh.\n\nThe New York Public Library disagrees. Angela Montefinise, who works at the library, said Pooh is comfortable where he is.\n\nPooh is nearly 100 years old. After all those years, he is very delicate. Because of this, it could be risky to send Pooh to England. He might fall apart during the trip.\n\nAlso, the English are not the only ones with strong feelings for Winnie-the-Pooh. He matters to many New Yorkers, too.\n\n## Who Doesn't Love Pooh?\n\nWhy all the fuss? Pooh is just a stuffed animal, after all. Why would anyone argue about Winnie-the-Pooh?\n\nThe answer may be that Pooh is very important to many people, even grown-ups. People really love Pooh. In both America and England, people have fond memories of reading and watching Pooh stories as children. As a result, they have strong feelings about the stuffed bear.\n\nAlso, some people feel that Pooh is an important part of English history. This may be another reason why that they want to bring the bear home.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Pooh stay in New York or go back to England? Unfortunately, we cannot just ask where he wants to live. Unlike the Winnie-the-Pooh from the stories, this Pooh does not talk.\""

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Steve Barnett was put in charge of Capitol Records in 2012. The record company was started in 1942. It had recorded albums for big stars in music like the Beatles and Frank Sinatra.\n\nWhen Barnett came to Capitol, he cleared out the old records hanging on the office walls. They were a sign of what he had to fix. Capitol was stuck in the past. It could not think about the future, Barnett said.\n\nBarnett had been president of Columbia Records. Columbia was the top record label in the United States. Capitol was the fifth-largest, but it moved up to second place after Barnett took over.\n\n## No More Yesterday\n\nBarnett made big changes at Capitol Records. He picked different artists. He signed two of the biggest acts of last year, Sam Smith and 5 Seconds of Summer.\n\nRecord companies have to sign contracts with musicians and artists to record their albums. Then the companies sell and promote the records.\n\nThe 2015 Grammy awards were good to Capitol Records' artists. Their musicians got 46 nominations. Smith got six nominations for his first album and was nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.\n\nCapitol had been hurt by changes in the music business over the years. Fans went from buying CDs to downloading songs and albums. Now they can hear some music online for free. Experts said Capitol was managed badly. It did not spend money on developing new artists.\n\n## Turning The Beat Around\n\nUniversal Music Group bought Capitol Records in 2012. They brought new owners to Capitol. The owners said they wanted to help the workers turn the company around.\n\nThe new owners said the people working at Capitol already had the skills, talent and dedication. They just needed the right tools to become great.\n\nThe first step for the new owners was finding the right leader to make Capitol better. They hired Barnett.\n\nBarnett had been a manager of music stars. He also worked with singer Adele and the popular boy band, One Direction.\n\nBarnett has been a fan of Capitol's artists since he was a kid growing up in England. He liked the Beatles and Beach Boys.\n\n## Everyone's A Fan\n\nMany artists and their managers are fans of Barnett.\n\nSinger Sam Smith said he met with many record companies before he signed on with Capitol. He said he liked how Capitol respected him and his music. It was a done deal when he met Barnett, he said.\n\nBarnett also liked Sam Smith. He felt Smith would be a success. He was right. Smith's first album sold millions of copies. Only Taylor Swift's \"1989\" and the \"Frozen\" soundtrack sold more copies than him last year. Katy Perry's album \"Prism\" also did very well for Capitol.\n\nBarnett said Capitol Records is back to working well. Two years after he arrived, Capitol is on a new path.\n\n\"I think we're in the game,\" Barnett said.'"

            "text": "\tPRIVAS, France - In 1994, French explorers found a huge cave. Inside, the walls were covered with some of the oldest pictures ever painted.\n\nMost people will never see them. The French government quickly closed the cave to visitors. They worried that people could destroy the pictures. Even breathing on them could damage them.\n\nSoon, people will get to see the next best thing. France has made an almost perfect copy about a mile away.\n\nThe copy includes more than 400 paintings of horses, bears and rhinos. There are handprints and carvings. Experts even copied the shapes of rocks from the old cave. The copy of the cave will open to visitors in a few weeks.\n\n## First They Saw Red Paint\n\nJean-Marie Chauvet is one of the three men who discovered the old cave. Chauvet is still amazed by what the men found.\n\nChauvet said he and the other explorers saw air coming out of a crack in a rock. They decided to look more closely. Chauvet crawled through narrow tunnels with only his flashlight. Suddenly, another explorer saw two lines of red paint on a cave wall.\n\nChauvet said that the paintings were still very bright. They looked as if artists had just finished painting them. The deeper the explorers went, the more beautiful the art became.\n\nThe cave was very well-preserved because rocks fell in front of the opening about 23,000 years ago. The rocks hid the cave's entrance. The drawings stayed in perfect shape. At first, some experts could not believe that they were real.\n\n## What Shall It Be Named?\n\nThe paintings were likely made 30,000 to 37,000 years ago. When the cave was found, experts thought they were the oldest human cave drawings ever. Now they think that pictures in a cave in Spain were painted earlier. The Spanish cave drawings were made at least 40,000 years ago.\n\nToday, the French government calls the Chauvet cave, Pont d'Arc Cavern. It is not officially named after the men who found it. Chauvet is not happy about that. In fact, most people call it Chauvet's Cave. He thinks it should be named after him and that he should get money for finding it.\n\nExperts have recorded more than 1,000 paintings from the cave. Last year, it was added to the United Nations' list of world treasures. A famous filmmaker made a 3-D movie about it called \"Cave of Forgotten Dreams.\"\n\n## The Caves Look Alike\n\nArtists tried to make the copy look as much like the original cave as possible. No one really knows how the ancient artists painted it. Experts have a good idea though. The artists tried to paint it the same way it was done 30,000 years ago, using the same tools.\n\nPascal Terrasse is a French lawmaker in charge of making the new cave look like the old one.\n\nTerrasse said the next step could be to make 3-D images of the original cave. Then people would not have to come to France to see it. A 3-D copy of the cave would bring the paintings to life for people around the world.'"

There are even mechanical kites.\n\nZhang is one of China's most loved kite makers. The 65-year-old showed off some of his life's work. He talked about why kite flying is good for you.\n\n\"Flying a kite provides good exercise,\" he said. It also builds friendships. He says it puts people in a better mood.\n\nChinese kite makers have many worries. As China becomes more modern, young people are playing video games instead of flying kites. The kite makers are getting old. Almost all of them are men.\n\n## A Kite Maker Remembers\n\nChina is very proud of its kites. They are an invention that helped mathematicians and scientists later invent airplanes and other things. Still, the future of this old craft is far from certain.\n\nWeifang is a city that calls itself China's kite capital. Han Fuling is a kite maker from Weifang. He is 82 years old. He has been making traditional kites for almost his whole life. He can remember the special feeling when he built his first kite. He saw it float into the air. He was only 7 years old.\n\nTimes have changed. Han does not think that any of his four children will make kites.\n\n## Hard Times For Kites\n\nKite making is only part of a bigger story in China. People do not appreciate art as much. Historic buildings, crafts and music are being erased. China is growing but it does not have time for art. The country is not able to keep its older way of life.\n\nChina's kite masters have been through hard times before. The country used to be run by an emperor, or king. After World War II, Chairman Mao Zedong took over. In the 1960s and 1970s, China had a \"Cultural Revolution.\"\n\nChairman Mao was a strict leader. He wanted to make people listen to him. He decided to make sure artists listened to him. Sometimes art can make people find problems with the government. Mao tried to control art. Kite makers had to change, too.\n\nHan Fuling followed Mao Zedong's strict rules. He started making kites that showed workers. Mao thought this would cause people to only think of work. Before, kites used to have drawings of ancient gods or heroes.\n\nFuling has bad memories from that time. A kite artist named Fei Baoling lived in another city. He went through the same thing. Fei had to ruin his beautiful kites. He had to follow Mao's rules.\n\nWith a new ruler, kite art changed back. Artists could paint the ancient gods and heroes again.\n\n## Keeping Kite Making Alive\n\nChina is home to many schools of kite making. There are artists in many different cities. In Beijing, Fei is widely known as an expert. He is good at painting designs on kites.\n\nFei's eyes do not work as well as they used to. It can be hard to paint when he cannot see well. Still, he tries to teach people to paint on kites. Sun He is one of his students.\n\nHe is a 36-year-old car mechanic who began studying with Fei in 2003. He wanted to make kites as beautiful as Fei.\n\nSun said his fascination with kites started with his grandfather, who taught him the old accents and ways of Beijing, including Beijing opera.\n\nWhen Sun meets a young person interested in Chinese culture, he is eager to talk to them. But he said it does not happen often.\n\nPeople do not usually fly traditional kites, Sun says. They buy cheap, triangle kites from toy stores \"and fly them at the bridges.\"'"

They're called the American Hollywood Film Orchestra, and they were far from California.\n\nThe musicians, who are in a large group called an orchestra, have been traveling all around China. Beijing was their latest stop.\n\nThey've been traveling the country by bus, train and plane. They'd been to more than 12 cities from late December to mid-January. At each stop, they offer up crowd-pleasing tunes from movies like \"Titanic,\" \"The Incredibles\" and \"The Godfather.\"\n\nTo save money, the group doesn't lug large instruments.  Promoters in each town let them borrow drums and other instruments. But sometimes there are problems.\n\n## Long, Hard Days On Tour\n\nOn this Saturday evening in Beijing, two players opened the cases to the instruments they were borrowing. They found some of them were damaged. Drummer Chris Nolan was furious.\n\n\"Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!\" he exclaimed. He pointed at the loose drum heads. Helpers with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and other workers buzzed around the stage deciding what to do.\n\nBut as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on. And so it did. Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show of famous movie songs.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri got on stage. He raised his arm and the concert began.\n\nThey tried to connect with the Chinese crowd. The group performed music from \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" a popular Chinese movie. The performers also surprised the audience with a song from an old Chinese movie but with a twist from \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Star Wars\" mixed in.\n\nThe orchestra has long, hard days. They wake up at 5:30 a.m. They don't eat dinner until 11 p.m. Travel, practice, and shows are in between. Their busy days show how popular they are.\n\nSome performers just graduated college. Others are older, like Jack Cobos. He's a retired carpet salesman who used to play violin with another music group. And he's turning 71 during this year. They're not famous. But in smaller cities, they have been swarmed by crowds eager to take pictures after their shows.\n\n## Singing Along In A Park\n\nSometimes, the concert halls are freezing cold. Or they're still being built. Jason Heidelberg, a cellist from Cleveland, said this year they arrived in a town called Haiyang. \"The floor was still not done - they just put red carpet over it,\" he said.\n\nJohn Bryant plays the trumpet. He has toured with the group twice. He said that in 2009 the group's plane was grounded by a snowstorm in another area of China called Shenyang. The musicians had to ride on a crowded train. They made it to their next concert, in Xian, 90 minutes late.\n\n\"Playing after like 18 hours of travel was crazy,\" he said. They didn't even have time to change, he said, \"we just went straight to the concert in our traveling clothes.\"\n\nMost of the performers say they're not touring for the money. They have the chance to see a bit of China. They enjoy the companionship of their fellow music lovers. And they have a chance to connect with people who speak a different language and live in a different land.\n\nConductor Altieri recalled being in an area of China called Ningbo. The group stumbled across a music school where an old man was teaching children the erhu.  It is a traditional Chinese two-stringed instrument. The Americans watched for half an hour. The kids staged an unplanned concert for them. Later, the Americans found a group of people performing karaoke in a park, and joined in.\n\n\"All the karaoke people ended up buying tickets to our show. They even came backstage and gave us flowers,\" Altieri said. \"That's what I love about doing this - making music and sharing it.\"'"

            "text": "\tMusic has been a big part of the struggle for civil rights for a long time. It still is today.\n\nThe recent movie \"Selma\" has an example. The movie is about people marching in Alabama in the 1960s to make sure African-Americans could vote. At the time, voting was legal for African-Americans. But many white officials in the South stopped them from voting. They would threaten them and make it harder for them to vote.\n\nThe movie has a song called \"Glory.\" It is performed by the rapper Common. He tells how words, music and a protest were brought together. \"Glory\" won best original song at the Academy Awards on Sunday.\n\n## Still Singing And Protesting\n\nMany African-Americans were badly hurt during the march from Selma 50 years ago. Now, there are new issues facing black people in America.\n\n\"The movement is a rhythm to us, freedom is like religion to us,\" Common raps. Then he mentions the 1950s civil rights pioneer, Rosa Parks. Parks refused to move from her seat on a city bus for a white person. Common connects Parks with last year's protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Those protests started after a police officer shot a black teenager. His name was Michael Brown and he didn't have a weapon.\n\nPeople were angry about the death of Brown. They were also upset about the death of Eric Garner in New York. He was black, did not have a weapon, and was killed by a white police officer.\n\nNewsweek magazine talked about the fight for civil rights in 1964. There had never been a fight for rights that was so full of music, Newsweek said.\n\n## \"Freedom Songs\" Inspire Marchers\n\nDuring the 1960s, there were African-American \"freedom songs.\" They helped inspire protesters to march into dangerous situations. The songs also spread news of the struggle to a bigger audience.\n\nThe gospel, or religious music of black churches, talked about a better life in heaven. There were other types of music as well. Soul music, jazz music and R&amp;B talked about life changing for the better.\n\nChicago's Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke and the Staples Singers were musicians at the time.\n\nMayfield wrote and sang on records that had a message. The songs were inspired by pain and struggle. The three Selma marches in 1965 were meant to draw attention to the struggle for black voting rights. They were important events in the struggle. Police used weapons on the protesters. They hit them and let their dogs attack them. They also used a special gas. The gas would hurt the protesters' eyes and make it hard to breathe.\n\n## Still Riding The \"Freedom Highway\"\n\nThe protesters had no weapons. They had no way to protect themselves. Many watched the protests and were shocked. Even the president noticed. Soon, Congress passed a law. The law made it harder for states to stop people from voting.\n\nPops Staples led a well-known Chicago gospel group. It was called the Staples Singers. He saw news coverage of the event. Staples was horrified. He had become friends with Martin Luther King Jr. Staples and his family had been appearing at Civil Rights rallies with King. What he saw and experienced with King made him political. He wrote a song called \"Freedom Highway.\"\n\n\"If he can preach it, we can sing it,\" he told the members of his group.\n\nPops continued writing and singing about the movement until just before he died. His final recording shows this. \"Don't Lose This\" was released this week. It was recorded with his children in the years before his death in 2000.\n\nOn \"Sweet Home,\" Pops and his daughter, Mavis, sing a duet. The struggle they joined during the '60s shows no sign of ending. \"Lord, I wonder will I ever get home?\" they sing. Their voices sound tired. Still, they are fighting for their rights. They are still on the \"freedom highway.\"'"

Their school is for people who want to learn about music, art and performance. Before, they used to go to Winterfield Elementary School. Winterfield has a program with the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra (CSO).\n\nThe CSO program teaches kids how to play musical instruments. Justice learned to play the violin. Nathaniel learned to play the violin and the cello. They are the first students from the program to go to Northwest.\n\n## Most Families Can't Afford Lessons\n\nFor the past six years, the CSO has taught after-school classes at Winterfield. Kids in grades 2 through 5 learned how to play music. More than three-quarters of the students come from poor homes. Their families are not able to afford music lessons.\n\nThe CSO wants to know if the music class helps kids in other ways. They hope it helps them stay out of trouble, have better attendance and get better grades.\n\nMusic helped Justice and Nathaniel get into a good middle school. Endora Crawford is Justice's mom.

He said that the music helps Nathaniel focus. He said, \"It makes a big difference.\"\n\n## Kids Learn It's Smart To Practice\n\nWhen the program started, the goals were simple, but important. First, the program wanted to teach kids to take responsibility for something valuable. They are allowed to take smaller instruments home to practice. Second, the program encouraged cooperation. Students spend time with children they might not know outside of the program. Third, the program taught students to practice. When students get better after practice, they learn that practice is smart. This transfers to studying for other classes in school.\n\nThe same kids cannot always come back every year. Chris Stonnell is in the CSO. He said, \"Winterfield has a constantly changing population, and we struggle with that. Not a lot of kids go there for four straight years. But this year, we're working with 83 students.\"\n\n## Parents Invited To School\n\nStonnell said that the music is important, but so is the community. He wants to get the parents to come to school and be involved, too.\n\nBefore the program, music was something Justice and Nathaniel found on the Internet. They did not think of it as something to play. Justice had never picked up a stringed instrument before coming to Winterfield two years ago. Nathaniel had not until he joined the music program a year before that.\n\nStudents use the first year to explore and find a \"forever instrument,\" as Courtney Hollenbeck calls it. Hollenbeck is a teacher at Winterfield. She started the music program in 2009\\\\. Justice tried out the clarinet and cello before selecting a violin. Nathaniel enjoyed the trumpet but decided on the cello and violin.\n\n\"When I started, it actually looked easy, but I knew it would get tougher,\" says Nathaniel. \"Practicing is a pleasure. I'm always trying to get a song perfect, so I'm playing 15-20-25 minutes a day, plus working on my keyboard. It's a big step for me, going to a school where almost everything you do is (related to) the arts.\"'"

            "text": "\tORANGEBURG, S.C. - Leo Twiggs' paintings might be disturbing to some people. Many show the Confederate flag. During the Civil War it was the symbol of the South.\n\nOther paintings by him show faceless men with bulls-eyes on their backs. They are meant to reflect his life as a black man in the South.\n\nTwiggs is not trying to upset anyone. The 80-year-old South Carolina artist says his paintings are meant to get people thinking. He hopes they help people to better understand our nation's history.\n\n\"This Confederate flag, the Civil War, they are part of the history of all of us,\" Twiggs said. \"Take the stars off the bars\" of the Confederate flag, he said. \"It becomes a cross, maybe a railroad crossing. It can become a crossing over.\"\n\nHe means it can become something we remember, but have moved beyond.\n\n## There's A Cow On The Flag\n\nTwiggs said he is enjoying his best year ever as an artist. Three new shows of his art recently opened. Over the years, he has had more than 70 shows.\n\nTwo of Twiggs' new shows give a good idea of how he uses Confederate flags. His flags are colored red, white, or blue. They are smudged with brown or blood-red splotches. In several cases, brown figures are in the background. Many flags are tattered. They look worn and rough.\n\nA black cow stands watching in some of the flag paintings. As a child, Twiggs took care of such an animal.\n\nTwiggs has been making flag pictures since the 1970s.\n\n\"He's not trying to divide everybody,\" art expert Sandy Rupp said. Twiggs changes the Confederate flag by adding things from his own experience.\n\n\"He makes it his flag, and gives it his power,\" Rupp said.\n\n## Flags Represent Many Things\n\nA single artwork can take him a month to finish. Twiggs starts by using a metal tool to drip warm wax on a piece of cloth. He colors the wax with dye, then removes it with an iron. He repeats each step over and over.\n\nOther ideas fill Twiggs' work as well. In some pieces, the Confederate flag is made to look like a railroad-crossing sign. It is meant to represent the tracks in many small Southern towns. They sometimes separate black and white neighborhoods.\n\nFor many, the Confederate flag is a reminder of when whites kept blacks as slaves.\n\nTwiggs, however, takes that flag and changes it. It becomes part of his experience. In that way, it becomes his flag too.'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK, N.Y. - Misty Copeland is a ballerina who is becoming very famous. She has been on television and danced in a play. She is even the star of her own movie. Copeland has also just made history. She is the first African-American ballerina who has a lead part with a famous ballet company.\n\nCopeland is 33 years old and has done all of those things just this year. She has even gone to dinner at the White House.\n\nCopeland dances with a company called the American Ballet Theatre. She is starting her first season a principal ballerina. A star of a ballet company who dances in leading parts is a principal dancer.\n\n## First African-American Star For Ballet Company\n\nShe is an example to many people because she is the first African-American woman who is a principal dancer in the company. The dance company has been around for 75 years.\n\nRight before she was given her new name, she starred in a show called \"Swan Lake.\" It was really hard for Copeland because the world was watching.\n\nThe ballerina also had another problem. She had to dance in the show and not let the people watching know that she was in pain. Copeland had an operation three years ago to fix cracks in her leg bone. \"It's been three years and I'm still not jumping fully,\" she says.\n\nCopeland must keep dancing with her hurt leg. She also says that the people watching cannot know when her leg aches.\n\n## Movie Tells Dancer's Story After Injury\n\nNelson George is a man who makes movies. He saw Copeland dance when her leg was still hurt. He noticed that she was in pain. George suggested that they make a movie to tell her story.\n\nThey made a movie called \"A Ballerina's Tale.\" The movie shows her first dance class after the operation. It also shows a dance that she performed by herself. Copeland says that she was not at her best. \"It's so hard to watch! But it was just something I had to do,\" she says.\n\nThe movie shows that Copeland felt lonely. She was not sure of herself because many of the other ballet dancers were white. Copeland says in the movie that some people say she thinks too much about being a black ballerina. She says that is what makes her victory extra important. \"I'm a black ballerina,\" she says.\n\n## Starring Part Means Less Time Dancing\n\nShe is excited to be a principal dancer. Copeland also says the big part means that she gets to dance less. There are many principals who want the starring parts.\n\nShe will try to dance as much as she can. And she may someday do more acting. She only had time to star in a Broadway play for two weeks. Many famous plays are shown in a part of New York City called Broadway.\n\nCopeland says that she is only thinking about ballet now and that she cannot just show up to dance whenever she wants. \"It just doesn't work that way. It's not a hard balance,\" she says. \"The dance is always first.\"\n\n'"

Her name is Liz Rose, a country music songwriter.\n\nRose has written songs for some of the biggest names in country music. In 2010, she won a Grammy Award with Taylor Swift for the best country song. The music award was for a song called \"White Horse.\" On this fall day, she helped 19 middle school students write their own song. They called it \"Everybody's Perfect.\"\n\n## \"Y'all Made Me Cry\"\n\n\"Y'all are awesome,\" said Rose, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. \"Y'all made me cry.\"\n\nThere is not much country music in New York City. It has only one country radio station that began just two years ago. Still, musicians from Nashville are working with a group teaching music to school children. Nashville is the center of the country music business.\n\nThe students go to Pelham Gardens Middle School. There are about 500 students in 15 schools in the songwriting program. They receive 10 lessons on how to write the words to a song. One class in each school gets to talk over the Internet with a musician in Nashville.\n\nThe Nashville-New York connection is made through the Country Music Association Foundation. The group began in 2006 to help pay for music education programs in Nashville.\n\n## Sharing The Stage With Stars\n\nRose first met her students over Skype. The app lets people talk and see each other and talk over the Internet. Rose helped the students write the words for their song. They performed it this past week at All for the Hall. The concert took place in New York City. It raised money for educational programs at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. Students shared the stage with musicians Brad Paisley, Paul Simon and Carrie Underwood.\n\n\"Ice cream, money and MetroCards and full backpacks and school is hard!\" the students sang. Metrocards are fare cards for New York trains and buses. The students' song had lots of oohs and aahs in it. It had an upbeat, catchy melody.\n\nFor many of the New York kids, country music was totally new.\n\n## City Kids Learn Country Music\n\nCorey Stuckey is 12 years old. He said he decided to write his own songs after listening to hip-hop and R&amp;B songs. Now he is opening up to country, too.\n\n\"I like country music because of the tone of it,\" the seventh-grader said. He called country music \"calming.\"\n\nRose said she worked with the kids on their song just like she works with professional musicians. She had the students shout out whatever was on their minds. They came up with things like, older kids are tall, ice cream and hallways. She quickly wrote down everything they said. Then she started to place the words together like puzzle pieces.\n\n\"It's not different for whoever you're writing with. It's about getting them to talk,\" she said, \"and then I would ask them questions and put a line together.\"\n\n## A New Song: \"Everybody's Perfect\"\n\nIn the end, they wrote \"Everybody's Perfect.\"\n\nMoesha Masters, who is 11 years old, helped come up with the title.\n\n\"I moved a lot and it was hard making friends,\" she said. \"And I realized I'm not perfect. But after I looked at that I realized everyone's perfect in other ways.\"\n\nKyle Young is in charge of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He said he felt emotional when he saw the students on the stage.\n\n\"This is why we go to work every day,\" Young said. \"It's about giving kids an opportunity to express themselves and create.\"'"

            "text": "\tSAN FRANCISCO - Hani Khan got a job working at a Hollister store near San Francisco in 2009. Khan wore a Muslim headscarf called a hijab. That was not a problem at first.\n\nThen a boss visited the store and saw Khan wearing the hijab. The boss complained. Khan would not take off the hijab. Hollister fired Khan in 2010.\n\nThe U.S. government decided to take the case to court on Khan's behalf. It sued Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Abercrombie owns the Hollister chain.\n\nNow Abercrombie has agreed to change its rules about how employees can dress. The agreement was announced on Monday\n\n## Freedom Of Religion\n\nThe rules will better protect women wearing the hijab, said Khan's lawyers.\n\nKhan is now 23. She recently graduated from college.\n\n\"I felt it was right for me to stand up to it,\" Khan said.\n\nThe retailer has agreed to pay Khan $48,000. It will also pay $21,000 to a second woman, Halla Banafa. She applied for a job at a Hollister store when she was 18. But she did not get hired because she wore a hijab.\n\nKhan said the last 3 1/2 years have been a \"roller coaster.\" Still, the fight was worthwhile.\n\n\"For that to happen to me when I wasn't doing anything wrong was very surprising and shocking,\" she told reporters. \"But I'm really happy with how it turned out.\"\n\n## Civil Rights Act Lawsuit\n\nThe U.S. government sued Abercrombie in 2011. The lawsuit said Abercrombie had violated the Civil Rights Act. The law says people cannot be treated unfairly at work because of their religion.\n\nJudge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in Khan's favor Sept. 3. The ruling set up a trial later this month. The trial would have decided how much money Khan would get. Instead the two sides reached an agreement. Abercrombie did not admit it broke the law.\n\nLast week the judge who heard Banafa's case approved an agreement for both women. Abercrombie agreed that employees and people who wanted jobs could wear religious clothing. The only time they could not was if it would create an \"undue hardship\" for the company. \"Undue hardship\" is a legal term. It means wearing the clothes would cause a really bad problem.\n\n## Retraining Managers\n\nThe women's lawyers said the retailer will have trouble proving the headscarves cause a problem. The company already tried to show that the hijabs hurt Abercrombie's business. The judges both rejected their claims.\n\nAbercrombie will also set up a way for employees to appeal if they are told they cannot wear religious clothing. The retailer will also retrain its managers. They will relearn the company's rules about the headscarves.\n\nAbercrombie said Monday that it was glad to put these \"very old matters\" behind it.\n\n\"Abercrombie &amp; Fitch does not discriminate based on religion,\" the company said.\n\n## Not The First Claims Against A&amp;F\n\nAbercrombie has had problems before. In 2004 the retailer paid $40 million to settle a different lawsuit. People said that it was unfair to people who were not white when it hired. Shoppers refused to go to the stores in 2005. They were angry about certain girls' T-shirts the retailer sold.\n\nThe company has been very successful since CEO Mike Jeffries took over in 1992. But sales were down over the first half of 2013. The slump coincided with another incident. An interview Jeffries gave to Salon.com in 2006 came up again. Jeffries said in the interview that his company's clothes are intended only for \"cool\" and \"attractive\" kids.\n\nThe company announced in January it would close 40 to 50 U.S. stores. It plans to concentrate on growing in other countries.\n\nAbercrombie operates more than 900 stores in the United States. More than half of them are under the Hollister brand. Hollister is a casual clothing line. Hollister calls men and women \"Dudes\" and \"Bettys.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - On Tuesday, President Barack Obama made a bold pledge. More than $33 billion will soon be spent on helping Africa. Some of the money will come from the U.S. government. Some of the money will come from U.S. businesses. The idea is to help African businesses to grow.\n\nAt the same time, he said, there is another goal: To help American companies make more money buying and selling in Africa.\n\nAfrica has many valuable natural resources - that is, products of the Earth. Among them are oil, minerals, metals, cotton and various foodstuffs. It also has a huge population, and they are getting richer. American companies may soon find many new customers in Africa.\n\n## Developing Businesses Differently\n\nObama made the announcement as he spoke at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. The event was the first of its kind. It was also the largest meeting any American president has ever held with African leaders.\n\nCountries including China have held such events for years. All have been interested in buying oil and other natural resources from Africa.\n\n\"We don't look to Africa simply for its natural resources,\" Obama said. \"We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people.\" Africans, he said, are rich with talent and promise.\n\nObama didn't mention any of the other non-African countries. China, however, has been criticized for its behavior. It doesn't develop businesses in Africa, some say. Instead, it simply buys up raw materials like oil and minerals. It then processes them - treats and prepares them for use - back in China.\n\nAfrican countries end up making less money than they might otherwise. What's more, they learn nothing about processing materials themselves.\n\nIn addition, Chinese companies in Africa rarely hire African workers. The only jobs Africans get are the lowest-level ones.\n\nThe United States wants to do things differently, Obama said.\n\n## Goals And Other \"Enormous Challenges\"\n\nIt won't be about removing \"minerals from the ground\" to benefit the United States, Obama said. The goal is to increase \"jobs and opportunity for all our peoples.\"\n\nU.S. companies in Africa don't behave like Chinese companies, said Africa expert Witney Schneidman. American companies hire and train Africans. As a result, Africans learn new skills and over time, earn more money.\n\nSome have said the United States hasn't been paying enough attention to Africa.\n\n\"We are missing the boat,\" former President Bill Clinton said. \"This is a very important part of our future.\"\n\nObama said that the continent still faces \"enormous challenges.\" Among them are poverty, wars, hunger and disease. Still, he said, \"a new Africa\" is being born.\n\nTanzania President Jakaya Kikwete agreed. Africa, he said, still has its problems. However, many of its 53 countries have changed for the better over the past 10 years. Other speakers noted that Africa is growing in wealth. Six of the 10 fastest-growing countries in the world are in Africa.\n\n## Business On The Menu\n\nThe new attention to Africa wasn't only seen in speeches. On Tuesday night, the president and first lady Michelle Obama gave a dinner at the White House. The menu included African dishes.\n\nOver the last 10 years, China has done more business in Africa than the United States has, Schneidman said. Still, \"the African market is so large,\" he said. \"There's such an opportunity there.\"\n\nThe real question now, he said, is: \"How do we get more U.S. companies into the continent?\"'"

The winner is expected to be chosen this spring.\n\nExperts do not agree over whether the United States needs a new bomber or not. Some say the new warplane is necessary to protect the country. Others call it a big waste of money. It could wind up being one of the most expensive planes the government ever built.\n\n\"You're talking about a $2 billion airplane by the time they build it,\" said Thomas Christie. He was an expert at the government's Department of Defense for more than 30 years. \"It's a disaster waiting to happen.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel is the head of the Defense Department. \"I think the Long-Range Strike Bomber is absolutely essential,\" he said last month.\n\n## Building Jobs Too\n\nAir Force officials say they need the new plane. It would be so secret when it flies that it would not show up on enemy radar. They said the stealth bomber would eventually be able to carry nuclear weapons. They also want to fly it with remote controls as a drone.\n\nOther details are a closely guarded secret.\n\nFor elected officials, however, the bomber means one thing. It means more jobs. They want to know what their state will get out of the deal.\n\nWorkers in the Palmdale, California, area have built many of the country's airplanes. The towns lost many jobs in the last few years as companies stopped making as many airplanes. The towns are struggling.\n\nThe project is secret. None of the airplane makers can talk about it, said Palmdale Mayor James Ledford. \"But we can.\"\n\nThe competing teams are led by Northrop Grumman and Boeing Company. If Northrop wins, it would build most of the bomber parts in Palmdale, Ledford said. It would bring about 1,500 jobs to the area.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation would work with Boeing. If that Boeing-Lockheed team wins, they would create about 700 jobs, Ledford said.\n\n\"It would be the answer to all our prayers,\" said R. Rex Parris, mayor of neighboring Lancaster, California. Many people in his town do not have jobs.\n\n## The Price Could Go Higher\n\nThe U.S. Air Force will make the final decision.\n\nThe military has promised not to spend more than $550 million per bomber. The Air Force plans to order as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring.\n\nBoeing, Northrup and Lockheed have all built planes for the government. They all ended up costing far more than expected.\n\nNorthrop developed the first B-2 stealth bomber. It was black and shaped like a boomerang. The original B-2 bomber cost so much to make that the government built just 21 of them. It originally wanted to build 132. Each one cost more than $2 billion.\n\nTodd Harrison is an expert on warplanes. He thinks the new stealth bomber program would actually cost $90 billion. That comes to about $900 million for each plane.\n\nCongress' staff members have often said the new bomber is not necessary. In 2013, they said the government should wait 10 years until technology improves.\n\nLancaster Mayor Parris really wants the bomber to be built. It would bring jobs to the area, including at restaurants, stores and other companies. From his point of view, jobs are what is important.\n\n\"It would be so great,\" Parris said, \"to see it all come back.\"'"

They want it to be on a label on the package.\n\nBut McCan's herd of roughly 4,000 includes cattle from Mexico. If the beef has to be labeled, he has to split up the animals when he sells them. There is no good reason for that, he said. It would just cost him and others millions of dollars more to handle the cattle. Those costs would get passed on. Beef would cost more at the grocery store.\n\n\"We don't want beef to become\" a very expensive item, said McCan. He comes from a long line of ranchers.\\n## \"We're Not Anti-Labeling\"\n\nMcCan is with a group that speaks for cattle producers. The ranchers and meat companies have sued the U.S. government about the new labeling rules. The rules would mean that the country where the cattle came from has to be included on beef packages.\n\nThe groups claim the labels will make it harder to sell beef outside the country. The rules are also unconstitutional, the producers and companies said.\n\nPeople who like the new rules say the labeling will not cost too much. They are ready to fight the cattle producers.\n\n\"Consumers have the right to know where products are from,\" said Joel Joseph. He is with the Made in the USA Foundation. That group is for labeling and products made in the United States. Saying where meat comes from on the label is the same as saying where a new car's engine comes from, he said.\n\nIf McCan does not want to have to split up his cattle, \"then he shouldn't get cattle from Mexico,\" he said.\n\nMcCan said whether the beef is labeled should be up to ranchers and meat companies.\n\n\"We're not anti-labeling at all,\" he said. But the government should not  be involved., he added.\\n## Canada May Fight Back\n\nCattle producers aren't the only unhappy ones.\n\nThe new labeling rules also could start a fight with Canada. The neighbor to the north is threatening to fight back.\n\nThe Canadian government said the new rules make it harder to sell things in the United States. It worries that it will sell less beef here.\n\nIt said it might make people in Canada pay more for products that come from America. It would do this by putting a tariff on things like pork, chocolate and a lot of other stuff from the United States. A tariff is a fee on something from outside of the country.\n\nCanada complained to the World Trade Organization. The WTO hears trade fights between countries.\n\nThe Agriculture Department is caught in the middle. Groups that favor labeling sued the department last year. They said the government was too slow to put the new rules in effect.\n\nConsumer groups say Americans want labeling. Nine of 10 people think packages should have to say where meat comes from, one pole said.\n\nMcCan is not convinced.\n\n\"They might say they care, but most of them really don't care what country it comes from. Beef is beef,\" he said.\\n## Mexican Cattle Clean And Healthy\n\nJohn Masswohl,  director of government and international relations for the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said consumers care more about price. The new rules would cost Canadian cattle producers $90 to $100 per animal, he said.\n\nThe new labels will say what countries the animals were born in, raised and killed.\n\nMcCan said he has sold cattle from Mexico for a long time. His ranch is just three hours from Mexico.\n\n\"They're clean animals and their health is good,\" he said. Cattle from Mexico is heavily tested and treated. \"If anything, they're even safer.\"\n\nBut Joseph said labeling is both a health and safety concern for Americans. They trust U.S. products more. His Made in the USA Foundation had urged the USDA to pass the new rules.\n\n\"You're getting a better product when you get American goods of any type,\" he said. U.S. food is safer and cleaner, he added.'"

Then the prices will be set using a private company, said Jeff Morales. He is in charge of the California High-Speed Rail Authority. His group is working on the train.\n\nCalifornians voted to have the train seven years ago. They decided to give a lot of state money to the train project.

The state law says the train has to be paid for with money from tickets. The people who run the train cannot ask the California government for extra money.\n\n## Cheaper Than Trains In Europe\n\nStill, the train will be cheap compared to train rides in Europe. It will also be cheaper than train rides in other parts of the United States.\n\nPeople looking to travel around California will have choices. They will look at how expensive train tickets are. They might choose to fly or drive.\n\nSome experts say it can be hard to say what people will do in 2028. If people do not ride the train, the state would have to keep giving the train more money.\n\nWhenever you try to predict things more than five years away, you are just guessing, said Lisa Schweitzer. She is a transportation expert. Things can change a lot in five years, she said.\n\n## Will Millions Of People Take The Train?\n\nThe train builders expect millions of passengers to ride the train each year. State officials say the cost to build the train will be paid off very quickly using money from passengers.\n\nSome outside experts are worried. The train will cost a lot to build. It will also cost a lot to run.\n\nWilliam Grindley is a business expert. He does not like the high-speed train project. Grindley said the system will lose money unless ticket prices go up a lot and many people ride the trains. He said the bullet train definitely will not make money.\n\nMorales said Grindley's opinion is wrong. He said outside experts have looked at the state's predictions. Those experts think the state is right about many people riding the bullet train, according to Morales.'"

It doesn't matter if there are lots of jobs, or unemployment. People everywhere are nervous about spending and investing. The fear of losing what they have is deeper than the wish to get more.\n\nAn Associated Press study shows that families in the 10 richest countries are spending carefully.

People's feelings about risk have changed.\n\n## Too Careful With Their Money?\n\nThe meaning of this is huge: Not owing money and spending less can be good for a family. But when hundreds of millions of people are too careful with their money, the entire world suffers. Spending creates a need for goods. That leads to more jobs and helps the economy. All the wealth in a country and everything it makes add up to the economy.\n\nA slow-growing economy means that salaries in the United States will not rise quickly. Right now, unemployment in parts of Europe is higher than ever. In several countries, more than a third of young people are out of work.\n\nThis means fewer people have extra money to spend. But even people with good jobs are being careful.\n\n\"It's safety, safety, safety,\" said Arne Holzhausen, an economist based in Munich.\n\nThe Associated Press studied what people did with their money five years before and after the crisis began. It focused on the world's 10 richest countries. They are: the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Russia, Italy and India.\n\n## Spending And Borrowing A Lot Less\n\nHere are the main points from the report:\n\n- RETREAT FROM STOCKS: People sold stocks and put their money into bonds, which are considered safer.\n\n- AVOIDING DEBT: The amount of money people owed increased a lot in the five years before the economic crisis. When the crisis hit, people stopped borrowing so freely. And they have been very slow to begin borrowing again, says Jack Ablin. He is a banker at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.\n\n- CASHING OUT: In the five years after the crisis, households in the six richest countries kept much more of their money in cash. People also put money into bank accounts. They earned little to no interest but felt safer.\n\n- SPENDING SLUMP: Being careful with money by cutting debt and saving more may be good in the long run. But this means people stop spending as much. After the crisis, people's rate of spending slowed down a lot.\n\n- DEVELOPING WORLD NOT HELPING ENOUGH: The richest countries have expected countries with growing economies to help global growth. Brazil, Russia, India and China recovered quickly from the crisis. But this year, their economies are hurting.\n\n## Hoarding Cash For 5 More Years\n\nPeople will begin spending money again. But few economists expect them to spend like they did before.\n\nExperts say the years before the crisis were not normal either. Families did not earn more. Instead, they borrowed too much money.\n\nMore importantly, economists say that people are \"scarred\" by the crisis. Scarring is the fear of losing money. It doesn't go away so quickly after the economy recovers.\n\nMany Americans suffered through the Great Depression in the 1930s. They remained careful about money even 20 or 30 years later. This was true even after the U.S. economy grew strong.\n\nNow, it may take a while before people begin spending normally again.  Some economists say it may take as many as five years.'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - China has had a law for many years that some people do not like. The law says many couples can have only one child. Now China is about to change the law.\n\nThe change is exciting for Luo Yuannan. She has a 2-year-old son and wants another child. Luo is hoping for a girl. So are many other modern women in China who have one son.\n\n\"I was amazed,\" said Luo. \"I always wanted to have a second child and now I will get the chance.\"\n\nSoon there might be lots of new babies in China. The Chinese Communist Party controls the government in the country. On Friday, it said it was changing the one-child law. Now, if one parent is an only child, the couple will be allowed to have a second baby. Before, both parents needed to be only children to have a second baby.\n\n## \"This Is Much Better\"\n\nPopulation experts believe about 10 million couples will be affected by the change in the law. Luo and her husband are one of those couples. She is an only child, but he is not.\n\nStill, population experts are not expecting a huge baby boom.\n\nRight now, around 16 million babies are born in China each year. Population expert Wang Feng expects that number to only go up by 1 to 2 million. He has studied a group of couples who are already allowed to have two children. No more than half chose to have a second child.\n\n\"I am so busy with one child. I can't imagine taking care of two children,\" said Feng Zhilan as she came out of a children's hospital with her son. \"And I'm spending about $490 to $655 a month on him for kindergarten, clothes, activities. It is not possible.\"\n\nZhao Mei said she and her husband had already been planning to have a second child. But they were figuring they would have to save up a lot of money first. The money would have gone to paying the fine for having a second baby without permission. The fines can run as high as $50,000.\n\n\"Now it's legal,\" she said. \"This is much better.\"\n\n## An Unpopular Law\n\nThe one-child law was introduced in 1979. It was meant to lower population growth in a nation that now has 1.3 billion people. The Communist Party has allowed couples to have two children in a lot of special cases. But the law hasn't changed much for years.\n\nThere are 1.18 babies born for each woman in China now. This is considered too low.\n\nThe one-child rule has been very unpopular. It may be the most unpopular law in the country.\n\nZhang Yansheng is an important member of the Communist Party. He remembers his daughter's loneliness as a young girl. She grew up as an only child in a big apartment building. There were few other children around for her to play with.\n\n\"I feel we could have provided her with a better life,\" he said.  The one-child law had to be changed for the good of China, Zhang said.'"

            "text": "\tDILLINGHAM, Alaska - People in this fishing village in southwestern Alaska say they have a big problem. A company wants to build a giant mine in their region. They say it will kill fish and destroy their way of life. They spoke with President Barack Obama's top environmental official about their worries.\n\nGina McCarthy became head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last month. She said the residents' words moved her. They reminded her of what the EPA works for every day.\n\n\"I intend to make you proud in the position the president has given me,\" she said. She gave the speech in a packed gymnasium at a Dillingham school. The crowd stood up and clapped.\n\nMcCarthy visited the Bristol Bay area this week. Her visit took place as people across the country discuss the project. It could be the largest open-pit mine in North America. The problem for many? It's in a region that is home to half the world's wild red salmon.\n\n## An Area Of Lakes And Streams\n\nSupporters of the mine project say it will create new jobs. Those against the mine say it will destroy streams, wetlands and salmon. Many Dillingham residents are against the mine. But they were encouraged after McCarthy's visit. They felt she was sympathetic to their views.\n\n\"It was like a shot to the heart when she said, 'I'm going to make you proud,''' said Robyn Chaney of Dillingham. \"It gives you a glimmer of hope.\"\n\nPebble Partnership is the name of the company that wants to build the mine. It has not filed for permission to start the work. The EPA may use the Clean Water Act to block the company before it applies for permission. The Act protects against water pollution.\n\nThe area of the mine is full of lakes and streams. The sweeping land is surrounded by mountains. Moose, caribou and grizzly bears roam here.\n\nA tiny camp dots the Alaskan wilderness. So far, it is the only sign of the mine project.\n\n## A Huge Supply Of Copper And Gold\n\nThe Pebble Partnership says the region's supply of minerals is huge. It is one of the largest of its kind on the planet. The mine could produce about 80 billion pounds of copper and 107 million ounces of gold over 30 years.\n\nThe mine site is near Iliamna. The tiny village is home to about 100 people clustered around a huge lake. The community is quiet even in summer. There's little activity, aside from Pebble Partnership testing the ground. The company hopes the mine will bring in a lot of money.\n\nPebble workers came to meet McCarthy in Iliamna. They wore safety vests with \"zero harm\" printed on them. The workers said the mine will be good for the area. The company will hire people from Iliamna and surrounding villages. Jobs range from helping out in the kitchen to guarding workers from bears.\n\n\"There are no other job opportunities, absolutely none,\" said Janessa Woods. She said that without Pebble Partnership, she couldn't support her family.\n\nIn Dillingham, everyone who spoke to McCarthy was against the Pebble mine. The town of about 2,300 lives and breathes salmon. Worn-down buildings display bright murals. The paintings celebrate salmon and urge the fish's preservation.\n\n## A Way Of Life In The Balance\n\n\"We are people of fish, we are people of salmon, that is what we depend on,\" said Tom Tilden. He is the Curyung Tribal Chief. Curyung is the Yupik Indian name for Dillingham.\n\n\"We want this renewable resource to come back year after year after year so we can continue to be here,\" he said.\n\nThe EPA leader toured the mine site with Pebble officials after leaving Dillingham. John Shively heads Pebble Partnership. He told McCarthy the company has good intentions. Developers want to build a mine that will bring more wealth to the region while protecting the environment, he said.\n\nThe EPA said in April the mine could wipe out nearly 100 miles of stream in the region. It could destroy 4,800 acres of wetlands.'"

            "text": "\tFORT CHIPEWYAN, Canada - The Athabasca River flows through forests of spruce and birch trees. In the Cree Indian language, \"athabasca\" means \"a place where grass is everywhere.\"\n\nA hundred miles upstream, the forest is being destroyed. Shovels pick up 200,000 pounds of earth at a time. Then they dump it into yellow trucks as big as houses.\n\nThe sandy dirt contains a fortune in oil.\n\nOil sands can be turned into fuel to power cars and trucks. It's a natural resource that has brought a lot of money here. Oil companies employ people in places where there are not a lot of  jobs to mine the sands. But the mining may be polluting the area. It also may be hurting the health of people who live nearby.\n\nThe Native Indians of Alberta have a hard decision.\n\nTheir thinking seems to be: \"'It's a choice between whether we starve to death or are poisoned to death,'\" said John O'Connor. He is a local doctor.\n\nAfter the sands are mined, the leftover material is stored nearby in poisonous ponds. Air cannons keep birds from landing.\n\n## Studies Show Mines Not Healthy\n\nIn the U.S., people wonder if oil sands mining is involved in [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). Here the issue is more complicated.\n\nIn Fort Chipewyan, diseases have struck the mainly Cree, Dene and Metis nations. Cancer rates have been a third higher than normal.\n\nThree weeks ago, high levels of mercury were found in birds' eggs. Mercury is poisonous. Fishermen say some fish have  bulging eyes and other strange problems.\n\nThree different studies show rising level of chemicals in nearby waterways. Some cause cancer. Alberta officials say the chemicals are there naturally. They insist they are protecting the native communities.\n\nNatives Indians have hunted and fished here for thousands of years. They are known as First Nations.\n\nNo other country sells more oil to the U.S. than Canada. Most of the oil come from oil sands. Officials hope oil production will be about 5 million barrels a day by 2030. About 1.9 million barrels are produced now. Many of the world's biggest oil companies mine the oil sands along the Athabasca River.\n\nThere will likely be more mining if the United States approves the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The pipeline would bring the oil from Alberta to the U.S. It will be be made into gasoline. Some local people fear the pipeline would cause more pollution.\n\nA 2013 study on lakes near the mines showed pollution levels were getting worse, said Joshua Kurek. He helped write the study.\n\nThe government says oil companies must obey environmental rules. Over 16 years, there were 4,000 possible violations. Alberta took action in just 37 cases, a report showed.\n\n## Good And Bad\n\nYet, jobs are scarce. And some native groups have made their peace with oil sands mining.\n\nFor years, the village at Fort MacKay fought every oil sands project. It lost each time. By the 1990s, it began to work with the industry.\n\n\"It's like sleeping next to a huge elephant,\" said Jim Boucher. He is chief of Fort McKay First Nation. \"At the end of the day, we have to make the best of it.\"\n\nFort MacKay smells of the mines when the wind blows from the south. But the village has gained millions of dollars from the oil sands mining. It is building a new youth center, church and theater. Homes are going up in nearby hills. Villagers drive expensive cars.\n\nIn Fort Chipewyan, a youth center is named for an oil company. Villagers fear the mining. But they feel they can't stop it.\n\nAlice Rigney wonders if her breast cancer was related to mining. She would like to see the waste ponds cleaned up. But she's also realistic: The money paid by the oil company is too good to turn down.\n\n\"I don't think we can win. I don't even know what winning looks like,\" said Rigney. She teaches the Dene language. \"This oil is just too important for the rest of Canada.\"'"

            "text": "\tQINGDAO, China - There's one easy way to make the beach even better for Li Lejun. Just add seaweed. Hundreds and hundreds of tons of it.\n\nLi's back was covered in what looked like strands of bright yellow cotton candy. The 7-year-old boy from Beijing was having the time of his life. His legs were buried in the sand on the beach covered by seaweed.\n\nMen nearby were using pitchforks to throw seaweed into a yellow front-end loader. In the other direction, a backhoe was scooping it into dump trucks. On Saturday, Lejun and his 69-year-old grandpa had helped gather it from the sea.\n\n\"It's really fun to play with!\" Lejun said. \"It's very soft and fun to touch.\"\n\n## Tons Of The Stuff\n\nSeaweed has grown in the waters of this city like a bright green carpet. This is at least the sixth year in a row. This year the seaweed was grew to about 11,500 square miles. The state of Massachusetts not as large. Some beaches are buried under 16 inches of the flossy plant.\n\nThe seaweed started to show up a month ago. Officials have sent 2,440 people to try to keep up with the plant. Every year, it turns Qingdao's shoreline into something more like a lawn.\n\nA lifeguard said on the worst days he has 100 men arrive by 3 a.m. They clear the water and the shore using boats, nets and trucks.\n\n\"On a heavy day, we can load up 15 trucks,\" he said. \"Sometimes we get 150 or even 160 tons in a day.\"\n\nThe algae is called hutai in China. It grows wild in summer when days are longer and the sun is high in the sky. High levels of chemicals in the water can kickstart the growth.\n\n## Harvesting It For Food\n\nTim Nelson is a seaweed expert at Seattle Pacific University. He said those chemicals might get stirred up from deeper in the ocean. Or they could be brought by dirt from farms, golf courses and gardens washing into the sea. But once the seaweed starts growing, it's hard to stop it.\n\nIn general, the plant isn't dangerous. Brave people have been playing in the green seas. They lay on soft-looking green beds of the seaweed on shore. They are even burying themselves in big green piles of the stuff. Qingdao is living up to its name, which means \"Green Island.\"\n\nLocal leaders are sending the seaweed off to factories. The water gets sucked out and the material is dried. They make it into animal feed or fertilizer. Some of it becomes a medical supplement known as hutai sugar.\n\nNetizens in China have tried to think of other uses for all the seaweed. One user of the microblog Weibo shared a recipe for a hutai dish that looked like guacamole. In southern China, hutai is enjoyed as a food. It sells for about $6 a pound dried. It can be fried with peanuts or shrimp. Some people mix it into spring rolls or pancakes.\n\n## Clearing It Quickly\n\nBut Qingdao isn't the only place that's had \"green tides.\" Seaweed blankets have been reported in Puget Sound, Wash.; Rhode Island, England and France.\n\nThe seaweed can rot and give off poison fumes. A man riding his horse along the coast in France came across huge piles of it. Both he and the horse fainted, and the horse died.\n\nLarge mats of seaweed can also be dangerous to sea plants and animals. They can steal oxygen from patches of ocean.\n\nConditions for seaweed growth are best at about 68 degrees. Once temperatures rise to about 73, the seaweed will sink or begin to die off naturally.\n\n## Reporting For Pitchfork Duty\n\nUntil then, Dong Ji-sheng will keep showing up for pitchfork duty at 4:30 a.m. at No. 1 Bathing Beach.\n\n\"There's more this year than last year. It must have something to do with the changing climate,\" he said. \"It's a natural disaster.\"\n\nWu Chengyao is a Chinese teacher visiting Qingdao. He said he's enjoying the hutai while it lasts.\n\n\"I long for the sea,\" he said Sunday. He buried his feet into a soft mound of the seaweed on the shore. Gentle waves covered his ankles. \"This won't discourage me at all.\"'"

            "text": "b\"Imagine a squid or a fish swimming in the ocean of another planet. What would these sea animals swim like? A new study says they would probably move a lot like they do on Earth.\n\nThe study looked at the way different sea animals move through water. Scientists found that their swim strokes have the same pattern. The scientists believe this happens because of evolution. They think two different species might grow and change because of their environment. If they have similar environments, they will change in similar ways.\n\nThere are different kinds of swimmers. For example, the bony cuttlefish is very different from the squid, but they swim in similar ways. The study could also help engineers build better swimming robots.\n\n## Knifefish Makes Waves\n\nA team of scientists was studying the black ghost knifefish. The black ghost knifefish lives in streams in South America. It has a fin that runs along most of its body. It swims by moving the fin under its body like a wave.\n\nThe knifefish moves differently than fish like trout or salmon. Trout sweep their tail and the back part of their bodies back and forth. The knifefish moves by creating a wave that moves down its one thin fin.\n\nThe scientists began to wonder about the rules of movement for fish.\n\nSea creatures who move like the fish are called fin swimmers. Some creatures have one fin like the black ghost knifefish. Their fin runs along the length of their bodies. Other animals have a pair of fins. They have one on each side.\n\n## Different Fish, Same Swim Rules\n\nThe scientists studied the way the knifefish moved. Two waves moved along the length of its fin. The waves allowed the fish to move forward fast. The scientists wanted to find out if there was a common rule of movement for different animals.\n\nThey studied 22 sea animals with fins. The fish were all very different from each other.\n\nThe scientists wanted to find what was the same among the fish.\n\nThey found that all the animals follow the same rules when they swim. Every full back-and-forth wave of the fish's fin was 20 times as long as the wiggle was wide. The scientists studied skates and rays. They looked at black ghost knifefish and the cuttlefish. That fraction remained the same. It was always 20 to 1.\n\n## Maybe Robots Will Swim Like Fish\n\nThis way of moving has shown up over and over again in different animals for thousands of years. The scientists think this is because this method works best. It lets sea creatures swim faster and better.\n\nIf alien fish were found on another planet, they would move in similar ways, said Malcolm MacIver. He is a scientist at Northwestern University. He wrote the study with another scientist.\n\nThe study could help scientists build underwater robots. They hope to make robots move more like fish.\""

            "text": "\tNaegleria fowleri is a tiny living being. It lives in warm lakes and rivers. Scientists call it N. fowleri. Other people may call it a brain-eating amoeba. It can cause a very rare, deadly disease. It eats brains.\n\nNine-year-old Hally Yust died from the illness recently. The amoeba got into her body while she was swimming.\n\nN. fowleri is a type of amoeba. This particular amoeba makes the brain swell. The infection kills almost everybody N. fowleri attacks. The victims die within days.\n\n## Infections Are Not Common\n\nNot many people get the infection. Only 34 were reported in the United States during the past 10 years. That number might be increasing. Before 2010, more than half of the cases came from Southern states. Since then, infections have turned up as far north as Minnesota.\n\n\"We're seeing it in states where we hadn't seen cases before,\" says Jennifer Cope. She is an expert in amoeba infections at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC is in charge of protecting America's health and safety.\n\nThe infections could be moving to other places because of climate change, Cope said. N. fowleri thrives in warmer temperatures.\n\nCope says we do not know a lot about the amoeba. We do not know why it chooses its victims. The body has defenses against diseases. These defenses are called the immune system. But the amoeba has been able to slip past the immune system.\n\nThere also are not a lot of ways to treat the infections. One reason is the illness moves quickly.\n\nBut the infection can be stopped if it is caught soon enough.\n\n## The Amoeba Is A Fast Traveler\n\nWhat happens during an N. fowleri infection?\n\nThe amoeba enters the body when water goes up the nose. It sticks to the mucous membranes. Those membranes are the slimy stuff inside your nose. Then the N. fowleri digs into the olfactory nerve. That nerve is what lets us smell things. The nerve also leads directly to the brain.\n\nPeople who get infections usually have been doing something that forces a lot of water up the nose. Some of those activities include diving and waterskiing. One case happened during a baptism dunking.\n\nThe amoeba moves to the front of the brain. There, it eats some of the brain. The destruction of that part of the brain causes loss of smell and taste. Those are the symptoms, or signs of disease. They show up about five days after the infection sets in.\n\nFrom there, the amoeba travels to the rest of the brain. First, it gobbles up the protective covering that surrounds the central nervous system. When the body notices that something is wrong, it sends cells to fight the infection. This causes the surrounding area to become swollen. The swelling leads to headaches, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck.\n\n## Infection Risk Is Small, But Deadly\n\nThe amoeba eats more tissue. It moves deeper into the brain. Then the next symptoms set in. They include confusion, seeing things that are not there, and uncontrollable muscle movements.\n\nIn the end, the swelling in the skull causes a lot of pressure. The pressure forces the brain down into where the brain stem meets the spinal cord. The connection between the two breaks. Then people stop breathing. Most patients die less than two weeks after the symptoms began.\n\nThe threat of getting an N. fowleri infection is small. In fact, many more people die every year from drowning. You can do some things to lower the risk even more. Cope recommends using nose plugs and not putting your head fully under water when swimming. She also says not to kick up mud in the water, which can shake the amoeba loose.\n\nBetter treatments may be on the horizon. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Miltefosine, a drug first invented as an anti-cancer treatment. In 2013, two people in the United States survived N. fowleri when they took drugs, including Miltefosine, soon after being infected.'"

            "text": "\tBALTIMORE -Frogs and toads and salamanders are disappearing fast in the United States, a study says.\n\nFrogs, toads and salamanders are all amphibians. They spend part of the time on land and part of the time in water.\n\nScientists who ran the study say they are finding amphibians in fewer places than previously thought. The animals are also disappearing faster than the scientists expected.\n\nThey are vanishing from ponds, streams and other areas in national parks and wildlife refuges. Animals are supposed to be safe in these places.\n\n\"What we found was a little surprising,\" said Evan Grant. He is a government scientist.\n\nIf this keeps up, some of the rarer amphibians could vanish from half their homes in six years. Even the more common ones could be gone from half their homes in 26 years.\n\nScientists knew that some frogs and toads were in trouble. But now they can see how fast they are disappearing across the country.\n\nFrogs and their relatives are important in nature. They eat mosquitoes and other insects. They are also cold-blooded. That means they need the sun's warmth to stay active. They breathe through their skin. So they can tell if the water changes.\n\n## Hiding Under Rocks\n\nIt is hard to see the animals' behavior because they tend to hide in the water or under rocks,  Joel Snodgrass, a biology professor, said. The new study helped fix this problem. Scientists looked at lots of places. They did this for nine years. They were surprised by what they found. They did not expect to see so many common amphibians disappearing.\n\nThis is bad news. If things keep going this way, you may not be able to find a frog or toad in half the places you used to by the time you are in your mid-20s.\n\nThe scientists did not try say why the critters were disappearing.  Disease, chemicals and climate change have been blamed in the past.\n\nParts of the nation had very little snow or rain while the study was going on. That might have meant that there was less water in the wetlands and ponds where amphibians live.\n\n## Salt-Free Frogs, Please\n\nSalamanders are amphibians that look like slimy lizards. Some of them feel changes to water or the land more than others. Quite a few of these more sensitive salamanders have disappeared. When cities and suburbs get bigger, you lose some salamanders, said Mark Southerland. You probably lose some frogs too, he said. Southerland is an ecologist who studies living things and where they live.\n\nFrogs and their friends in and around cities might be hurt by winter weather. Or at least how cities deal with that weather. That is because cities use rock salt to melt ice and snow on their roads, Snodgrass said.\n\nSalamanders and frogs eat insects that live in fresh water. The road salt can kill those insects. The salt also hurts amphibians more directly. Because they breathe through their skin, if there is more salt in the water, the animals lose fluid in their bodies.\n\n\"Basically, they die of thirst\" even in the water, Snodgrass said.'"

            "text": "\tOur whole planet is warming, but the Arctic is warming much faster. The area near the North Pole is getting hotter twice as fast as the rest of the planet.\n\nThe Arctic is mostly covered with ice called permafrost. Today, the permafrost is melting. Scientists are discovering strange things: ice that burns, slow-moving mudslides, tilting trees, and mysterious craters.\n\nCraters have been found in Russia. These bowl-shaped holes in the ground are deep and wide. Scientists are not sure what caused them. Methane gas was trapped underground for hundreds of years. Scientists think that when ice melted, the methane burst out.\n\nThe melting ice is causing huge changes in the Arctic. Some of the changes may lead to even more warming.\n\nCraters can become lakes. Lakes warm the land around them because their water traps heat from the sun.\n\n## Fire Over The Ice\n\nLakes and the land nearby are home to microbes. Microbes are tiny organisms like bacteria. They eat dead plants that have thawed and change them into methane gas. An area with a lot of methane gas can be lit on fire. Flames can dance on the ice.\n\nAlong with craters, scientists have seen trees leaning over. As Arctic ice melts, hard soil becomes mud. The trees begin to lean.\n\nWhole forests are now leaning to one side. They are nicknamed \"drunken trees.\"\n\nThe mud can also damage roads and buildings after they sink into the mud.\n\nOn steep ground, the melting ice causes slumps. The slumps are like slow-moving mudslides. Some slumps are huge and are a serious problem. These \"megaslumps\" are moving through the land and show no signs of stopping.\n\nOne enormous slump in Russia has been growing since the 1970s, says scientist Guido Grosse.\n\n## More Greenhouse Gas\n\nMaybe the biggest worry in the Arctic is a sudden release of methane gas.\n\nMethane traps heat in our atmosphere and causes the earth to warm. It is a greenhouse gas. Methane traps eight times more heat than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most common greenhouse gas.\n\nThe thawing in the Arctic will also release carbon dioxide. The more greenhouse gases the Arctic releases, the faster it will warm. Humans also cause CO2 by burning fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas.\n\nThe thawing will also uncover dead plants. Microbes will eat the plants. Then they will release CO2, which may cause even more warming.\n\nThe permafrost can never refreeze, says scientist Kevin Schaefer. Thawing could go on for hundreds of years.\n\n## Scientists Are Worried\n\nTwice as much carbon lies below the Arctic soil as there is in the atmosphere. As carbon gets released, it could raise the Earth's temperature.\n\nIn the past, scientists thought the Arctic would thaw slowly. Now they are not so sure.\n\nSigns of thawing like the slumps are happening faster than expected.\n\nIt is difficult to know how quickly the Arctic will thaw. The meltdown could speed up and happen in decades. It could slow down and thaw over centuries.\n\nScientists say Arctic thawing needs more study. Because of the huge area and tough conditions, that has been difficult.\n\nScientists do know one thing: humans have hurt the Arctic.\n\n\"The faster you burn fossil fuels, the faster the Arctic is going to warm,\" Schaefer said.'"

            "text": "\tIn the coldest parts of the ocean, near the North and South Poles, the water is full of ice. Some pieces of ice are huge, like floating islands.\n\nThings are changing in these parts of the world. Temperatures have gotten hotter. As a result, a lot of the ice has melted.\n\nScientists have discovered another change. These northern waters are now full of huge waves.\n\n## Accidental Discovery\n\nThe discovery was an accident. In 2010, scientist Aleksey Marchenko set out on a trip. He and his students wanted to study the icy waters.\n\nMarchenko's ship had to make its way through the ice slowly. They made it to the parts of the ocean where the ice was thick. Marchenko stopped the boat near a large piece of ice. He and his students were about to explore it. Marchenko decided to check it out first.\n\nThen Marchenko noticed something. \"I discovered many cracks around,\" he remembers.\n\nHe decided to move the ship deeper into the ice for safety. They saw small waves, and then bigger ones. Soon, the waves broke up the ice around the ship into thousands of smaller pieces.\n\n## Big Waves, Icy Waters\n\nWithin an hour, Marchenko and his team started seeing huge waves. They recorded waves that were more than 20 feet tall. They were the largest ever measured in icy waters.\n\nMarchenko remembers seeing even bigger waves in the distance. He says they were 30 feet high, or more.\n\nMarchenko then gave his measurements to a man named Clarence Collins. Collins worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). He looked at Marchenko's measurements to try to figure out how the waves got to be so big.\n\nCollins found that the ice could not stop the waves. The waves were so strong that they lifted up huge pieces of ice and rolled on under them.\n\n## Breaking Up The Ice\n\nAs the ice bounced up and down, it started to break into smaller pieces. This made it even easier for the waves to pass through.\n\nThe ice was broken up within just one hour. Collins figured that waves were destroying more than 10 miles of ice an hour.\n\nScientists had never imagined that waves could break up ice so quickly. The waves in these areas used to be small. So much of the oceans were covered with ice that there was little open space left where storms could whip up big waves\n\n## Warmer Water Makes Big Waves\n\nThings have changed, however. Temperatures have gone up. This causes ice to melt. It also causes more storms. Now, when there are storms over the water, waves have room to build up. Then they crash into the ice, breaking it up and clearing even more open space.\n\nThe large waves make these waters more dangerous. The speed of the waves makes it impossible to know when they'll come. This could make it dangerous to humans to be there. Wildlife like polar bears and walruses that live on the ice are also in danger.\n\nCollins thinks soon scientists will soon see even bigger waves in these icy waters. As waves break up ice, the seas will become more open, and the waves will get even stronger. There are stormy times ahead.'"

            "text": "\tScientists found the remains of a giant sea creature.\n\nIts name is Aegirocassis benmoulae. The creature lived about 480 million years ago. It swam in a shallow sea that is now the Sahara Desert in Africa. It grew up to 7 feet long. At the time, it was one of the largest creatures on Earth.\n\nScientists say the Aegirocassis benmoulae is an early member of the arthropod family. Arthopods are animals with skeletons outside of their bodies, like shells. Modern arthropods include lobsters, cockroaches and butterflies. The sea creature was their ancient ancestor.\n\n## Ate Like A Whale\n\n\"It is one of the biggest arthropods that ever existed, far bigger than any arthropod today,\" said Peter Van Roy. He is a paleontologist at Yale University who helped find the sea creature. Paleontologists study fossils of ancient creatures. They want to see how they changed over time. A fossil can be an old bone or a shell. It can even be an imprint of an animal on a rock.\n\nA report describing the sea creature was published Wednesday in Nature magazine.\n\nMost of the major groups of animals appeared on Earth about the same time. This sea creature lived far earlier than the first dinosaurs. It was the largest animal of its time. It died out long ago.\n\nThe sea creature belonged to a group of animals that had flat bodies and lived in water. All of them had two growths in the front of their mouths. They were mostly used to grab prey, like worms. However, the newly discovered sea creature looked differently. In front of its mouth, it had a net of spikes. The creature used the spikes to catch tiny sea animals called plankton. It ate like a whale.\n\n## \"We Found So Many\"\n\nThe sea creature seems to have been fairly common. It was named in honor of Moroccan fossil collector Mohamed Ben Moula, who found it in Morocco with Van Roy. Morocco is a country in North Africa. The two scientists found dozens of the fossils in the Moroccan desert.\n\n\"It is interesting we found so many of them,\" Van Roy said.\n\nArthropods first showed up about 530 million years ago. Today, arthropods include the largest number of different animals on the planet. There are so many of them because they can live in so many different kinds of environments.\n\nHowever, early arthropod fossils are hard to find. That makes this find so exciting for scientists.\n\nMost fossils are the remains of the hard parts of an animal, like shells and bone, explained John Paterson. He teaches at the University of New England in Australia.\n\n## Getting A Clue\n\nThe sea creature fossils are from the soft part of the animal. Finding this is very rare. Usually scientists find shell or bone fossils.\n\nThe sea creature fossils are in very good condition. They were preserved in mud that flowed into the bottom of the sea. The mud turned the sea creature to stone.\n\nThis helped scientists solve an old mystery.\n\nToday, the legs of most arthropods have two parts. Scientists have wondered how they got that way. The sea creature fossils have given them a clue.\n\nVan Roy said they found many fossils in the Moroccan desert.\n\n\"We have something like 5,000 or 6,000 specimens,\" he said. Most of them have not been studied yet.'"

            "text": "\tCARMEL VALLEY, Calif. - The Santa Lucia Mountains rise high along California's coast. They should have some of the country's cleanest air. However, scientist Ian Faloona is finding high levels of pollution there. He says it is blowing across the Pacific Ocean from Asia.\n\nFaloona has been measuring ozone pollution. Ozone is the gas in smog. Smog is air pollution. It can damage people's lungs. For three years, Faloona has been studying the ozone as it reaches California.\n\n## Breathing Problems\n\nHis measuring instruments are located on Chews Ridge in the Santa Lucia Mountains. The spot is more than 5,000 feet above sea level. There he can test the air blowing in from across the Pacific.\n\nOzone pollution is caused by cars, trucks and factories. It leads to breathing problems. It can cause heart disease and even early death.\n\nFaloona says U.S. ozone levels are rising. The problem is particularly bad in the western United States.\n\nThe rise in ozone levels was not supposed to happen. Pollution from cars and factories has been cut steeply across the U.S.\n\n## Across The Pacific Ocean\n\nScientists like Faloona believe they know what is going on. They say pollution in China and other Asian countries is causing U.S. ozone levels to go up.\n\nFactories in China are very busy these days. More and more people in China are driving cars. The result is increasing ozone pollution there.\n\nWinds carry the ozone from China to the U.S. It only takes about a week for the gas to be blown across the Pacific. The ozone then adds to pollution created by American cars and factories.\n\nWestern states are more affected by the problem. They are closer to the Pacific Ocean, so the ozone reaches them first. Smog has become much worse in California's cities like Bakersfield, Fresno and Los Angeles.\n\n## Fighting Pollution\n\nIt will not be easy to stop pollution from China, said scientist Owen Cooper. The U.S. and China would have to work out a deal. A deal between two countries is called a treaty.\n\nSuch an agreement is not likely, said Cooper. The U.S. will have to work harder at stopping the pollution here. Pollution from U.S. cars and factories will have to be cut more.\n\nEven if pollution from cars and factories is cut, it will be tough to make a difference. In Denver, cars cause much less pollution than they used to. Still, Denver's \"ozone pollution isn't coming down. It's kind of stuck,\" Cooper said.\n\n## \"It's All Connected\"\n\nIn the past, pollution in China did not use to worry the U.S. much. Now, people realize that smog in a faraway country can reach us here.\n\nPollution in China and pollution in the U.S. are connected, Faloona says.\n\nFrom his site on high at Chews Ridge, he looks west. He sees ozone blowing in across the Pacific Ocean. Looking inland, he sees grey smog over the San Joaquin Valley. The area is covered by a cloud of air pollution.\n\nPeople used to think Chinese pollution would not reach us here, Faloona said. They did not believe it could travel all the way across the Pacific. However, \"we've realized it's all connected.\"'"

            "text": "\tHACKENSACK, N.J. - Little brown bats in New Jersey have been dying from an illness. It is called \"white nose.\" The illness gets its name because a white powder grows on bats' noses, ears and wings.\n\nWhite nose is caused by a fungus. It grows in bat caves.\n\nThe bats become infected while sleeping for the winter. Bats sleep all winter long and wake up in the spring. It is known as hibernation. They do not eat the whole time. They eat as much as they can before they hibernate. It helps them store fat for the winter.\n\nWhite nose causes the bats to move around during hibernation. Moving around makes them lose weight. Because they don't eat in hibernation, many little brown bats die of hunger before spring arrives.\n\nThey are dying very fast.\n\n## One Baby Bat A Year Is Not Enough\n\nNine out of every 10 little brown bats have died since 2008. Back then, about 30,000 in New Jersey hibernated each year. Now there are only a few hundred. Scientists say there are so few left, that all little brown bats might die out.\n\nLittle brown bat mothers only give birth to one baby a year. It is not enough. They are dying faster than they are being born.\n\nNot all bats are dying. Big brown bats are another type, or species, of bat. Their numbers are actually going up.\n\nBig brown bats get white nose too, but it does not kill them.\n\nTheir bodies are bigger and hold more food for the winter. They still move around but do not go hungry. They also hibernate for less time than little brown bats. While hibernating, they sleep far apart, so the disease does not spread from bat to bat easily. And big brown bat mothers have two babies a year.\n\n## Bats Help Humans In Many Ways\n\nBut other types of bats are dying. Scientists say white nose is killing bats across the country. It is now found in 25 states. Millions have died.\n\nIt is not just a problem for bats. People need bats. They eat insects that eat vegetables and fruit that people grow. If there aren't enough bats to eat bugs, then farmers might grow less food. Bats also eat mosquitoes, which carry diseases that can make people sick.\n\nScientists across the country are trying to find a way to save little brown bats. Some are looking at bacteria. They are the simplest of creatures that are considered alive. Bacteria are everywhere, even inside of you. Some bacteria causes disease, but some is good for us. They help humans digest food in our guts. Bacteria could fight the fungus that's hurting the bats.\n\n## Looking For A Cure\n\nOther scientists are studying another fungus. It might be stronger than the white nose fungus. It also would not kill any bats.\n\nJeremy Coleman works for the government. He is in charge of trying to stop white nose. He says no scientists have given the treatments to bats yet. Spraying caves with the treatments could help the bats. Yet other animals in the caves might get hurt.\n\nColeman says even if the treatments work there will be fewer bats for a long time. It could take hundreds of years for the numbers of little brown bats to come back as before.'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - Bears have been in the news this year. But nowhere more than in Maine. Voters there face a question on Nov. 4. They have a bear problem to solve.\n\nLike other states, they want to keep their bear population low. Hunting is one way of doing that. At the same time, animal rights groups are trying to stop certain ways of hunting. Maine is the only state other than Alaska where hunters can kill bears with bait, traps and dogs.\n\nVoters are being asked if these ways of hunting should be banned. A ban would stop them in almost every case. They would only be allowed to protect property, people's safety, or to study bears.\n\n\"The fact is, you don't need to use these methods to hunt the animals,\" said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. His group wants to change the hunting rules. \"Hunting is supposed to give the animals a chance.\"\n\nPacelle is working with a group called Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting. They are leading the fight to change the hunting rules.\n\n## Bears Could Lose Their Snacks\n\nOn the other side is a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt. It is fighting to keep the old ways of hunting. The group has a lot of supporters. Maine's wildlife department even supports it. It says that Maine has more than 30,000 black bears.\n\n\"We have one of the largest bear populations in the country, certainly on the East Coast,\" said James Cody. He helps run Save Maine's Bear Hunt. Cody said nearly all of the kills in last year's bear hunt would become illegal. They all used ways of hunting that would be banned.\n\nState wildlife officials said that bait was used most often. It was used in nearly three out of four kills. The bait is usually buckets filled with junk food and sweets.\n\nGetting rid of these ways of hunting would increase the number of bears. It would also hurt businesses that make money from hunting.\n\n## Bears Make The News\n\nAlso fighting against changes to the hunting rules are the National Rifle Association and Governor Paul LePage.\n\nGroups that want hunting rules kept could have the news on their side. There have been recent bear attacks in states with large numbers of bears. The most well-known of these happened last month in New Jersey. A 22-year-old hiker there was attacked and killed by a black bear.\n\nOfficials killed the bear. A police report described it as a large male weighing 250-300 pounds.\n\nAlso last month, a Santa Barbara County, California, woman fought off a black bear. It attacked her while she was out walking her dogs.\n\n## It's A Big Problem\n\nThe problem in Maine is a national problem. The number of black bears has increased in many states. The increases are due to efforts to protect the bears. At the same time, more bears and humans are living near each other in some areas.\n\nIn Ridgewood, New Jersey, police last month captured a black bear. It was wandering near a school. Wildlife officials there say bear sightings have gone up by almost one-quarter from last year. The bear captured in Ridgewood was let go back into the wild. It had climbed a tree and was shot with a tranquilizer gun.\n\nSurveys show more people in Maine plan to vote \"no\" in November. They do not want the hunting rules changed. But the \"yes\" side is still hopeful.'"

And that made for fun Facebook posts and interesting talk.\n\nNo one had been badly hurt yet because of a bear. Experts told people that the bears would leave them alone. They just had to follow some simple rules.\n\nBut all of that changed on Dec. 2. Susan Chalfant, 54, was hurt badly while walking her two small dogs. It was the most serious bear attack in Florida's history.\n\n## People Want More Protection\n\nSince the attack, people who live where bears roam say they are scared. They don't think the state is doing enough to protect them.\n\nDavid Simmons is in Florida's government. He said the bears are showing up where people have been living for a long time. He said it's not that people are moving into places where bears live. Bears are now moving to where people live. And that's causing problems.\n\nNick Wiley is in charge of the Florida's wildlife agency. He said his workers have done a lot to protect people.\n\nHe said his workers will kill a bear if it is not scared of people and trying to stay away from them. They don't like doing it, but \"people come first,\" he said.\n\nThe agency plans to get more workers to trap bears. Then they can be moved to other places. Or the workers will catch and kill the bears. They are also asking people to make changes, like keeping their garbage cans locked and not feeding their pets outside.\n\nBut people say the changes aren't helping.\n\n## Too Close For Comfort\n\nInga Bateman had liked living among the black bears  - even if it meant making some changes. She didn't leave pet or bird food out. She got rid of her blueberry bushes. She planted thorny rose bushes to keep the bears away.\n\nBateman, 56, loved telling friends about one Christmas Eve. A bear ate her children's chocolate Santas when she left her car door open.\n\nBut then a bear charged Bateman twice while walking her dogs. Now she is feeling less safe. The last time, she shut her door as the bear tried to get inside her home. She hit it on the nose with the door handle. After she closed the door, the bear started pounding on the windows. It finally walked away, leaving paw prints on the windows.\n\nBateman got so scared that she had to go to the hospital.\n\nShe had called 911. But, no one came.\n\nBateman said, \"I want them to take it more seriously.\"\n\n## A Rising Problem\n\nWiley said the state's bear population was once \"really in trouble.\" But, it has gotten back to \"more natural levels. \" That helps explain the sudden rise in people having problems with the bears.\n\nFlorida's struggle with bears is not unusual, said wildlife scientist John Beecham. Wildlife scientists from New Jersey to Colorado have reported more problems with black bears. Large animals have wandered into parks where children play. And they've been found on walking paths to schools.\n\nNew Jersey and Georgia allow bear hunting as a way to lower the number of bears. However, bear hunting hasn't helped much to control the number of bears in Georgia.\n\nBear hunting is not permitted in Florida.\n\nWiley from the Florida wildlife agency says smart ways to deal with bear problems need to be found. \"Asking about bear hunts I don't think is the right question here.\" '"

            "text": "\tLOS GATOS, Calif. - Three years of drought have dried up California's rivers and streams.\n\nBut one animal might help the water flow again. Beavers may come to the rescue.\n\n\"This state has lost more of its wetlands than all other states,\" said Rick Lanman. He is a beaver expert in California. Wetlands are watery land areas. Often, they are near rivers or other bodies of water. Swamps are one kind of wetland. \"Beavers can rebuild those wetlands,\" Lanman said.\n\n## Trees, Rocks And Mud\n\nCalifornia might bring beavers to dry areas to build dams. To start a dam, beavers drag a tree across a stream. They carry rocks and mud with their paws. They use their big front teeth to carry branches. The dams block off water, so it does not flow away.\n\nBeaver dams help nature in ways that humans cannot easily copy. They change land so that it soaks up water. It is almost like a sponge. This helps makes better soil so more plants can grow. The dams slow down the flow of water.\n\nBeaver dams can help streams flow during the summer. Otherwise, the streams could dry up in the heat.\n\n## Beavers Are Helpers\n\nMichael M. Pollock is with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It is part of the government. Scientists are thinking about using beavers to bring back wetlands, he said.\n\nBeaver ponds are good for the environment, Pollock said. \"They also create a lot of wetland that provides a lot of food for fish.\"\n\nBeaver dams make deep pools. The water in the beaver pools is warmer at the top and cooler at the bottom. Warmer water can hurt fish. \"Fish are able to find the temperature that is ideal for them,\" Pollock said.\n\n## Beavers Can Also Be Troublemakers\n\nThis is not the first time people are using beavers to help nature. Beavers once lived all over California. More than 100 years ago, they were nearly wiped out. Fur traders killed them for their beautiful fur. From the 1920s to 1940s, California used beavers to prevent river banks from wearing away. Beaver dams provide more water to bushes on the sides of rivers. In turn, the bushes keep river banks from crumbling. By 1950, there were 20,000 beavers in California. No one knows how many beavers live in California now.\n\nBeavers can improve damaged streams more cheaply than humans. You cannot just move in a family of beavers, though. Beavers can cause serious damage. That is why California allows beaver hunting. They can also be moved or killed if they cause trouble. Beavers can damage underground pipes. They can also harm farmland. Beaver dams may flood homes.\n\nThe California Fish and Wildlife Department is trying out man-made dams. They will be like beaver dams. If they work, the beavers can stay where they are. The man-made dams will also help avoid the damage beavers can cause.'"

            "text": "\tST. LOUIS - Honeybees are in trouble. They are dying in great numbers, and no one is really sure why.\n\nOne-third of the food we eat depends on pollination by honeybees. Bees carry the pollen from one part of a plant to another. Plants then grow and make the fruit, grains and vegetables we eat. Our food system would not work without the honeybees.\n\nBeekeeping groups have held meetings. Scientists have studied the problem.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) makes sure the food system is working correctly. A USDA report says there may be many causes for the mysterious deaths.\n\nCompanies that make seeds and grow food are also worried. Missouri-based Monsanto Co. bought an Israeli bee research company two years ago. Bayer CropScience is building a huge \"bee health center.\" Syngenta and Bayer are developing what they call an action plan for bee health.\n\nThese businesses are interested in solving the mystery. American crops are worth $20 billion.\n\n## A Drop In The Bee Population\n\nBut some scientists argue it might be the companies' fault. They use a lot of chemicals to protect crops from plant-eating pests.\n\nIn 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were leaving their hives. The number of American bees has gone down by one-third every year since then.  Scientists, beekeepers and farmers are trying to figure out why.\n\nScientists believe there are two main causes. The first is the use of chemicals that kill insects. These chemicals are called insecticides or pesticides.\n\nThe second is a farming system that plants only one kind of crop over a large area. Corn or soybeans are planted this way in the Midwest. This system doesn't leave room for other plants and flowers to grow. Bees lose variety in their diet when there's only one kind of crop around. A limited diet makes the bees less resistant to sickness.\n\nMarla Spivak of the University of Minnesota thinks the chemicals that kill crop pests are also killing bees.\n\n## A Widely Used Pesticide\n\nSome say the worst pesticides for bees are neonicotinoids. They are safer for humans and animals than some other insecticides. For that reason, they are widely used. Neonicotinoids are sprayed on the corn and soybeans planted in the U.S.\n\nHuge numbers of bees died in the spring. Farmers were spraying their corn crops at that time. Scientist Christian Krupke found high levels of neonicotinoid in the dead bees.\n\nKrupke is sure the chemical caused the bees to die. He said it lands on dandelions and even on the bees themselves.\n\nNeonicotinoids are made by Bayer and Syngenta. Their scientists disagree with Krupke.\n\nDavid Fischer works for Bayer CropScience. He said there was no proof that neonics hurt bees. He explained that Bayer depends on bees for pollination. He thought it would be a \"poor business model\" if they were poisoning the bees.\n\n## Too Much Spraying?\n\nSome scientists think neonicotinoids aren't even necessary. The companies claim the pesticide raises the amount of crops they get.\n\nKrupke has done studies to see if that's true. \"We have not found any difference in yield or root damage - nothing,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean it never works,\" he added. He thinks farmers should not spray every kernel of corn.\n\nUnion of Concerned Scientists president Doug Gurian-Sherman calls the problem very serious. He would like to see insecticide use stopped now. Missouri beekeepers would seem to agree.\n\nNeal Bergman is the state's largest beekeeper. He remembers a time when crop planes sprayed fields with the insecticide malathion.\n\n\"They sprayed 400,000 acres of cotton every week,\" he said. \"It didn't matter how the wind was blowing or what time of day it was. They sprayed over people, over animals, over beehives - everything.\"\n\nBergman says his bee population dropped, costing him $1 million. He almost went out of business. Since then, he doesn't trust insecticides. He would like farmers not to spray when the bees are around. He's also giving his bees medicine and extra protein.\n\nBut some say time is running short to solve the mystery.'"

The other looked at how beef is used around the world.\n\nThe first study focused on the United States. It compared raising cows to raising other meats such as pigs or chickens.\n\nThe scientists found that cows needed 28 times more land than the other animals. They also needed 11 times more water.\n\nCows also didn't just take land and water. They also gave off harmful gases, called greenhouse gases.\n\nGreenhouse gases can have an effect on the Earth's temperature. They add to global warming and can hurt the environment.\n\nThe study said cows gave off five times more greenhouse gases than other farm animals.\n\n## What Are Our Choices?\n\nFor people, the clear answer is to replace beef with something else, said Gidon Eshel. Eshel is a scientist.\n\n\"You can still have bacon and eggs and whatever you want. As long as it's not beef, you have made a significant step forward,\" Eshel added.\n\nHe said the study should change people's choices at the grocery store. It should also change laws.\n\nThe second study looked at farms raising cows for beef around the world. The results showed a huge increase in harmful gases linked to animals raised for meat.\n\nPoorer countries saw huge increases in greenhouse gases. They increased the amount of greenhouse gases by more than half from 1961 to 2010. People in these countries have been eating more beef. It is possible that they are copying American habits, one scientist mentioned.\n\nWealthier countries like the United States have been releasing fewer gases since 1970.\n\n## But All Livestock Contribute\n\nBeef cattle produced more than half the gases. Dairy cattle were responsible for less than one-fourth of the gases. Sheep, buffalo, pigs and goats each contributed less than one-tenth. The largest increases came from African countries including Congo, the Central African Republic and Oman.\n\nThe beef industry disagrees with the scientists.

In other words, it is possible to keep them from dying out.\n\nComing back from near extinction is known as _recovery_.\n\n## Making New Herds\n\n\"This shows that recovery is actually\" possible, says biologist Daniel Gammons. Most animals that get close to extinction don't recover. However, he said, \"there's a real opportunity here to see success.\"\n\nIt's taken more than 10 years of careful study to make it happen.\n\nTom Stephenson is leading the recovery project. \"There was a lot of concern about extinction,\" he said. However, things have \"gone as well as anybody could've imagined.\"\n\nIn 2000, teams of biologists began studying the problem. In 2007, they started reintroducing the Sierra Nevada bighorn. They began placing them into herds along the Sierra crest.\n\nSixteen areas were selected for the bighorns. To start out with, only 12 areas will be used. The new Big Arroyo herd that was established in March is the 10th herd so far.\n\nRecovery efforts date back to the 1970s. At that point, very few bighorns were left. They lived in just one area: Wheeler Ridge. The herd there became the \"source population\" for recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. In other words, sheep were taken from Wheeler Ridge and brought to various other areas. That way, new populations had a chance to develop.\n\nNow, four source herds are being used to build new herds. These are large enough to lose several animals at a time.\n\n## Climbing Rugged Rocks\n\nFemale sheep only give birth to one lamb a year. That means the growth of herds is slow. It will likely take another 10 years to meet the goal of 12 new herds.\n\nCurrently, out of 500 bighorn sheep, half are females and half are males. The goal is to have 305 females.\n\nSpotting a bighorn in the wild is very tricky. Their camouflage-like fur makes them masters of disguise: They blend in with the rocky and snowy mountainsides.\n\nBighorns use their excellent vision to spot danger. They then use the rugged rocks as a means of escape: Few animals can scurry up a steep mountainside as fast as they can.\n\nThe bighorn sheep can live as high up as 14,000 feet. During the colder months, they move down to as low as 6,000 feet.\n\nSheep that are resettled are captured with net guns fired out of circling helicopters. Each bighorn is captured individually. It is examined and fitted with a tracking device. Then it is placed in a box and flown to a new herd.\n\nSo far, things have been going smoothly. Stephenson hopes that bighorns will continue to grow in numbers. Soon, they may once again fill the Sierra Nevada mountains.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - A group of bison is loose in the Grand Canyon. Workers are figuring out what to do with the large animals. They are harming plants and water in the Arizona park.\n\nThe group, or herd, used to be hunted. The animals wandered into Grand Canyon National Park several years ago. They cannot be hunted there and now there are nearly 350. Diane Chalfant, a park worker, says the animals know they're safe there.\n\nIt will take almost two years of work to come up with a final plan. Park officials want to get the bison out of the national park. If they move to state lands, the animals can be hunted.\n\n## Bison On The Move\n\nBison are not normally from the Grand Canyon. They were brought to the area more than 100 years ago. People wanted to try to mate bison with cows to make a new type of animal.\n\nThe state bought the herd in 1925. Twenty-five years later it was put in the House Rock Wildlife Area under the control of the state. Hunting kept the size of the herd at about 100 animals.\n\nTwenty or 30 years ago the animals moved to the Grand Canyon, Chalfant said. There are now too many bison in the park and the herd is damaging the area, she said.\n\nPeople couldn't figure out what to do about the herd in the past. Park workers started planning again because of the damage in the park. Bison dig holes too close to water and eat too many of the plants. They crowd out other animals and make soil wash away.\n\nThe National Park Service put a notice in a newspaper in April. It said other government offices will help make new plans. Any plans will be shared with the public before decisions are made.\n\nWorkers want to know what other people think, Chalfant said. But she said the park service wants to move the bison to hunting areas. Hunting will keep the size of the herd smaller.\n\n## Other Animals Can Help Too\n\nSandy Bahr, head of a nature group, wants other animals to hunt the bison, not people. Predators like wolves keep the herd at a better size, Bahr said.\n\nBahr said it's good when the strongest animals stay alive. Hunters tend to shoot the strong ones. They do not shoot the smaller ones that other animals eat. Hunters take the big bison and predators take the small ones. In this way, hunting can hurt the herd, she said.\n\nMoving the bison away will not solve the problem, Bahr said. The animals will just walk back in, where they are safe.\n\n\"These animals don't read maps,\" she said. The animals won't stay out of the park just because people want them to. \"That just doesn't work.\"\n\nShe said the bison need to go so far away that they can't wander back.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Scientists call it \"the blob.\"\n\nIt is actually a huge mass of very warm seawater. The warm water began spreading along the Pacific Coast a year ago.\n\nLate last year, dead sea creatures began washing up on California beaches. Seabirds and sea lions were some of them. Experts say the blob is to blame.\n\nSome experts said the blob could bring huge rains to Southern California this winter. It could also make the Earth warm up even faster.\n\n## That Blob In Water\n\nExperts do not agree on where the blob comes from and what it means. But they are paying close attention to it.\n\nIt is caused by a pattern of wind, ocean current and temperature. Scientists do not completely understand it. Yet they think the pattern is the key to understanding the blob.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean can be warmer for many years, or colder for many years. Then the ocean might switch temperatures suddenly. Warmer water and colder water affect sea life and the climate differently. It is somewhat like the warm and cold ocean temperatures called El Nino and La Nina, but it happens over a longer period of time.\n\nEl Ninos happen when winds near the equator push seawater across the Pacific Ocean. The water from the equator is very warm. The water washes up against North and South America. The warmer water releases heat into the air. It causes powerful storms and flooding.\n\n## Climate Switch-Ups\n\nScientists believe that the Pacific turned especially cold in the late 1990s. The cold water made temperatures drop around the world. But things could flip. Warmer ocean water could heat up the temperature. It could also bring wetter weather for Southern California and the American South.\n\nWilliam Patzert studies the climate at NASA in California. He thinks the climate is switching again. It is going from being cool and dry, to wet and warm again. California has had very little water for four years. If Patzert is right, California's drought could be almost over.\n\nPatzert said this kind of temperature change happened in the 1970s. At the time, the state was struggling through several years of drought.\n\nThen there was a weather change. The water along the coast heated up. The warmer water caused the three wettest years in Los Angeles history, Patzert said.\n\nWarmer waters are like the blob, scientists say.\n\n\"We've definitely entered a warm phase,\" said Nicholas Bond. He is a scientist who studies climate. He also made up the \"blob\" nickname. He says: \"The question now is, how long is it going to last?\"\n\n## Skinny Plankton Are Less Healthy\n\nScientists first discovered the water temperature change in 1997. Pacific salmon can thrive for years. Then they would mysteriously disappear. Scientists wanted to know why. They found that there were healthier plankton in cold water. Plankton are tiny sea creatures that salmon eat. Warmer waters brought skinnier, less healthy plankton.\n\n\"It's like the difference between eating rice cakes and potato chips. You're just not getting the same calories,\" Bond said. Calories are a unit of energy in food. Unhealthy plankton could be one reason that sea birds and sea lion pups are dying in the ocean.\n\nDan Cayan is a climate scientist in California. He said he had no doubt the blob is important. Yet he could not say why or what would happen next. \"The thing that history tells us is that every situation is somewhat different,\" he said.'"

            "text": "b\"MOUNT IDA, Ark. - Scientists are starting to worry that not enough students are studying plant life. Several colleges are also closing their collections of plants. This means fewer people will know things about plants in the future.\n\nA lot fewer colleges offer degrees for becoming a plant scientist now. The government says that 30 years ago, twice as many did. Plant scientists study botany. They are called botanists. Educators say students are being pushed to study technology instead of botany.\n\n## Trend Worries Many Botanists\n\nBotanists are worried. They think that if there are not enough botanists, it will be harder to protect nature. Also, important medicines come from plants. It could even make it harder to develop medicine. At the same time, universities and states are closing their plant collections. They are doing this to save money.\n\nAn example of what botanists do happened in Arkansas. Scientists were looking for a certain plant in a clear spot next to a highway. The plant is called the Missouri bladderpod. The plant has small yellow flowers. It is in danger of dying out. There are only 75 groups of the plant in the world. All the groups are close enough to cities to be in danger, said botanist Theo Witsell. He works for the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission.\n\nWitsell said there were not enough jobs in botany. People are studying other sciences so they can find jobs. He is worried about the future. He wondered what would happen as botanists get older and stop working. There might not be enough new botanists to take their place, he said.\n\n## Understanding Plant Biology Is Important\n\nUnderstanding plants and what they are made of is important, said Joe Miller. He works for the government. A plant's biology is what it is made of and how it lives. If you understand the plant's biology, you know how the plant can be used, he said.\n\nFor example, Quinine is used to treat a disease called malaria. Quinine is found in certain trees. Miller said if botanists find other plants that are like those trees, those plants could be used in medicine, too.\n\nBotanists use plant collections to get information about plants. However, some of those collections are closing. Scientists know collections of plants can be hard to take care of. The temperature and water around the collections have to be kept just right. There also needs to be space to prepare the plants.\n\nThe University of Missouri said in May that it would give its plants to the Missouri Botanical Garden. The university has more than 200,000 plants.\n\nThe building where the plants were kept was getting too old, said Jordan Yount. He works for the university. Yount said the school had a choice. It could spend a lot of money to fix the building or find someplace else for the collection.\n\n## A Few Keep Fighting For Plant Collections\n\nWitsell is fighting to keep the collections open. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock closed its collection a few years ago. After that, Witsell decided the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission needed its own collection.\n\nWitsell and a few other people have searched through the state over the past 12 years. They have collected more than 70,000 different types of plants.\n\nThe collection is a record of plant life in the state and on the planet, Witsell said. It is information you cannot get from a picture, he said.\""

            "text": "\tHOUSTON - Ethan Couch is a rich 16-year-old. In June, he drove after drinking alcohol. He hit four people with his car and killed them. Ethan could have gone to prison for 20 years for his crime. Instead, a Fort Worth judge is not sending Ethan to jail at all.\n\nEthan will be under tight supervision for 10 years. He will also get treatment for being addicted to alcohol. He will have to stay out of trouble for 10 years.\n\nAt Ethan's trial, a doctor who studies behavior spoke. The doctor said that Ethan was not responsible for what he did.\n\nHe said Ethan was too spoiled. He was too focused on material things to control himself. He also said Ethan couldn't understand how what he did could hurt others. In other words, he suffered from \"affluenza\".\n\n## Not A Real Illness\n\n\"Affluenza\" combines the words affluent and influenza. Affluent means \"rich.\" Influenza is \"the flu.\" The term was usually used to describe children from rich families. These children could do bad things like do drugs or drink alcohol. Then they would say they could not be blamed. \"Affluenza\" is not a real illness.\n\nDr. Gary Buffone is a doctor who studies behavior. He is from Florida and he gives advice to rich families. He said \"affluenza\" was never meant to be used in court.\n\nEthan's trial has made experts and the victims' families very angry. They don't believe in \"affluenza.\" They say the judge's choice makes people think that Ethan got out of jail because his family is rich.\n\nWhat the judge has done, Buffone said, is only give the child a time-out for a very serious crime. It's very scary, he said.\n\nIn court, there was a prosecution lawyer. He was fighting to put Ethan in jail. The lawyer said Ethan would only do more bad things if he was not put in jail.\n\n## Sending A Bad Message?\n\nThe judge has not openly said why she didn't send Ethan to prison. A newspaper reported that the judge said Ethan's parents could afford good therapy for him. The judge said it was better than what he would get in jail. His parents would pay to send him to an expensive treatment center in California.\n\nSuniya Luthar is a doctor who studies behavior. She has done research on kids from rich areas. She said just under a fourth of upper middle-class teens think their parents would help them get out of a sticky situation at school. Ethan's court case backs up that thinking, she said. Luthar said there is one type of justice for the rich. There is another type for the poor.\n\nThe case sends the message that \"you can drink and drive\" if your family has money. This is a very, very scary thing to tell our children, she said.\n\nEthan hit and killed 43-year-old Brian Jennings. He killed 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell and 21-year-old Shelby Boyles. He also killed Shelby's mother, 52-year-old Hollie Boyles.\n\nScott Brown, Ethan's main lawyer, said supervision was the right choice. The teenager could have been freed after two years if he had been sentenced to 20 years in prison, he said. Instead, Ethan will be under heavy supervision for the next 10 years, he said.'"

A war is happening inside Afghanistan. Salim has left Afghanistan and come to the United States.\n\nHere in the United States, 14-year-old Salim is part of a much smaller family. He lives with Sandy Tabor-Gray and Jim Gray in Mooresville, North Carolina.\n\nSalim (sounds like Sa-leem) has been living with the Grays since June. He is being treated for a damaged arm. The treatment is free. It comes from Solace for the Children. Solace means help or comfort. Solace for the Children is a group that helps sick or hurt children who live in war-torn countries.\n\n## Salim Is Still Growing\n\nSince arriving in the United States, Salim has had an operation on his left arm. The arm was badly hurt in 2013 when Salim touched a live wire while trying to untangle his kite. He was electrocuted. Doctors had to remove most of Salim's arm.\n\nIn 2014, he was chosen by Solace for the Children to come to the Hanger Clinic. The clinic treats people who have lost arms or legs. Salim was fitted with a prosthetic, a man-made arm. This year, Salim returned because his prosthetic arm no longer fit.\n\nAs soon as Michael Jenks saw Salim, the reason why was clear. Salim had grown, so the prosthesis was no longer the right size. Jenks runs the Hanger Clinic.\n\nSo Jenks called his friend, Doctor Glenn Gaston, who said he would help Salim.\n\n## Group Works For Free To Help Kids\n\nIn August, the doctor operated. Later, Salim and Tabor-Gray, went back to see Gaston and Jenks to make sure everything was healing well.\n\n\"Hey, buddy. How ya doing?\" Gaston asked Salim as he walked into the exam room. Salim smiled shyly.\n\nSalim said he was feeling no pain. He showed the doctor that he could move the arm easily.\n\n\"That's awesome,\" Jenks said. He measured Salim for a new prosthetic arm.\n\nEach summer, Solace for the Children brings a group of children to the United States. The trip costs $6,000 to $8,000 for each child.\n\nSolace for the Children is given the money it needs by people who want to help. Almost everyone who works for them works for free. The group is in Mooresville, North Carolina. It finds families where the children can stay in cities such as Los Angeles, California, and Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n## \"We Send Them Home As Friends\"\n\nTabor-Gray heard about Solace for the Children from people at her church.\n\nShe and her husband have hosted 10 children, including Salim, and she has traveled to Afghanistan twice. She said Solace for the Children helps to bring peace.\n\n\"We want to show these children what peace looks like,\" she said. \"We teach them, you are brothers and sisters of one country. We send them home as friends.\"\n\nSalim will be in the United States for a few more weeks before returning to his family in Afghanistan.\n\nHe is learning exercises that will make him stronger so he can handle the weight of his prosthetic arm.\n\nHe is also learning new ways to do things he used to do with his left arm. For example, Salim was left-handed before his accident. He has learned to write his name with his new arm.\n\nAsked how he feels about Tabor-Gray, Salim answered through a translator. \"She's really nice,\" he said. \"I'm thankful that she loves me like her own son.\"'"

            "text": "\tANDKHOY, Afghanistan - Esmatullah is a day worker who got engaged in 1999 at age 26. His bride-to-be was a young girl from a village near Andkhoy, in western [Afghanistan](http://www.newsela.com/articles/?query=Afghanistan). She was chosen for him and he was eager to wed. Fourteen years later, Esmatullah is still single.\n\nAfghan weddings have many ancient traditions. One of them is the custom known as walwar. It requires the groom-to-be to pay cold cash to the bride's father. The sum can top $20,000. This is much more money than a working-class Afghan can afford.\n\nAndkhoy is a town of carpet makers and wheat farmers. Here, [men who want to get married](http://www.newsela.com/articles/syrian-brides/levels/790) borrow money from relatives and friends. They pay the money back over months or years. For workers like Esmatullah, the amount is far out of reach. The girl's family demands $13,000. Friends and relatives lent him $8,000. But he has no way of coming up with the rest.\n\n\"I make $6 a day as a day laborer,\" says Esmatullah. \"God knows how long it will take me to raise the rest.\"\n\n## Tradition Goes Back Centuries\n\nWomen's rights supporters don't like the tradition. They say it puts a price tag on a daughter. The money gives people the idea that women are little more than property. \"It's basically money that the father gets for selling his daughter,\" says Mojgan Mostafavi. She is a member of the Afghan Women's Affairs Ministry. \"They are saying, 'You are like our animal.' \"\n\nWalwar is against the law. But officials allow it because it has been a part of Afghan tribal ways for hundreds of years. Punishing fathers or grooms who make walwar payments is rare, Mostafavi says.\n\nMostafavi called on religious leaders, reporters, and police to help end the practice. She said it breaks both Afghan and religious law. Recently, about 400 religious leaders came to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan,  to oppose walwar. They agreed to argue against the tradition at their mosques. Most Afghans are Muslim and worship in mosques.\n\nWalwar is not the only thing that keeps couples from getting married in Afghanistan. The average worker makes $35 a month. But Afghans spend tens of thousands of dollars on a wedding. They often invite hundreds of guests.\n\nAsadullah is a 21-year-old law student. He spent $28,000 on his wedding: $13,000 was for walwar, $12,000 went to the bride's gold jewelry, another tradition; the reception cost $3,000. \"It's a lot of money, but this is our society,\" says Asadullah. \"We have no choice but to pay.\"\n\n## Weddings Are Costly Too\n\nIn 2011, some politicians proposed a bill to limit weddings to no more than 500 guests. The Women's Affairs Ministry supported the bill. But it was rejected by President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet. It didn't make it to a vote, Mostafavi says.\n\n\"They are spending so much money, but these families often don't have enough money to buy food,\" she says. \"I know some families that have had 3,000 to 4,000 guests at their weddings. In this country, a boy has to work so many years and borrow so much money to have a wedding. Why is this happening? It's a big roadblock for girls and boys in this society.\"\n\nPride is a main reason why Afghans spend so much on large weddings, says Samir Rostiyar. He owns a wedding hall in Kabul. Families enjoy going one better than their friends and neighbors. Even if they're not competitive, they don't want the shame of being called cheap.\n\nBig, fancy weddings are also a way of escaping everyday life.\n\n\"Afghanistan has been at war for 30 years,\" Rostiyar says. \"People spend this much money to get a break from all the misery.\"\n\n## A Long Time To Pay Walwar\n\nAfghanistan got rid of its last king in 1973. Since then, control of the country has changed often. Communists, the Taliban, and now the current government have all fought for power. Young people getting married have never experienced peace time in their own country.\n\nAbdullah Rahman got engaged a year ago. The father of the woman he was going to marry set the walwar price at $15,000. Rahman and his family bargained him down to $10,000.\n\nTo begin raising the money, Rahman had to leave college. He did odd jobs in his hometown of Andkhoy. He's been able to pay his future father-in-law only about $1,000.\n\n\"My father's working and I'm working to make the money,\" Rahman said. \"I have no idea how long it will take. It's very hard to focus on life, focus on saving the money. It's a tradition and we have to pay it, but I hope someday someone gets rid of this custom.\"'"

So when they see trucks painted like giant hot dogs on the streets, many are puzzled.\n\nThe trucks sell fast food, including hot dogs.\n\nFood trucks are popular all over North America. Now, they have made it all the way to Kabul.\n\nNaveed Noori is the man behind the new hot-dog trucks.\n\nNoori lives in Kabul, but his wife and daughter live in Toronto, Canada. While in Toronto, Noori learned how popular food trucks are. Now, he has brought them to Afghanistan.\n\n## Hot Dogs On Wheels\n\nIn May, Noori and his cousin, Abdullah Karim, started their new company. It is called Lazeez, which means \"delicious.\"\n\nThe new business sells hot dogs, burgers and chicken sandwiches. Food is sold from the back of five small trucks. Inside each truck there are hot plates and deep-fryers.\n\nOn a cool fall morning, Noori visited one of his trucks. It was parked on a busy street in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.\n\nThe hot-dog-on-wheels stood out among all the plain-looking cars and minibuses. Its sides were painted with bright yellow stripes that looked like mustard. Its roof was meant to be a sesame-seed bun.\n\nSeveral cars came to a halt on seeing the strange truck. Their drivers had puzzled expressions. The Lazeez truck driver is also the cook. He had put on a hair net and gloves and was grilling burgers.\n\n\"People don't know what exactly this is,\" Noori said.\n\n## A Happy New Customer\n\nAs Noori stood by the Lazeez truck, a black car carrying five young men screeched to a stop. One of the men stepped out and studied the menu. He said his name was Mohammed Idris.\n\nIdris ordered five chicken sandwiches. Together, they cost only $7.\n\nWhen Idris bit into his sandwich he seemed impressed.\n\n\"It's my first time here,\" he said. \"I didn't know what a food truck was.\"\n\nHot dogs are not well known in Afghanistan. The chicken hot dogs Lazeez uses are shipped in from Pakistan. The rest of the food is cooked at the company's offices. Each week, thousands of chicken patties are prepared there.\n\nThe cousins have plans to buy five more trucks. They also want to launch a home delivery service. For now, they sell about $450 worth of food every day, Noori said.\n\n## Burger Challenge\n\nRohit Shuja is one of Lazeez's drivers. He had never cooked before he began working for the company. Now, he grills chicken and works the fryer like a pro.\n\nShuja said his biggest challenge is dealing with police officers. They sometimes ask why he is parked where he is.\n\n\"We have to explain to them every day what we are doing,\" Shuja said.\n\nThere is a simple way to get rid of nosy police officers, though.\n\n\"We give them a burger or two,\" Noori said, \"and they go away.\"'"

            "text": "\tBAND-E AMIR NATIONAL PARK, Afghanistan - People in Afghanistan have seen a lot of unusual, bad things because of a very long war. But one of the most unusual things is actually pretty fun - swan boats.\n\nNearly 40 of the boats cruised the blue waters of the main lake on a recent day. The boats, which are shaped like birds, were packed with families. They have foot pedals so people can make them move.\n\nWomen laughed loudly on several of the boats. That is a very rare sound in public in the country.\n\nAfghans have long believed that the waters of the six lakes known as Band-e Amir can cure illness. Now the lakes help people relax. They can get away from the horrors of bombs, suicide attacks and corrupt police.\\n## Country's First National Park\n\nThe area is peaceful and beautiful. It sits high in central Afghanistan. Four years ago it became Afghanistan's first national park.\n\nMore and more Afghans have been coming here. They come even though many have to drive a day or more. And they have to travel through areas filled with rebels.\n\nIn 2008 about 200 visitors came each month during May to September, said David Bradfield. He works for the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. He's based at the park. The society helped develop a plan for the park with the U.S. government. This year, average attendance on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, is 4,000 to 5,000.\n\nThe park is very special for women and children. They have few places in the country to go outside and enjoy life.  Worries about bombs, gunfights or controlling males make being out in public difficult. About half the visitors are children and 35 percent are women, said Mirza Hussain, the chief ranger.\n\n\"This is my first time ever out of Kabul, and this place makes me feel really happy and calm,\" said Mustura Baqer. She drove several hours from the capital. Traveling with her were her husband, Mohammed, a construction manager, and their 9-month-old son.\\n## Powers Of The Waters\n\nThey were sitting with Mohammed's brother and sister-in-law, Tamana Noori, inside a tent. The tent blocked the chill from the high altitude. They were nibbling on salad, flatbread and chicken in a dark tomato sauce.\n\nNoori said she, her husband and their three children had visited the park 11 times. They'd made three trips so far this year.\n\n\"It is a nice place for everybody, and the most beautiful place in the country,\" she said. \"Kids can play around, and we feel safer here than any other place. People are afraid of attacks in Kabul and other places, but not here.\"\n\nA visit to Band-e Amir often is mixed with religion. The same is true with a lot of things in Afghanistan. The Baqers' son has epilepsy. They hoped that the powers of the mineral waters would help.\n\nPeople say that Ali, the cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, created the lakes. That is why people think the lakes have the power to heal. Muhammad is Islam's great prophet.\n\nPeople say Ali created the lakes through amazing feats. He carved out the valley with his sword. Then he made dams out of cheese.\\n## Private Area For Women\n\nThe six lakes of the park are indeed blocked out with something filled with holes. It looks like cheese. But it is really rock. It is made from the minerals in the water.\n\nThe dams have small waterfalls spilling over them. They make the series of lakes seem like huge, watery steps that stretch for miles. Each one appears higher than the next.\n\nWomen must wear clothes when they plunge into the chilly lake water. And they must do so out of the sight of men. So, a walled area is being built so that women may take dips privately.\n\nThe Afghan government just approved the hiring of the park's first women rangers. This should help the women visitors a lot.'"

            "text": "\tKABUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob adjusts his Boy Scout neckerchief. He leans over and plants a sapling into the dry Kabul soil. Two helicopters pass overhead. The clack-clack clack-clack of their blades echoes off the neighboring mountains.\n\nIt seems dangerous for young boys to wear matching uniforms in a war zone. But leaders of Afghanistan's new Scouting program say community service is badly needed. So is learning to rely on yourself.\n\nAyob was orphaned as a child and is being raised by his aunt. He can barely afford to attend high school, and is worried about finding a job. But his worries disappear when he puts on his Scout shirt. \"I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud,\" said Ayob, 18. \"Scouts are like my family.\"\n\nThe Scout motto is \"Be Prepared.\" This has a very special meaning in Afghanistan. Here Scouts risk death to attend meetings. They have to learn how to spot roadside bombs in first aid class.\n\n## Keeping Girl Scouts Safe\n\nBecause of these dangers, Girl Scouts are much less visible. The girls do volunteer work in hospitals instead of working outside like the boys.\n\nMohammad Tamim Hamkar is Afghan Scouting's program manager. He said that \"it's hard to let the girls do everything.\"\n\nYet organizers say that girls often make better Scouts than boys. That's because the girls have to grab any chances they can get in a country that is dominated by men and boys. Keith Blackey, 68, is an American helping the Scouts in Afghanistan. He said that some girls get confidence from wearing a Scout uniform. \"It's like a superhero putting on a cape,\" he said.\n\n## A Hard History\n\nThings have been difficult for Scouts in Afghanistan over the years. Scouting was introduced in 1931. The movement has been banned several times. Sometimes, Scouts were even told to spy on their parents.\n\nA charity called Parsa supported the Afghan Scouts in 2009. Parsa sees Scouting as a way to teach leadership to children. There are Scout groups in six of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Most of these places are too dangerous for international visitors.\n\nHamkar said that some of the Scout uniforms are very old. Some of the Scouting books are unfinished. There is very little money to go around. At the moment, Scouting in Afghanistan is paid for by donations from other countries.\n\nBut the program now has 1,062 members, 40 percent of them girls. It hopes to have 1,500 Scouts signed up by the end of 2013.\n\n## An Uncertain Future\n\nTerrorists in Afghanistan may attack anyone they think has been involved with foreign countries. The Scout movement is linked to the Western world. This could be dangerous for Afghan scouts if there is further trouble in the country. In 2014, soldiers from the U.S. and its allies will withdraw from Afghanistan. No one is sure what will happen after this.\n\nMarnie Gustavson is the head of Parsa. \"If things get ugly, anything with an international connection could be targeted,\" said Gustavson.  Scout leaders are working hard to make Scouting a part of Afghan life.\n\nIn Ghor province, Scouts clean mosques. This shows that the program is not trying to threaten Afghan traditions. Blackey said that Scouting is not trying to promote a different religion. \"We're teaching them the same things their parents are,\" the adviser added.\n\n## Can Scouting Survive?\n\nDuring the dark years in Afghanistan, loyal Scouts were forced to hide their uniforms. \"I was too scared to wear mine, even alone in my room,\" said training commissioner Mustafa. \"Sometimes I'd peek in the drawer, though, and remember better times.\"\n\nMike Farrar is another American who helps to train Afghan Scouts. He believes the program is important to the country.\n\n\"I never went to a Scout meeting where I had to wear a flak jacket and carry a weapon,\" he said. \"If the Taliban comes back, obviously Scouting goes away. But if the Taliban doesn't, Afghanistan will embrace it.\"'"

Women in her country are not supposed to work outside the home.\n\nBahai took on her unusual job because she loves driving. She also has a large family to support.\n\nShe still remembers her first time behind the wheel. \"I felt like I was in the sky, and I totally fell in love with driving,\" she said.\n\n## Driving Is A Bold Choice\n\nIn Afghanistan, many people still feel women should not work, except at home. Men get angry if a woman even goes out by herself.\n\nBahai is about 40 years old. She has been following her own path for years. She never got married, as women are expected to do in Afghanistan. She had to support her parents and other people in her family, she said. She feared a husband would stop her from working.\n\nBecause she had no children of her own, Bahai adopted two boys. Both are now in high school.\n\nBahai's brother-in-law was killed some years ago. After that happened, Bahai took in her sister and seven nieces and nephews. She now supports a dozen people.\n\n## She Wants To Change Things For Women\n\nBahai drives her cab around the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Her yellow and white cab is spotlessly clean.\n\nBahai gets phone calls from people who tell her to \"not drive in the city because I am a woman,\" she said.\n\nMen who get into her cab seem \"very jealous,\" she said. Often, they are very rude to her and some threaten her.\n\n\"I don't care what they think of me, I am not afraid,\" she said. She will do what she can to change things for women in her country, she said.\n\nBahai began driving a cab in 2002. She also fixes cars and teaches other women to drive.\n\n## Stuck In Old Ideas\n\nIdeas about women are slowly changing in Afghanistan. However, outside the big cities, things are pretty much the same as they always were.\n\nMany Afghanis still feel that women should not go out alone. They think women should only go outside with a man from their family. Women who go out alone can be treated very badly.\n\nStill, things have gotten better. Millions of girls now go to school. It is no longer unusual for women to travel to other countries by themselves. Some women now live alone in big Afghan cities.\n\n## It Can Be A Happy Place To Live\n\nRula Ghani is Afghanistan's new first lady. She has been fighting for women's rights since her husband became president in September.\n\nThe first lady gave an important speech on Sunday. She said that Afghan \"women should be respected both inside and outside their homes.\" They should become \"doctors, engineers, soldiers, police officers.\"\n\nBahai says things are slowly getting better for Afghan women. They are starting to live their own lives, just like her.\n\n\"Step by step everything is going to be all right,\" she said.\n\n\"My message for Afghan women is to stand up for yourselves,\" she said. \"Help to make Afghanistan a happy place to live.\"'"

She never went to school and spent her life raising seven children.\n\nToday, Shah, who is 50, does not leave home without a male relative. In public, she wears a burka, a long gown covering her entire body for modesty. Her face is hidden behind a veil. Shah obeys Afghan customs, she says.\n\nHer daughter, Ghazalan Koofi, lives a life her mother could never have imagined. She goes out by herself, working for the government during the day and attending university at night. Koofi, 28, speaks perfect English and has never worn a burka. She dresses stylishly but modestly. Her wavy black hair peeks out from under a head scarf.\n\nKoofi demands the respect of her male coworkers. She treasures her \"love marriage\" with the husband she chose for herself. Most Afghan marriages are arranged by families, like her parents' marriage. Often the couple has not met before getting married.\n\nKoofi's husband calls her \"a very brave woman.\" He helps with housework and caring for their baby son. Some of his male friends think men shouldn't help out around the house. They see it as weak and shameful.\n\n## \"Those Terrible Days\"\n\nKoofi was a teenager when the United States invaded [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) in 2001. The U.S. went to war against the Taliban because the Taliban gave help to Osama Bin Laden. Bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States. Women had no freedom under the Taliban. They weren't allowed to attend school. They had to wear the burka in public. And they couldn't go outside without a male relative. With the Taliban gone, women gained more freedom.\n\nBut U.S. combat troops are leaving Afghanistan next year. And Koofi and other Afghan women worry that the Taliban will take over. Their new freedoms might disappear.\n\n\"We are entering a very dangerous period for women,\" says Koofi. \"I'm very worried that we will return to those terrible days.\"\n\nShukriya Matin was in grade school when her family ran from the Taliban in 1996. She was beaten for not properly covering her hair in public.\n\nFor six long years, she was a low-paid child carpet weaver in Pakistan. Now 26, she runs a program at a Kabul hospital.\n\nHer mother, Zahra Matin, 52, was engaged at 9 and married at 13. She never learned to read. Zahra Matin dreams of her granddaughter attending college.\n\nBut she worries the Taliban will come back and destroy their dreams.\n\n## An Insecure Future\n\nThe freedoms of Afghan women are again threatened. A law passed in 2009 was supposed to stop violence against women, but it is usually ignored. And the Afghan official for human rights wants to get rid of the law. Violent crimes against women have reached record levels.\n\nAfghanistan is still a traditional Islamic country. Some village girls as young as 9 or 10 are forced by their families to marry much older men. Girls who flee arranged marriages are often hunted down by their families. They are sometimes beaten and even killed.\n\nThere have been clear gains since the overthrow of the Taliban. Women now have the right to vote. Some women serve as lawmakers, and have joined the army and police. There are 150 female judges.\n\nUnder the Taliban, the only education for girls was in secret home schools, which were forbidden. Today, 3 million girls attend school. But that's still only 4 of every 10 school-age girls.\n\nIn the last six months, four Afghan policewomen have been killed. Female government officials are regularly threatened or killed.\n\nFawzia Koofi is an Afghan lawmaker. She is also Ghazalan Koofi's aunt. When the Taliban ruled over the country, she taught at a secret school for girls. She has been threatened with death. Yet, she plans to run for president in 2018.\n\nThe future for women is not secure, Fawzia Koofi said. Freedoms can easily be taken away.'"

She listened to Russian classical music.\n\nIn her home, though, there was also American music. There were Thanksgiving celebrations too. Soul food sometimes replaced Russian beet soup.\n\nThat is because her father, George Tynes, was an African-American from Virginia. He moved to Russia in 1931.\n\nTynes was not alone. During the 1920s and 1930s, hundreds of blacks traveled to Russia.\n\n\"My father didn't know anything about this country. He didn't know what to expect,\" Tynes-Mensah, age 73, said as she sat in her Moscow apartment.\n\n## Better Pay, Cheap Houses\n\nMost African-Americans who came to Russia were seeking a better life. They were hoping to escape the racism they faced in the United States.\n\nToday, fewer than 50 of their descendants still live in Russia.\n\nOnce, Russia was eager to bring in skilled foreigners. Thousands of Americans came to work in Russia during the 1930s. Among them were several hundred African-Americans.\n\nThe African-Americans who came to Russia were highly educated. They included engineers, teachers, entertainers, journalists and lawyers.\n\nRussia gave them special treatment. They received big paychecks, cheap homes and free vacations.\n\n## Fitting In With Russian Society\n\nTynes-Mensah said her father felt that Russia treated him better than America. \"He was happy here.\"\n\nTynes was an agricultural expert. Nonetheless, back in America he could only find work washing dishes, his daughter said. So he jumped at the chance to go to Russia.\n\nMost of the African-Americans who came to Russia had very good experiences. In turn, they added to Russian society. African-American agricultural experts helped come up with different uses for plants. They also helped to develop new plants that were cheaper to grow.\n\nTynes was sent to farms to teach people how to raise ducks and other waterfowl. He became well known as an expert.\n\nThere were never many African-Americans in Russia. However, they got a lot of attention.\n\n## Times Have Changed In Russia\n\nEventually, such attention became unwelcome. After the leader Josef Stalin came to power, foreigners were no longer trusted. People who were not citizens were ordered to leave the country.\n\nThings only got worse after 1947. From 1947 to 1991, the United States and Russia were involved in the Cold War. There was no military fighting, but the two countries became enemies and made threats aimed at each other.\n\nAfrican-Americans still living in Russia were not treated well during this time. However, this was not because they were black, but because they were foreigners.\n\nToday, many Africans have moved to Russia. Racism is now a problem there.\n\nTynes-Mensah is half African-American. Her mother was Russian-Ukrainian. Growing up in Russia, she realized that people saw her as different from most Russians.\n\n\"I was afraid to go out in public,\" said Tynes-Mensah, who has light brown skin and a short Afro. \"People used to stare - but it was curiosity. They were not angry.\"\n\nTynes-Mensah lives most of the year in the United States now, but still spends summers in Russia.'"

She had come to the U.S. against the law. \n\nEmilio now lives with his grandmother and younger sister. Emilio recently got in trouble with the police. He hopes going to school will help him \"out of the struggle.\" An education will help Emilio and his family lead better lives.\n\nEmilio goes to an after-school program in Orosi called Tech Connect. He learns how to repair computers. The program also helps students in many other ways.\n\n## Everyone Goes To College\n\nEvery student in Tech Connect has gone on to college. This is a great achievement. Over half the adults in their town did not finish high school.\n\nMiguel Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda started Tech Connect in 2009. Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda grew up in a poor farming area. He believes students in poor areas should have the same chances as those in richer areas.\n\n\"It's hard out here,\" he says about the town of Orosi. He added that many people get paid very little to work as farm workers. The town has many gangs and can be dangerous.\n\n## Only 30 Places For More Than 100 Applicants\n\nThe Tech Connect Class lasts for one year. There are only 30 spaces. More than 100 high school students usually sign up. Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda does not take only the kids with the best grades. He looks for students who really want, and need, to learn.\n\nEmilio is one of those young people. Even with his troubles, Emilio graduated from high school two years early at age 16.\n\nOne of the reasons Emilio loves Tech Connect is because Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda has become like a father.\n\nNot long ago, Emilio sat in the classroom. He listened to sirens screaming in the distance outside. \n\n\"Right now, it's helping me stay out of those sirens, right?\" says Emilio. \"It will help me build some character, help out my people, you know? I feel like it's a good choice, to help out.\"\n\n## A Leader Who Does Whatever It Takes\n\nAt Tech Connect, students learn how to fix computers. They are also required to do community service. They clean up graffiti around town and feed the homeless. They teach adults how to use computers. \n\nCastaneda also takes students on field trips to colleges and tutors them. He helps them find jobs, too.\n\nAdylene Saucedo is 15. She says Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda is a great leader. \"He will do whatever he can to help you out.\"\n\n## A Great Role Model\n\nElizabeth Gonzalez writes grants, or letters, asking the government for money to help pay for Tech Connect. Recently, she watched Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda teach students about computer parts. \"This subject could be really boring, but as you can see, the kids are really engaged,\" she said. \n\nMany of Emilio's classmates agree that Casta\\xc3\\xb1eda is a great role model. He had a rough life when he was young, says Christian Salacup, 15. Still, he was able to find his way. \"He teaches us to help your community, help other people,\" added Christian. \n\nEmilio hopes to go to community college. Then he will transfer to a four-year college. He is sure the skills he has learned through Tech Connect will help him.\n\n\"Hopefully I get to get out of my struggle too,\" he said.'"

Valerie was in class at Colonial High School.\n\nTimothy App teaches Valerie's class. The class is part of a Veterinary Animal Science and Services program. The students learn about all kinds of animals and how to take care of them.\n\nOther schools in the Orange County school district in Florida have programs like this, too. Danny Garner works for the schools. His job is to set up agriscience classes. The classes teach the science of agriculture, such as how to run a farm and take care of animals.\n\n## Few Folks Become Farmers Now\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture is part of the government. It studies farming. It said that the number of Americans who work in agriculture has shrunk greatly. In 1900, almost half of all people worked in agriculture. Today, it is less than 2 out of every 100 people. \n\nNot many kids today want to be farmers. Still, these classes can be helpful to students. They learn public speaking, debating and critical thinking. They are skills students will need for any job.\n\nGarner said that every student can learn something from the agriscience program. Teachers in the Orange County school district say that studying agriscience can help students prepare for many different jobs. They can become veterinarians, scientists or experts in food nutrition. \n\n## Learning About Jobs In High School\n\nApp believes that students should learn about different jobs in high school. \"I want them to find out what they want to do before they go to college,\" App said.\n\nMany students come to the schools in Orange County because of the agriscience program. Some of them live far away, but want to learn to be veterinarians. \n\nApp said he teaches about all kinds of animals, but the kids really like snakes. He keeps snakes in glass tanks in the classroom. \n\nHis classroom used to have chinchillas, but the noise from students was not good for the animals. Snakes are a better fit for a busy school.\n\nThe class has larger animals outside. Behind the school, a couple of large tortoises are in a pen. Dozens of chickens are kept in a coop. Three sheep waited to be fed in a covered area.\n\n## Kids Arrive Early To Feed Animals\n\nMost of App's students live in homes with small yards and apartments. They do not have room for farm animals. App lets his most serious students keep farm animals near the school. Families have to buy the animals with their own money. \n\nStudents get to school before the first class starts to feed the goats. Students also have to take care of the animals on weekends and over school breaks.\n\nOne of the sheep that lives at Colonial High belongs to Valerie. She is raising the animal for a school project.\n\nIt takes Valerie 45 minutes to get to school. The extra time in the car is worth it, she said, because it's good preparation for veterinary school.\n\n\"There would be no means for me to raise these animals if it weren't for this program,\" she said.'"

For that reason, many Inupiat hunt for game, or large animals. They eat the meat to survive. Hunting is an important part of their culture.  \n\nSome older Inupiat live in nursing homes. One is called Utugganaat Inaat. It means \"a place for elders\" in Inupiat. Not long ago, the residents were served musk ox meatloaf.\n\nThey loved it. Their visiting families loved it too. Val Kreil works at the nursing home. He recalled that one young relative said the meal was \"the bomb!\"\n\n\"You don't hear that every day about meatloaf,\" Kreil said.\n\n## More Traditional Foods Are Being Cooked\n\nThe cooks at the nursing home are making more meals with traditional foods. The food is given to the nursing home by hunters. Last year, a new national law passed that will make it easier to serve foods loved by Alaska Natives and Native Americans.\n\nThe law allows some groups to donate, or give, food to nursing homes. They can also give food to programs for children and other places where people live or receive care. Some of the programs and places that will be getting food are run by Native American tribes and tribal groups.\n\nTraditional foods like corn and bison can be bought. They are already served in some nursing homes and other places. The new law will allow many more foods to be purchased. Venison, moose, caribou and reindeer can now be bought.\n\n## Elders Are Happy To Eat Special Meats\n\nLeslie Wheelock works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA is a government department that makes food safety rules. The new law helps Native Americans continue eating traditional foods, she said.  \n\nSome Native Americans live in an area called the Navajo Nation. It is a Navajo land inside Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. The Birds Springs chapter is a Navajo group in Arizona. It is building a nursing home. It will open next year. Residents will hopefully eat elk and deer, along with squash and beans from Navajo farmers.\n\nThomas Walker works for the chapter. He said the elders deserve to keep eating meals they have loved their whole lives. Their traditional foods make them happy and healthy.\n\n## Caribou Stew \"Was Wonderful\"\n\nAlaska already had a law that allowed some traditional foods to be served.\n\nHowever, a new factory down the road will be very helpful to the nursing home in Alaska. Meat donated by hunters is cleaned and stored at the factory. \n\nThe residents at the nursing home tasted their first donated meat a few months ago. It was the musk ox meatloaf. Until then, they had to wait for monthly family potluck dinners to enjoy the food they grew up with. \n\nNot long ago the factory processed caribou meat for the nursing home. Some of the meat went into a chunky stew with potatoes.\n\n\"It was wonderful,\" said Mary Reed, who is 80. She lives at the home. She had not eaten caribou for a long time. \n\nOne thing is for sure. They gobble up their meals and do not leave any crumbs behind.'"

He is thinking hard about the apple's taste.\n\nThe apple is \"perfectly good,\" he says. However, that is all it is. It is \"not excellent - not a wow.\" He tosses the apple to the ground. Then, he sprays a stripe of orange paint down the tree's trunk.\n\nThe stripe tells the orchard crew to cut down the tree. \"You're going to the firewood farm,\" he says to the tree.\n\nBedford is an easygoing guy. However, he is unforgiving when it comes to producing the next great apple.\n\nAfter many years as an apple breeder, Bedford knows what he is looking for. Unfortunately, this apple is not it. So the tree will have to go to make room for trees that could produce tastier apples.\n\n## It Is Tasty Work\n\nBedford works for the University of Minnesota's apple-breeding program. During apple season, he will take a bite out of as many as 600 apples a day.\n\nThe apples he tastes are from new kinds of apple trees. The new trees are created by crossing two different types of trees. If the fruit of a new tree seems good, the tree will be saved. If not, it is back to the drawing board.\n\nBedford's sense of what is a good apple and what is not is important. It shapes what people find in grocery stores.\n\nBedford is one of the best apple breeders in the world, said grower John Jacobson. He is great at spotting the apples people will love.\n\nBedford does not do the job alone. He's been working with Jim Luby for 30 years.\n\nHowever, the day-to-day work is done by Bedford. He is the one who tastes all those so-so apples in hopes of finding the next big thing.\n\nBedford makes \"the decisions about what gets thrown out,\" Luby said. Ninety-nine out of 100 apples get tossed, he added.\n\n## We Love The Honeycrisp\n\nThe program's biggest success is the Honeycrisp apple. The Honeycrisp was first introduced in 1991. It is now one of the most popular apples in the country. \"It's a doggone good apple,\" Mark Seetin of the U.S. Apple Association said.\n\nBedford looks for certain things when judging apples. Appearance is not that important. Crunchiness and flavor are the two most important things, he said.\n\nAchieving the perfect apple takes a lot of experimentation. Bedford crosses different parent trees. His hope is that their offspring will produce the perfect fruit.\n\nHis newest apple still needs a real name. For now, it is simply called MN55. The fruit will not be in markets for a couple of years, but Bedford is excited about it.\n\nMN55 is the child of Honeycrisp and an Arkansas apple type. The result is an apple that tastes much like Honeycrisp. The new apple is also better in some ways. It grows better in hot weather and ripens earlier.\n\nJacobson was sure MN55 was a winner when he first tasted it in mid-August. \"I ate it, and thought, 'This is really something.'\"\n\nBedford is now 63 years old. However, he does not want to stop working anytime soon. He wants to keep breeding apples for as long as he can.\n\n\"If an apple a day keeps the doctor away, I'll live forever,\" he said with a smile.'"

Together they formed People Helping People. This group gives aid to border crossers.\n\nVolunteers keep the office running. They answer questions and hand out medical aid kits. They also hand out water bottles and baggies of food for border crossers. The bags are filled with things like potato chips, juice boxes and canned meat. People stash them in their cars or homes in case they come across a border crosser in need.\n\nDoctors and nurses give medical aid classes at the office. A Spanish class teaches a few simple Spanish words. For example, students learn the words for water: _agua_. And they learn the word for food: _comida_.\n\n## Giving Food And Water\n\nAlex Huesler is glad he got a food bag from the office. Two men walked up to the backyard of his Arivaca home several months ago. One man was Mexican. The other was from Nicaragua.\n\n\"Agua, agua,\" the men said to Huesler.\n\nOne of the men had a bloodied face. He had scratched it when he fell on a tree, Huesler said.\n\nHe says the men told him they'd tried to ask one of his neighbors for water. But they were sent away.\n\n\"I understand that sometimes they are afraid,\" he said of the neighbors. \"I never felt any fear or any cause to fear the people that I've met.\"\n\nHuesler said he gave the men food and water from a bag. He had nothing in his refrigerator.\n\nHe also called a friend for help bandaging up the injured traveler. The man was taken to a hospital. The other man walked away.\n\n## Helping Crossers Not A Crime\n\nPeople in Arivaca who helped border crossers have gotten into trouble. In 2005, Daniel Strauss and Shanti Sellz were arrested. They were charged with smuggling. They had tried to drive three men to a hospital. A judge threw out the case a year later.\n\nAnd Daniel Millis was charged with littering. He had left big bottles of water for border crossers in the desert near Arivaca. A judge cleared him two years ago.\n\nSince then, there have been no arrests.\n\nJames Duff Lyall is a lawyer in Arizona. He tries to help people when their rights aren't respected. He says courts have decided that helping crossers is not a crime. He says people should know that.\n\nPeople \"should do what they think is the right thing to do,\" he says.'"

            "text": "b\"PITTSBURGH, Pa. - Archaeologists study ancient objects to learn about the past. Now, they have learned new things about the city Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They looked at what was buried under the city. They have found evidence that Native American traders lived on the side of an ancient river a thousand years ago. Now it is called the Allegheny River. Later, European settlers cut forests near where three large rivers meet. They also built settlements. \n\nOne hundred years after that, more immigrants, or people from other countries, arrived. They were not rich or poor. They became a middle class. These immigrants went on to run the city.\n\nCasey Campetti is an archaeologist. On Nov. 22, Campetti led a walking tour to look at archaeology in part of Pittsburgh. She pointed out new discoveries. They give evidence of what the city once was like.\n\n## Digging For Road Uncovers Treasures\n\nDuring the digging for a new road, about 18,000 artifacts were found. Artifacts are things used by humans long ago. Some artifacts found there include small houses. There were also outdoor bathrooms called outhouses. Archaeologists also found signs of where Native Americans lived for a short time, Campetti said.\n\nToday, cities pick up garbage at our homes. In the past, however, things that were not wanted were thrown into the outhouse. Today, those spots can show how things have changed over time. \n\nPeople have not been studying archaeology in cities very long. It became easier to do with new laws and rules at construction projects. The rules protected artifacts.\n\nArchaeologists do three things at construction areas, Campetti said. First, they look for any new discoveries. Second, they decide if a discovery is important. Finally, they decide what to do with important artifacts.\n\n## Native American Tools Found\n\nCity builders used to knock a building down and build a new one right over it, Campetti said. Now they are building much bigger buildings. For that, they have to dig a big hole. Archeologists are finding artifacts from many different parts of history in the holes, Campetti said.\n\nArchaeologists found children's toys, such as marbles and dolls. Nearby, they found stone tools and arrowheads. They said that Native Americans probably lived there briefly thousands of years ago.  \n\nIn the early 1800s, there was a big construction project. The Ohio, Monongahela and Allegheny rivers were moved higher. The entire downtown area of Pittsburgh also had to be made higher.\n\nArtifacts in that area were buried during the project, Campetti said.\n\n## Layers Show How Things Changed\n\nArchaeologists can look at layers of artifacts from different periods. The layers tell a story. They show how the middle class grew. Pieces of broken plates buried under bits of fine china might show how a neighborhood changed.\n\nOther artifacts were found before a building called 3 PNC Plaza was built. Construction workers dug 20 feet. They reached the area where downtown used to be. Artifacts found there are shown at the Fairmont Pittsburgh hotel built on the property.\n\nThe artifacts include dolls and china from stores, said hotel worker Juan Rojas. He said the hotel gives tours to show off the pieces. \n\nOther pieces were found near where a tunnel is being built. The people who lived in the area of the project were renters, Campetti said. If the renters had something valuable they might try to hide it, she said. Diggers found a little box. It held part of a handgun and a shaving razor with a fancy handle.\""

A good person, they believe, leaves good prints in the red dust.\n\nFour years ago, after Sebastian Watson got into trouble, his footsteps turned bad. The leaders of his community sent him off to Mount Theo. On the mountain, Peggy Brown and her husband care for kids in trouble.\n\n## Learning Around The Campfire\n\nShe made Watson healthy on the outside with good food and healthy living. She also worked to make him strong on the inside. She surrounded him with the ancient way of life of the Warlpiri. The tribe is one of the original peoples of Australia. They were there before white people came. The Warlpiri have deep ties to their land, family and to the spirit world.\n\nAfter he arrived at Mount Theo, Watson was asked to get wood for a campfire. He walked into the wilderness to find dry wood.\n\nAround the campfire, Brown taught the troubled kids about the Warlpiri way of life. She also talked about the things that hurt their people. She spoke about alcohol, drugs and violence.\n\n## \"You Are Gifted\"\n\nAt night, Watson said he heard a spirit talk to him. It said: \"You are gifted, you've got to use these gifts in a good way. Don't ruin these gifts with sorrow.\"\n\nAs he lay there, he felt the sadness and worry leave his body.\n\nWatson now works for the Warlpiri Youth Development Aboriginal Corporation. He helps troubled young people from his community.\n\nThe group began 20 years ago, when a drug problem swept the tribe. Young people began sniffing gasoline to escape their problems. Some were as young as 11. Sniffing gasoline is very dangerous. It can cause brain damage and even death. Elders became afraid that all their children would be lost to it. They feared the Warlpiri history and way of life would disappear.\n\n## Dangerous Drugs\n\nWhen the kids began sniffing gas, the leaders searched for them at night to take them home, they said. However, even after the children were brought home, the kids did not stop.\n\nThe leaders were desperate and called a meeting. That's when they decided to send the troubled kids to Mount Theo. The Walpiri believe the mountain has the ability to heal. The leaders wanted to heal them and teach them about being Warlpiri.\n\nEven with sending kids to Mount Theo, many Warlpiri children still have troubles.\n\nGeraldine Dixon works at Warlpiri Youth Development. Her voice is soft. She uses the same calm voice when dealing with kids in trouble.\n\n## Honey Ants? They're Yummy!\n\nWhen the rains come, the bush turns a soft gray-green. Honey ants burrow up seeking water. After the rains end, Dixon goes into the wilderness. She brings a group of girls who are having troubles.\n\nDixon shows them where to dig down to find honey ants. The ants' tails are filled with nectar and are the sweetest thing in the dry outback. Honey ants are important to the Warlpiri. They are at the center of the Warlpiri \"dreaming.\" The \"dreaming\" are the Warlpiri stories that explain life and how the world was created.\n\nThe girls suck the honey from the ants' yellow tails. The sweetness bursts on the girls tongues and helps the girls feel more hopeful and alive.'"

He was about to get on a plane for the first time.\n\nAs he stood in line, his mother reminded him that waiting is part of going to the airport. Tomas sometimes has trouble waiting quietly. He has autism. People with autism understand the world differently. Sometimes they do not know why things happen. It can be scary for them.\n\nTomas is just 7 years old. On this day, he and his brother, Mateo, who is 9, were going to get on a plane that was not really going to leave the airport, or even move. They were going to practice how to fly.\n\n## Wings For Autism Helps Out\n\nThe Harps were in a program called Wings for Autism. It teaches children with autism how to get on a plane. Fifty families were at the airport to practice.\n\nEverything about flying on an airplane can be hard to understand if you have autism. You have to wait in lines with hundreds of other people. Airports also have many strange and loud noises, like planes taking off.\n\nIt can be very scary for people with autism.\n\nJennifer Bishop was also at the airport with her son, Nathaniel Epstein, who is 14 years old. Nathaniel had been on a plane once before when he was 4. The trip was very hard because Nathaniel was scared. Ten years later, his mother was ready to try again.\n\nNathaniel can walk, but he spends most of his time in a wheelchair, Bishop said. This is because he gets scared in new places. If he gets fearful, he might sit down and decide not to move.\n\n## The Fastest Little Trip\n\nParents of autistic children say they do not often go to airports. Instead, they just drive everywhere. Tomas' mother, Carolina Harp, said she drives all over.\n\nShe even drives when she takes her sons on vacation. But this summer the family is going to California, which is all the way across the country. The trip will take days.\n\nHarp said she does not plan to drive that far, so her family must learn how to fly.\n\nThe airport was helpful on practice day. Families went through a special gate. They got on the plane and found their seats. They heard a talk about safety and were served pretzels and water.\n\nThey were back off the plane in a half-hour. It was the fastest little trip to nowhere.\n\nWings for Autism was very helpful for the parents and children.\n\nBishop learned a lot on the practice run. For example, she learned that getting on the plane was hard for Nathaniel. At first, he refused to get out of his wheelchair. He wanted his mom next to him, but she was behind him pushing the wheelchair.\n\nBishop decided to move around to the front of Nathaniel's chair so she could walk with him. Then the family went to the first seat of the plane and sat down. Nathaniel smiled. He had done it.\""

            "title": "Scientists learn more about how autism works in the brain",
            "text": "\tSAN JOSE, Calif. - Autism is usually thought of as a disorder. People who are autistic often have trouble talking to others. They may repeat things over and over, or be interested in only one subject.\n\nNow, though, a new study shows that autism may not be like other disorders. Instead, it may actually be a different way of thinking.\n\nScientists at Stanford University gave two groups of children math problems to solve. One group was autistic; the other was not. The children with autism turned out to have better math skills.\n\nThe scientists took pictures of the children's brains as they worked on the math problems. These showed differences, too. The children with autism used their brains in an unusual way.\n\n## Amazing Visual Memory\n\nThis new study shows something important. It makes us better understand the special talents that autistic people have, said Teresa Iuculano, the leader of the study. That may help children with autism have an easier time in school and, later, at work, she said. \"We think it could be reassuring for parents.\"\n\nThe children with autism had one problem all people with autism have. They had a hard time talking to other people. They could be very shy, and did not always understand what mood people were in. But they were very good at some things, said the team of scientists.\n\nThe autistic brain does not necessarily work less well than a normal brain, Iuculano said. Instead, it could just be \"a different brain.\"\n\nAutism comes in many forms. Some people with autism can have a lot of trouble even doing simple things. But others can have special skills or talents.\n\nThey may be very good at calendar calculation. This skill allows them to quickly figure out on which day of the week someone was born, once they know the year. Or they may have amazing visual memory. For example, they may remember how many windows are in a skyscraper they have only seen once.\n\n## Very Good At Math Problems\n\nBut the discovery of math talents in children with autism is particularly important.\n\n\"The study backs up what we already know. Some of these kids have great talents. But they look at the world differently,\" said Brad Boardman. He runs a San Jose center for people with autism.\n\nThere may be a simple reason for what the scientists found. Children with autism may be better at math just because they practice so much.\n\nBut the scientists believe there is more to it than that. They think the autistic brain works differently.\n\nTheir study looked at 36 children, ages 7 to 12. Half had autism. All had normal IQs.\n\nThe children with autism did much better on math tests than the others. Most scored around 125 on the tests. The children who were not autistic scored an average 100.\n\n## Thinking Things Differently\n\nThe children with autism also solved math problems in a different way. Non-autistic children counted on their fingers or memorized answers. Children with autism broke the problem down into parts. For instance, if they were asked how much 7 plus 4 was, they would add 7 plus 3, then add 1.\n\nThe scientists used a scanner to take pictures of what was going on inside the children's brains. The scans of the children with autism showed something unusual. When they worked on math problems, they used a part of a brain just below the ears. This area is known as the ventral temporal occipital cortex.\n\nNormally, that part of the brain is used to figure out things we see, including faces. Maybe because the children with autism use it on math, it makes them less able to read people's expressions. That could explain why they are not good at figuring out people's moods.\n\nThe different way the children with autism use their brains might help strong skills develop, like problem-solving, \"even though there are things that they may not be good at,\" Iuculano said.'"

Strudel, a baked dessert, is one of the most popular items with his customers.\n\nWhen he was a young man, he survived World War II. It was one of the worst wars in history. In 1939, Germany started attacking neighboring countries. Over the next few years, the country conquered most of Europe. Everywhere they went, the Germans captured Jews. They were sent to work camps and millions were killed.\n\nThe Germans who ran the camps were called Nazis.\n\n## \"Baking Saved My Life\"\n\nThe Nazis killed more than 30 people in Feld's family. He survived, however. He became a prisoner at a Nazi camp and was forced to work as a cook. Because they liked his food, the Nazis did not kill him.\n\n\"Baking saved my life,\" Feld said. \"If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead.\"\n\nFeld was born in 1925 in Czechoslovakia. It was a country next to Germany. Feld's father died in an accident when he was young. His mother, Sara, supported their family by running a restaurant.\n\nFeld grew up watching her bake. Soon, he followed in her footsteps.\n\n\"When I was 14, I was always licking this and licking that,\" he remembered. \"Mother would say, 'Are you eating again? I'm going to send you to baker's school.'\"\n\nHe worked as a baker for the next three years. Then war broke out in 1939. In 1942, three years after they invaded Czechoslovakia, Nazi soldiers began rounding up Jews. The Jews were sent to camps, where millions were murdered or forced to work.\n\nFeld was just 17 years old. He was sent by train to Hungary. There, he worked as a cook at a farm camp. Then a Nazi leader heard he was a baker. The Nazi leader needed a baker to cook for German officers at a new airport they were building. \"He asked me, 'What can you cook?'\" Feld remembered.\n\n## Working In The Kitchen\n\nFeld was chosen for the job. Over the following months, he cooked for German officers. They liked his food. His poppy-seed strudels were especially popular.\n\nFeld asked if some of the other Jewish prisoners could work with him in the kitchen. This would keep them from having to do more difficult and dangerous jobs for the Nazis. He remembers how he and the other cooks used to bake together, feeling lucky to be alive.\n\nBy 1945, the war had turned against the Germans. The Nazis were on the run. Feld escaped and was saved by Russian soldiers. When he made it back home, he learned that his mother and younger brother, Alex, had been killed. Cousins, aunts and uncles had died, too.\n\n## Sweet Taste Of Success\n\nFeld eventually made his way to the San Francisco area, where he kept baking.\n\nNow, at age 90, he is slowing down. His wife, Marika, does the baking. Since breaking his leg five months ago, he often uses a walker and wheelchair.\n\nAs Feld opened a box of old pictures, Marika whispered something to him in Hungarian.\n\n\"She wants me to say that those Nazis are probably dead, but Ernie is still making his poppy-seed strudels,\" Feld translated. He was smiling.'"

Then he speed-walks toward his work table.\n\nMcDonough's boss at the bakery asked him about his weekend. He responded with short one-word answers. He barely looked her in the eye. That was fine with his boss, Jean Kroll. She owns the Sugar & Spice Extraordinary Sweet Treats bakery.\n\nFor the rest of his workday, the quiet, dark-haired 27-year-old moved quickly. He boxed cakes, stacked them on a hand cart and labeled them for shipment. When he finished, he carefully swept the floor.\n\n## \"It's Nice, But It's Also Smart\"\n\nMcDonough has autism. Autism affects a person's social skills and ability to communicate. Many people with autism do not work. The fact that he has a job at the bakery is \"probably a miracle,\" he said.\n\n\"It feels as happy as can be,\" McDonough added.\n\nThis past summer, McDonough and two other men with autism arrived at the bakery. They learned to measure sugar and package cakes. As they did, a student from Northwestern University carefully checked how much work they got done. The student wanted to figure out if it made good business sense to hire a worker with a disability like autism.\n\nFor Kroll, that was an important question.\n\nSmall businesses need their workers to be able to do the job, she said. They can't afford to hire an employee just to help him.\n\nThe story of how she offered jobs to the three men with autism is one of luck and goodwill. It was also, according to Kroll, a good business decision.\n\nPeople always tell Kroll \"That's such a nice thing to do.\" Kroll answers them, \"Yes it is nice, but it's also a smart thing to do.\"\n\n## Helping Those With Autism Have Dreams\n\nTwo years ago, Kroll's bakery moved near an organization called Have Dreams. The group helps people with autism.\n\nShortly after the move, Kroll heard that people with autism needed job training. She invited five men with autism to help her put together cookie boxes.\n\nFor a year and a half, they came every week.\n\nThere was a tall, blond-haired man named Zach, who loved to talk and ask questions. Michael was playful and made jokes. Jimmy could put labels on boxes as fast as anyone.\n\nOne day, someone at Have Dreams asked if Kroll might have other jobs for them.\n\nKroll's answer was a definite \"No.\"\n\n## Having A Job \"Feels Fabulous\"\n\nAfter she went home that night, she was angry at herself for saying that. She and Have Dreams came up with a job training program at the bakery.\n\nThey hope it will be successful. If it is, other businesses could be convinced to hire people with disabilities.\n\nOn June 24, three men arrived at the bakery. By the end of the six weeks, they worked almost as quickly as a regular bakery worker. Kroll decided that she could start offering them jobs.\n\nNow, McDonough spends his days among the huge kettles of buttery toffee.\n\nHaving a job, he said, \"feels fabulous.\"\n\n## Doing The Right Thing\n\nAfter the workday ended, Kroll stood in the bakery. A pile of orders for cookies and cakes were in her hand. \"It was a great day. A really nice, regular day,\" she said.\n\nMcDonough is a great worker. What's more, she said, he has helped her business get bigger. As he develops more skills, she said, he will earn raises \"just like everyone else.\"\n\n\"This is a good business decision,\" she said. It just so happens, she added, that hiring people with autism is the right thing to do.'"

It has four final choices of women to go on the $20 bill. Right now there are no women on U.S. paper money.\n\nFour women were chosen: Eleanor Roosevelt, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and Wilma Mankiller. Eleanor Roosevelt was a first lady. She did a lot to help other people. Harriet Tubman fought against slavery. Rosa Parks was a civil rights activist. She fought for the rights of black Americans. Wilma Mankiller was the first woman elected chief of a big Native American tribe.\n\nPeople can now vote for one of the four.\n\n## The Trail Of Tears\n\nThe group originally had a list of 100 names. The list then became 60. They asked people what they thought. Then the list was pushed down to 30 people. Experts on women's history helped pick 15 women from the list.\n\nPeople on the list of 15 included Susan B. Anthony. She fought for women to get the right to vote. Women won the right to vote in 1920. Before then, only men could vote.\n\nThe Women on 20s group said that Roosevelt, Tubman and Parks received the most votes. Mankiller was not the list of 15 that the public voted on. The group said she was selected for the final four because a lot of people asked for her. People really wanted to be able to choose a Native American to take Jackson's place, the group said.\n\nPresident Jackson helped pass laws that forced Native Americans to leave their lands. They had to go far away. The forced moving of the Native Americans is known as the Trail of Tears. This is one reason why the group wants to change the $20.\n\nThe year 2020 will also be 100 years since the 19th Amendment was passed. The change to the Constitution allowed women to vote.\n\n## No Change Since 1929\n\nSusan Ades Stone is in charge of Women on 20s.

They also seemed like \"heroes,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury is in charge of printing money. The person who runs the Treasury is called the treasury secretary. He is supposed to chose the pictures of people that will appear on money.\n\nStone said the group wants to talk to the president instead. She hopes to talk to the White House in the next few weeks. The group thinks that getting the president involved will bring more attention to replacing Jackson on the $20 bill..\n\nThe person who wins the group's vote will not necessarily be the person on the bill, Stone said. If the White House and Treasury like the idea, groups of other people would choose who would be on the bill. They would also choose what the money would look like.\n\nThe men featured on current U.S. bills have not changed for a long time. The last time there was a change was in 1929.'"

The people could be killed by the Islamic fighters if they come down from the mountain. They could also die without the food and water.\n\n\"Today America is coming to help,\" he said on Thursday.\n\nU.S. troops left Iraq in 2011. The United States has not gotten this involved in Iraq since then. Obama wants to be remembered as the president who ended what he has called the \"dumb war\" in Iraq.\n\n## Yazidis Told To Convert Or Die\n\nThe main religion in Iraq is Islam. The Yazidis follow an older religion.\n\nThe fighters are part of a group called the Islamic State. They ordered the Yazidis to make a choice. They could join Islam, pay money, flee their homes or face death. The Yazidis ran away.\n\nObama said the Iraqi government requested the food and water. The Islamic State group is fighting against Iraq's government. They are also fighting the government in Syria. They want to take control of both countries.\n\nObama said that new U.S. attacks in Iraq could worry Americans. He promised not to put American soldiers back on the ground in Iraq.\n\nEven so, he explained the Islamic State fighters might attack the city of Irbil. Then U.S. fighter jets might be needed. Irbil is in northern Iraq. Americans working for the U.S. government and army are based there.\n\n\"When the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action,\" Obama said. \"That's my responsibility as commander in chief.\"\n\n## A Life-Saving Mission\n\nThe U.S. military said planes have dropped food and water in the area.\n\nThey delivered 5,300 gallons of fresh drinking water. They also dropped 8,000 packaged meals to the stranded people.\n\nThe president said the life-saving mission was America's duty.\n\nThe U.S. was prepared to make more airdrops if needed, officials said. They did not say how quickly they would happen.\n\nOfficials said the U.S. military was flying over Irbil. Some of the flights are in traditional aircraft.

Lawmakers from Congress left Washington, D.C., last week. They are on a five-week vacation called a recess. There was no sign that Congress was being called back to work.\n\nHowever, officials said the White House was talking with some lawmakers.

Their population grew faster in the South than any other part of the country. The government collected these numbers in a count of the country's population.\n\nThe South includes 16 states from Maryland to Florida to Texas. Washington, D.C., is also included in the region. In some states the Asian-American population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010. Georgia and North Carolina grew the fastest.\n\n## They Grew Fast, Now What?\n\nThe sudden growth presents some problems in the states. Problems with new languages are one example.\n\nCommunities now have to teach students who do not speak English as a first language. There are 111 different languages in one part of Georgia.\n\nSome cities also want Asian-American businesses to have signs in English. It would help police go to the right place in an emergency.\n\nOfficials also have to write papers in different languages to help refugees. Also, some states in the South are not used to dealing with large groups of people from other countries.\n\nAn older Asian-American population is another challenge. Experts say the number of elderly Asian-Americans in the region is increasing. The cheaper cost of living draws them to the South after they stop working. Since they are older, they need more health care. States will have to deal with that.\n\nThe Asian-American newcomers also mean new voters in the South. Almost three times as many Asian-Americans voted in Virginia in 2012, compared with 2004.\n\n## Many Opportunities Are There\n\nThere are many reasons for the population shift. Many different groups of Asian-Americans are moving to the South. Groups of Chinese, Indians, Koreans and Vietnamese are just some of them. The government tracks 23 different ethnic groups that it considers Asian-American.\n\nIt's hard to find one explanation for the changes. Marita Etcubanez works for an Asian-American group. She says many move to the South to find better jobs. It can also be cheaper to live in the South.\n\nPeople will move where there are good opportunities, Etcubanez said. Different people will have different opportunities. Refugees from parts of Southeast Asia will have different skills than an educated worker from India.\n\nC.N. Le, a college professor, mentioned good universities in North Carolina as a draw for educated Asian-Americans. That state had the highest increase in its Asian-American population in the region.\n\nSome states will adjust to new communities better than others. Some states, like Tennessee, have accepted refugees for many years. They might adapt better to a changing population.\n\nThis is a new situation for many states, said Chris Kromm, a civil rights worker. \"A lot of them are catching up.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Jay-Z and Beyonce's trip to Cuba four weeks ago got people talking. Americans are not allowed to freely visit the island. But now more people are interested in going there on a cultural tour.\n\nInsight Cuba says its bookings are way up since the couple's April tour. Insight Cuba is the first and largest Cuba tour group.\n\n\"It's had a huge impact. Everything from our call center to our website to our blog to our Facebook page just lit up,\" said Tom Popper. He's the president of Insight Cuba. \"People were Googling it and curious.\"\n\nThe rapper/singer celebrity couple are making a growing travel sensation even more popular. There is demand to visit Cuba. It's an exotic land that's changed little in years. It lies just 93 miles from the Florida coast. Yet few Americans have ever reached its shores.\n\n## Tight Restrictions On Travel\n\nThe two countries have been at odds for a long time since Cuba had a revolution. Americans are not allowed to do business with Cuba. That makes visiting Cuba really hard. Americans may travel to Cuba. The rules don't make it easy though. Going without the proper permissions can run the risk of a huge fine. The rules are less strict for Cuban-Americans.\n\nRoughly 400,000 Cuban-Americans went to Cuba last year. President Barack Obama changed a rule in 2009. Unlimited visits to family members are now allowed.\n\nCultural tours of Cuba for groups were allowed in 2011. But they must be licensed by the U.S. government. The idea was to let Americans meet Cubans. The hope was that closer relations would bring more democracy to the Caribbean nation.\n\nJay-Z and Beyonce's high-profile adventure was criticized by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and other Cuban-American leaders. But others in Congress want to make it easier for Americans to visit Cuba.\n\nAbout 90,000 Americans made these \"people-to-people\" visits last year. That's up slightly over previous years. Insight Cuba expects 5,000 more customers this year. In 2012, it had 3,000.\n\n## No Day At The Beach\n\nBut the rules are strict for these tours. That includes the three-day one taken by Beyonce and Jay-Z. Rubio and others demanded these tours stick to serious activities. These must include visits to senior centers, schools and artist studios.\n\nIt's no day at the beach.\n\nBeyonce and Jay-Z celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on the trip. They reportedly stuck to the plan of the tour. They visited a school, a children's theater group and a jazz club. The pair also met with Cuban musicians.\n\nRubio and people who support the ban say these trips give money to the Cuban government. The government restricts the Cuban people's freedom. That's why Rubio and others even want to limit family visits to the island.\n\nPutting together tours is now more difficult. \"Every day has to be chock-full of approved activities, pretty much from 9 to 5,\" Popper said.\n\n\"Not everybody wants to travel that way,\" he admitted.\n\n## Making Travel Easier\n\nBut, Popper said, Beyonce and Jay-Z's trip helped Cuban travel. It made Americans aware that they can visit Cuba legally.\n\nFifty-nine Democrats in the U.S. House want to make travel to Cuba easier. They wrote Obama in April and urged him to let people go to Cuba on their own without prior approval. Visitors could book their trip through a special airline, as Cuban-Americans do now. They'd sign a statement proving they have a good reason to go.\n\nThe White House has not responded. It has been slow to make more changes in policy. That's until Cuba releases Alan Gross, of Maryland. He was jailed there in December 2009. He allegedly brought satellite-communications equipment to the island.\n\nBut some people hope changes in Cuba will further loosen U.S. travel rules. Such changes include a new rule that allows Cubans to leave the island without asking first.\n\n\"The Cuban government remains repressive. They have serious human rights issues,\" said U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, after returning from Havana in April. But, she said, \"We need to try something new.\"'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - China and Japan have been arguing for years over some tiny islands in the East China Sea. They are fighting about who owns the islands.\n\nOn Nov. 23, China set up a restricted flying zone over the islands. It said any planes that want to fly over the zone must first tell China their plans.\n\nThis made Japan nervous. The Japanese worry China is trying to take greater control of the region.\n\nOn Wednesday, China said the United States was taking Japan's side. The United States has refused to accept the zone.\n\n## Biden Meets With China's President\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden was in China on Wednesday. He was meeting with the country's leaders. But Biden did not publicly ask China to change its mind about the zone. He did not want to make demands that China was likely to ignore.\n\nBut he did hope to convince China's leaders not to do anything if planes fly through the zone. He also hoped to get China to agree not to set up similar zones over other territories.\n\nBiden had a private meeting with President Xi Jinping. The meeting went a lot longer than scheduled. When he came out, Biden appeared serious and quiet. He spoke briefly with reporters. But he did not discuss details on differences over the restricted flying zone. Instead he spoke about major countries working together. U.S.-China relations depend on trust, he said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Biden met with young Chinese. They were waiting to get travel papers processed at the U.S. Embassy. He urged them to challenge the way things are.\n\nNeither Biden nor Xi talked publicly about the islands. But the China Daily said that Japan was trying to make China angry. It said Washington was ignoring this. China Daily is a newspaper run by the Chinese government.\n\n## An Important Relationship\n\nBiden spoke to reporters after his first talks with Xi. He said that the relationship between China and the United States will matter a lot in the current century. Anything can happen if the U.S. and China can get that relationship right, he said.\n\nBiden said Xi was open and constructive. Openness leads to trust,  Biden said. \"Trust is the basis on which real change - constructive change - is made.\"\n\nThe two leaders had a second meeting. More people were to be involved in that meeting.\n\nBiden did not say anything public about U.S. concerns over China's new air defense zone.  But on Tuesday, Biden promised to talk about the concerns with Xi and other Chinese leaders.\n\nChina's move \"increased the risk\" that something bad could happen by accident. Biden said that Tuesday in Tokyo. He met there with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.\n\nAfter meeting with Biden, Xi said the U.S.-China relationship had gotten off to a good start this year. But he said the situation in the world is changing. Tougher challenges and regional problems keep coming up, he said.\n\nHe also said that the United States and China carry important responsibilities for upholding peace. '"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - They tried to stop him. But Harry S. McAlpin made history anyway.\n\nIn February of 1944, McAlpin achieved a breakthrough: He became the first black journalist to report on a presidential news conference at the White House.\n\nPresidential news conferences are a big deal: At them, the president of the United States speaks to a select group of reporters. They are allowed to ask him questions.\n\nTime magazine and The New York Times noted the breakthrough. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt greeted the reporter: \"Glad to see you, McAlpin,\" he said.\n\n## Blocking Black Reporters\n\nBut McAlpin's fellow reporters did not show him the same friendliness. They were members of the White House Correspondents' Association, or WHCA. The WHCA controlled which reporters could work at the White House. For 10 years, that group had blocked black reporters from the White House.\n\nMcAlpin was only there because Roosevelt had invited black reporters to attend. African-American newspapers had been asking him to let them in since 1933.\n\nRoosevelt's invitation did nothing to change the thinking of WHCA members. One member suggested to McAlpin that if he did attend, \"someone\" could get hurt. If McAlpin stayed away, though, he'd share his notes with him.\n\nMcAlpin \"ever so politely declined the offer,\" said reporter George Condon. Instead, he stepped boldly into the White House.\n\nThese days, the WHCA is looking to make up for its past mistakes: It is setting aside money for black students who want to study journalism in college. They will receive a scholarship in McAlpin's name. McAlpin will be honored by the WHCA on May 3.\n\n\"Harry McAlpin was a remarkable man,\" said Steven Thomma. He is the current president of the WHCA.\n\nThanks to Harry McAlpin, and others who followed, the WHCA today has many kinds of faces and voices, Thomma said. \"The country is better for it.\"\n\n## Facing Discrimination\n\nMcAlpin's son, Sherman, is proud of what his father did.\n\n\"He has been and continues to be my hero,\" Sherman said of his father.\n\nMcAlpin faced much discrimination, his son said. As a young man, McAlpin hoped to study journalism at the University of Missouri. He was barred because of his race. McAlpin ended up at the University of Wisconsin instead.\n\nSimilarly, trying to get into the White House as a black reporter was a \"hard road,\" Sherman said. His father told him of the warning he had received: Show up at the White House, and \"someone might step on your foot.\" Then, a fight would break out.\n\nMcAlpin replied: \"I always thought the White House press would be the cream of the crop. I can't imagine that would happen. But if it did, it would be the story of the year and I wouldn't want to miss it.' \"\n\nMcAlpin achieved another first: He was part of the press train traveling to the 1944 Democratic National Convention. He was also one of the few reporters allowed to report on the White House funeral services when Roosevelt died.\n\nAnd McAlpin made his mark with President Harry S. Truman: At the new president's first news conference, McAlpin asked a bold question: Could Truman promise African-Americans he'd consider their views as Roosevelt had?\n\n## \"To Pray For Wisdom\"\n\n\"He was a good writer,\" Condon said. And he was \"a good reporter who paid attention to what his community cared about.\"\n\nBut McAlpin was never invited to join the WHCA.\n\n\"The president could break the color line for his press conferences,\" Condon said. However, he couldn't change the WHCA.\n\nMcAlpin stopped attending White House press conferences in 1945. He later served as a war reporter before moving to Kentucky. There, he worked as a lawyer. McAlpin worked on civil rights as president of the Louisville NAACP.\n\nSherman said that his father had taught him that all men were created equal. Nonetheless, his father often had to struggle against the racism of others.\n\nDuring the 1950s, McAlpin spoke of his struggles with racism.\n\n\"I have found it necessary to develop patience, to build courage, to pray for wisdom,\" McAlpin said.'"

Now people around the world are demanding their release. They are speaking out on social media using the Twitter hashtag \"#BringBackOurGirls.\"\n\nThe kidnappers are from a group called Boko Haram. The group released a video it said was of the girls.\n\nThe video showed more than 100 girls. Some of the girls were praying, saying they had converted to Islam from Christianity.\n\nThe girls' parents desperately searched the video on Tuesday. They were looking for the faces of their daughters, who had been kidnapped at school. But while one mother recognized her daughter, many others did not.\n\n## A Long Struggle\n\nNigeria has been struggling for years with Boko Haram. The group's name means \"Western education is a sin.\" It wants to force strict Islamic laws on Nigerians living in the northeastern part of the country.\n\nNigerian newspapers reported that some parents doubted the video released by the kidnappers. They said that some of those pictured in long dark hijabs didn't look like teenage students. They looked more like adults in their 30s and 40s.\n\nMallam Zannah Chibok told a Nigerian newspaper that he could not identify his kidnapped daughters in the video. Other parents agreed. Many said they couldn't find their daughters either.\n\nDumoma Mpur is the head of the parent-teachers association of the school where the girls were kidnapped. Mpur told another newspaper that one mother recognized her child.\n\n## Parents Say Government Didn't Listen\n\nIn the video, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau spoke. Shekau said he was willing to make a deal. He would give back some of the girls but only if Nigeria let go some of the Boko Haram prisoners.\n\nThe Nigerian government has said it will do everything necessary to free the girls. But it did not say whether it would release prisoners to the terror group.\n\nParents of the girls have complained about the way the government handled the kidnapping. They say the government didn't act on their reports. Some parents tried to tell them where they thought the gunmen were holding the girls.\n\nIt took weeks for President Goodluck Jonathan to respond to the kidnapping. He only spoke out after an global Twitter campaign took off. The tweets asked him to \"#BringBackOurGirls.\" The campaign had been supported by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. Famous actors and actresses participated as well.\n\n## Kidnappings Might Not End\n\nSome say that releasing Boko Haram prisoners would only lead to more kidnappings. But it would be challenging for the government to rescue the prisoners without risking a lot of bloodshed. The choice leaves Jonathan's government in an uncomfortable position.\n\nIn the video, Shekau said he carried out the kidnappings in revenge. He said it was because Nigeria imprisoned members and friends of Boko Haram. He said his group was holding many other people but gave no number.'"

Now, far fewer children are crossing the border without permission.\n\nEven so, it seems the government will continue to fight over immigration anyway.\n\nOn Friday, President Barack Obama said he would order changes to some immigration rules. The rules say who can come and stay in the United States.\n\nNo one knows exactly what changes Obama would make. More than 11 million people are living in the United States without permission. Experts think he may protect more than 5 million of them from being sent back to their home countries.\n\n## The Gloves Are Coming Off\n\nRepublican lawmakers have promised to fight. They think lawmakers should be the ones to decide whether the people can stay or not. They say an order by Obama would cause the new Congress to not trust him. Lawmakers in the Senate and the House of Representatives form Congress. The two groups make the laws for the United States.\n\nIn elections earlier in November, Republicans won control over both houses of Congress. The Republicans are a political group. They disagree with Obama, a Democrat, over running the country. They especially do not agree with him over the millions of people in the United States without permission.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers mostly say the illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay. Republican lawmakers argue that border security must be tightened first. They want to stop people from coming into the United States without permission.\n\n## Fewer Children Picked Up At The Border\n\nOn Friday, the government announced that far fewer children are crossing the border on their own. For every five children who tried to cross the border in October of 2013, there were only three who tried to cross in October this year.\n\nThe number of families trying to come to the United States illegally also decreased.\n\nThe numbers have been going down for some time, said Jeh Johnson. He is a government leader. His job is to help keep the United States safe. Johnson is also in charge of protecting the borders.\n\nThe number of illegal immigrants is at its lowest level since the 1970s, Johnson said.\n\nThe government accomplished this in several ways. Hundreds of border guards were moved to the Rio Grande Valley. The valley is in Texas. It runs along the border with Mexico. The government also tried to stop criminal gangs from sneaking people to the United States. It added more flights to send people back.\n\nIn October, the number of children trying to come on their own was the lowest in two years. Over the summer, most of the children came from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in Central America. They were trying to join family members in the United States, Johnson said. They also came for a better life.\n\n## President Says He Will Use His Powers\n\nMore than a year ago, The Senate passed an important bill. It would have let people work here legally and visit their home countries. However, the House of Representatives never voted on the bill, so it did not become law.\n\nOn Friday, Obama said since Congress did not do anything, he would use his powers fix the problem. He said he would \"try to make the system work better.\"\n\nObama promised he would take action by the end of the year.\n\nRepublicans are angry about Obama's promise.\n\nWe are going to fight the president if he does this, said Representative John Boehner. He is a Republican from Ohio. This is the wrong way to govern, Boehner said.'"

He spoke at a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia,  on Thursday. If not, it could mean the end of the Scouts.\n\nTwo years ago, the Boy Scouts said gay young people could join the Scouts. Adults who are gay still are not allowed to be leaders. Gay people are attracted to people of their own sex.\n\n## The Military Changed Too\n\n\"We must deal with the world as it is, not as we might wish it would be,\" said Gates. He was once the U.S. secretary of defense. He was in charge when the U.S. military decided to let gay people serve as soldiers. Before, gay people were by law not allowed to become soldiers.\n\nGates' speech comes at an important time for the Boy Scouts. There is a lot of pressure on it to change. Gay rights supporters were pleased by Gates' speech. It sent a signal that the Boy Scouts would allow gay leaders soon. Perhaps, it could happen within the year, they said.\n\nThe Boy Scouts have not permitted gay leaders in part because of religious groups. Some groups believe that gays are forbidden by the Bible. Churches sponsor Scout troops. More than half of the Boy Scouts belong to troops connected to a church.\n\n## Making Both Sides Happy\n\nGates said every Boy Scout group should make its own decision about gay leaders. His solution may make both sides happy. It would please those who want to allow gay leaders. At the same time, groups that do not want gay leaders would not have to have them.\n\nThe Boy Scouts may face lawsuits around the country involving gay leaders. Lawsuits are challenges in courts. Some Scout leaders were fired because they were gay. Others could not get a job. They may ask judges to force the Scouts to change their rules on gay leaders.\n\nPascal Tessier is a gay Scout leader in New York. The scouting troop hired him there even though it isn't allowed. He has hired lawyers in case he is fired.\n\n## Suing The Scouts\n\nHis lawyers have already started a court case against the Denver Boy Scouts over gay leaders. There are also cases in Ohio, Oklahoma and other states, said Josh Schiller. He is one of the lawyers for Tessier.\n\nNext month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide whether same-sex couples can marry. Same-sex marriage is when two men or two women get married. It is also called gay marriage. More and more, gay rights and same-sex marriage have been accepted in America.\n\n## Scouts For Equality\n\nThere are people in the Boy Scouts who also do not like the rule about gay leaders. Twenty Boy Scout councils have passed rules allowing gay leaders, said Zach Wahls. He is the head of Scouts for Equality. The group works for gay rights within the Boy Scouts.\n\nOn Thursday, Gates made another important announcement. He said the Boy Scouts would not punish local councils that hire gay leaders. He said that the Scouts must not avoid the issue.\n\n\"The one thing we cannot do is put our heads in the sand and pretend this challenge will go away,\" Gates said. \"Quite the opposite is happening.\"'"

On Tuesday, she called it off.\n\nPresident Dilma Rousseff is angry that the United States spied on her and other Brazilian officials. She made that clear when she canceled the meeting. It was another sign that Brazil and the White House are growing apart.\n\nA White House spokesman said both sides made the decision to delay the meeting. He wanted to make it seem like it was not a big deal. But it was an insult. And it came from an important U.S. friend and business partner, Latin America's biggest country.\n\nThe White House said that Rousseff and Obama agreed it would be better to have the visit later. It could happen when the two nations were getting along better.\n\n## Snowden Leak Sours Relations\n\nObama \"understands and regrets\" the concern in Brazil, the White House said.\n\nA statement from the Brazilian president's office was tougher. The U.S. had not explained the spying or agreed it would stop. That's why the visit was canceled, Brazil said.\n\nBrazil said spying was not something that countries do to their friends.\n\nThere have been three news reports in Brazil based on top secret papers since July. The information was leaked by Edward Snowden. He used to work on computers at the National Security Agency. The NSA is part of the U.S. government. One report said that the agency had intercepted communications between Rousseff and her staff. The NSA also spied on other senior officials, the report said.\n\nRousseff quickly blasted the eavesdropping.\n\n## U.S. Tries To Ease Tension ...\n\nObama tried to make things better. He added a meeting with Rousseff to his schedule at a gathering of top countries in Russia earlier this month. He offered to address her concerns. National security adviser Susan Rice met with her Brazilian counterpart last week.\n\nBut it did not work. The two leaders spoke by phone Monday. They agreed to delay the visit. A state visit has a lot of ceremony. They did not want one issue between the countries to get all the attention, \"no matter how important or challenging the issue may be,\" the White House said.\n\nSnowden had already led to another canceled meeting. Only then it was Obama doing the canceling.\n\nHe had planned to meet in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month. But then Putin let Snowden stay in Russia temporarily. So Obama canceled the meeting.\n\nBut the two leaders met informally later in St. Petersburg. Both governments have since worked together. They have agreed on a plan to take away Syria's chemical weapons.\n\n## ... But Brazil Balks Big Brother\n\nRousseff's was the only state visit planned for this year. It was supposed to be big for Brazil. It was seen as showing that the country was becoming more important. But Rousseff appears to have decided that scolding Washington over spying was more important to Brazilians than a sit-down in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Slapping Obama in the face, standing up to the big neighbor in the North\" could make her more popular, said David Fleischer of the University of Brasilia. Rousseff faces elections next year.\n\n\"The issue of spying would have dominated the Washington visit,\" said Peter Hakim. He is president emeritus at the Inter-American Dialogue. The Washington group focuses on relations with Latin America. Rousseff must have also been worried that another Snowden leak could come before the meeting, he said.\n\nRousseff plans to speak about spying next week at the United Nations.\n\nThe cancellation could affect U.S. businesses. A big contract to sell Boeing aircraft was probably going to be discussed at the state meeting. So was letting U.S. companies work Brazilian oil fields, said Carl Meacham. He runs the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"This signals a different kind of environment for the U.S.,\" said Meacham.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - During his first term, President Obama rarely talked about race. On Thursday, though, he did. Speaking at the White House, he unveiled a new program. Its aim is to help a group he says badly needs attention: black and Latino young men.\n\nThe new program is known as My Brother's Keeper. A key part of its mission is to find groups and programs already helping young minority men. The best of these, Obama said, should get government support. Programs must have successfully helped minority youth stay out of trouble, succeed in school or land good jobs.\n\nThe \"urgency of the situation,\" Obama said, requires us to get \"something done.\" We must figure out \"what works,\" he added.\n\nThe new program was partly inspired by two meetings Obama had with the Chicago group Becoming a Man. Those meetings meant a lot to the president. It also had a deep effect on the group's young African-American men. The last time they saw the president, they presented him with a Father's Day card in the Oval Office. Their gift left the president speechless.\n\n## A Helping Hand\n\nAt Thursday's event, Obama was introduced by Christian Champagne. The 18-year-old goes to Hyde Park Academy High School. Champagne said he had been coasting along with B's and C's before hearing the president talk about his own struggles as a young man. Obama grew up without a father at home. Now, Champagne said, he earns A's and B's. And he plans to go to college.\n\n\"I felt the flame in me,\" he said. \"I wanted to be more.\"\n\nThe announcement comes two years after the shooting of Trayvon Martin. The black Florida teenager's death led to some of the president's most personal remarks on race. And it pushed him to think about how he could help. \"If I had a son,\" Obama said then, \"he'd look like Trayvon.\" Martin's parents were at Thursday's White House event.\n\nLast year, Obama had his first meeting with the boys of Becoming a Man. He met them at their school, Hyde Park Academy High. The school is only about a mile from Obama's South Side Chicago home. That closeness reminded him of his similarity to the students. Like them, he is African-American. Growing up, he could have experienced the same difficulties they have - difficulties experienced by many young black men in America.\n\nThings could have turned out differently for Obama, said Valerie Jarrett. She's an adviser to Obama. Suppose he had grown up in Chicago, she said. \"He might have not had the same opportunities he had.\"\n\n## \"Put On Your A-Game\"\n\nAfter those two meetings, Obama began thinking more about the problems of African-American boys. He decided he had to do something to help.\n\nThe result is My Brother's Keeper. Its goal is to make the best use of money the government already has. It will also raise money from outside the government.\n\nAt least $200 million has already been pledged by charities. It will be directed at education and finding young men jobs, among other things.\n\nThe new push may not solve the big problems of race. But the president has seen personal results already. They've come out of his meetings with the Becoming a Man group.\n\n\"I think the president's getting as much out of this as they are,\" said Anthony Ramirez-Di Vittorio, who founded Becoming a Man. \"This is not a political moment. This is a moment of fatherliness.\"\n\nA year ago, Obama sat down with a dozen young men for their weekly \"check-in circle\" at their school. Last summer, he invited them to his own circle: the Oval Office.\n\n\"It has definitely given me motivation,\" said Kerron Turner, a 19-year-old senior. \"Having the president there, talking to you ... it makes you want to put on your A-game.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The United States government runs on a calendar that ends on September 30. After that, Congress has to pass laws to pay for the government.\n\nThe deadline to pass those laws this year is midnight Monday. If they are not passed, parts of the government will shut down. Right now it looks like the shutdown will happen. It would affect many things, from national parks to the military. It would be the first shutdown in 17 years.\n\nDemocrats are blaming the Republicans. Republicans say it's the Democrats who are at fault.\n\nThe root of the disagreement is a new health care law. Republicans do not like the law which many people call Obamacare.\n\n## House Wants To Delay Part Of Obamacare\n\nThe Republicans run the House of Representatives. It approved a new plan on Sunday. The plan would have delayed a key part of the health care law by a year. It also would have gotten rid of a tax on medical devices. In return, a shutdown would have been avoided. President Barack Obama and the leader of the Senate said the plan was no good. The Senate is controlled by the Democrats.\n\nThe White House said it would not approve the plan. It also said Republicans were \"pushing the government toward shutdown.\"\n\nLawmakers from each side spoke on the Sunday talk shows. They did not seem to be talking to each other. They repeated the same old arguments about the health care law. They talked right over one another.\n\n\"I agree we should have this debate, but we shouldn't connect it to a government shutdown,\" said Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia. That is the biggest disagreement between the two sides, he said.\n\nThe House's vote was 231-192. Almost everybody voted with their political party. Now the action moves to the Senate.\n\n## Only A Partial Shutdown On Tuesday\n\nNot everything would shut down Tuesday morning. Some important services would keep running. Among them are border patrols, meat inspection and air traffic control. Retired people would be paid. Health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.\n\nThe Senate was not scheduled to meet until midafternoon Monday. There will be just 10 hours before a shutdown would begin. Even some Republicans said privately that they thought Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had an advantage because of the timing.\n\nIf so, the House Republican members would have a choice to make. Do they cause a shutdown or come away empty-handed from their latest battle with Obama? Keep in mind that several Republican members are supported by the anti-government tea party.\n\n\"We will not shut the government down,\" said Kevin McCarthy of California. He is the No. 3 Republican in the House. Republicans will bargain \"a little longer\" if they need to, he said. He did not explain what he meant.\n\nHe suggested the House would \"get back together in enough time\" and send the Senate another possible law to pay for the government. It would have different ideas for the Senate to look at, he said.\n\n## Fight Over Obamacare Goes On And On\n\nRepublicans claim the law was costing jobs and driving up costs.\n\n\"The American people overwhelmingly reject Obamacare,\" said Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"They understand it's not working. The only people who aren't listening to the argument are the career politicians in Washington.\"\n\nObama has said he won't let the law be stripped. It is one of his biggest achievements. Democrats say Republicans are stuck on trying to attack the law.\n\nRepublicans have criticized rules put on insurers. But the House bill did contain new wins for Democrats.\n\nRepublicans said their measure would leave in place most parts of the law that have taken effect. Those include making insurance companies let people with medical problems buy insurance. They would also have to let children up to age 26 stay on the parents' insurance. Insurance lets people pay money ahead of time to make sure that they have health care.\n\nBut it would delay a rule that says people would have to pay a fine if they did not buy insurance. It would also delay the opening of marketplaces that would sell insurance. The marketplaces are supposed to start working this Tuesday.'"

            "text": "\tOTTAWA, Canada - Canada used to have a peaceful image, even though it has helped the United States in wars. Now Canadians fear that the violence of war has come to their homeland.\n\nThere have been two deadly attacks against members of the Canada's military in less than a week.\n\nCanada's leader is Prime Minister Stephen Harper. He spoke at a government building where an attacker was shot only one day before. Harper promised to speed up a plan to change laws. New laws would give Canada's government more power to gather information, hold suspects, and arrest people. These new laws could help prevent future attacks.\n\nThe point of these attacks was to strike \"fear and panic in our country,\" Harper said. \"Canadians will not be intimidated. We will not panic.\"\n\n## Two Separate Attacks\n\nMichael Zehaf-Bibeau was the gunman. He shot and killed a soldier, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, before 10 a.m. Cirillo was guarding a war memorial. Then, Zehaf-Bibeau got into a car he had bought the day before. He drove a short distance to Parliament Hill, where Canada's government meets.\n\nThere is video that shows Zehaf-Bibeau parking his car in front of a building entrance. He then runs toward government members' parked cars. He steals one of the cars and drives to the main government building where lawmakers were holding meetings.\n\nPolice chased the car and were seconds behind Zehaf-Bibeau when he ran through the main doors. Inside the building, security and police fired at Zehaf-Bibeau, who shot back. Eventually, they killed him.\n\nSecurity officials said Zehaf-Bibeau was the sole attacker and there was no connection between Wednesday's attacks and an earlier one. On Monday, there was another attack in Quebec. A man described as a Muslim extremist ran over two soldiers with his car. He killed one of them before being killed by the police.\n\nThe Canadian police looked at Zehaf-Bibeau's records. They found out that he had been staying in a homeless shelter. They also saw that he had a history of arrests for drugs, violence and other crimes.\n\n## \"We Are Sorry\"\n\nThe suspect's mother, Susan Bibeau, offered an apology on Thursday.\n\n\"Can you ever explain something like this?\" she said. \"We are sorry. If I'm crying, it's for the people,\" she said. \"Not for my son.\"\n\nCanadians discussed what the government would do in response to the attacks. Many feel there will be more restrictions on everyday life ahead.\n\nFences and yellow police tape circled government land and buildings. Officers carried guns to guard the area.\n\nShawn Perry is a 41-year-old from Newfoundland. He said he was concerned about the effect the attacks might have on Canadians' rights.\n\n\"I know that there needs to be more done here to increase security,\" he said. \"The thing about Canada is we enjoy an awful lot of freedom. I just don't want lawmakers to overreact\" and take any of it away.\n\n## At The War Memorial\n\nOn a chilly, cloudy day, the war memorial was crowded with people. They brought flowers, notes or just their thoughts.\n\nSikander Hashmi is a Muslim religious leader. He works with the Kanata Muslim Association. He said he had brought flowers to express his \"sadness and outrage.\"\n\n\"This is my home country,\" he said. \"I don't appreciate anyone trying to spread bloodshed. Especially someone\" calling themselves Muslim.\n\nJim Munson is a senator for the Liberal Party. He represents Ontario, where Ottowa is located. Munson said Canada's fighting in the Middle East has changed the way the world sees the country.\n\n\"The Canadian flag was once a symbol of openness and peace,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"Now it is on our head as a target.\"'"

It published articles and political cartoons that harshly criticized religious groups, including Muslims.\n\nPolitical cartoons often cause anger in the United States. Cartoonists in the U.S. can receive angry letters and emails. Sometimes they are even threatened, but rarely do they face violence. In other parts of the world, being a cartoonist is more dangerous.\n\nOpinion articles can explain a viewpoint and leave room for disagreement. A political cartoon is more direct, more blunt, said Kevin Siers. He is a cartoonist with the Charlotte Observer in North Carolina.\n\nYou can't argue with a cartoon: it just hits you, Siers said.\n\n## Using The Pen\n\nAnn Telnaes is a cartoonist with the Washington Post. When she first heard about the shootings on Twitter, she was horrified. She immediately began to draw a cartoon in response. She wanted to express her anger. She wanted to honor the dead.\n\nOther political cartoonists around the world have also used the pen to respond. In cartoons, they reach out to each other. They stand up for free speech. They mourn the cartoonists who were killed.\n\nTelnaes has received threats before because of her cartoons. One threat brought in the FBI to investigate. Cartoons have a special power to connect with people, she said. This also means they have a special power to make people very angry.\n\nCartoons are visual, she said. They can be easily understood by people all over the world.\n\n\"A really well-drawn cartoon should grab you quickly,\" Telnaes said.\n\n## Offending Religious Groups\n\nPolitical cartoonist Pat Bagley knows what it's like to offend a religious group. He lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, the center of the Mormon Church. Bagley, a former Mormon, drew cartoons making fun of Gordon B. Hinckley, an important Mormon prophet.\n\nMany people were offended by the cartoons, Bagley said.\n\nBagley said he got some scary emails. \"People let me know they own guns, they know how to use them, and I should be careful,\" he said.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, a Danish newspaper offended many Muslims. It published cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammad in a bad light. Muslims do not show Muhammad in drawings or movies.\n\nMany people protested against the cartoons in Muslim countries around the world. Hundreds were killed or injured in the protests.\n\n## \"A Cartoonist Has A Brick\"\n\n\"In Europe and the Middle East, they take cartoons deadly seriously,\" Bagley said. \"In the U.S., we're more entertainers.\"\n\nCartoonists are rarely attacked or killed in the U.S., Bagley said.\n\n\"It happens all the time in the Middle East, and it happens way too often in South America and sometimes in Europe. It's really depressing,\" he said.\n\nClay Bennett  is a cartoonist in Tennessee. He explained that writers have \"a thousand pebbles to throw every day. A cartoonist has a brick.\"\n\nJoel Pett is a cartoonist in Kentucky. He said the attack in France should be a reminder. It should tell cartoonists not to waste their opportunity \"to draw about something that matters.\"\n\nIt's so tempting to draw something about celebrities \"or something that has absolutely no importance,\" said Pett. \"People are dying out there for free speech.

He said the 80 soldiers will remain until their help is no longer needed. Many of the soldiers will operate aircraft searching for the girls.\n\nThe U.S. is increasing its effort to find the girls. More than 300 girls were kidnapped from their school April 14. More than 270 remain missing. The rest of them escaped. The girls were taken by Nigeria's most feared and powerful extremist group, Boko Haram. The group's leader is threatening to sell them into slavery.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the U.S. sent about two dozen experts to help with the hunt. They included intelligence and law enforcement officers. Fewer than 10 were from the military.\n\n## Taken By Boko Haram\n\nMilitary officials say the soldiers will operate an unarmed Predator [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone). A drone is an unmanned aircraft equipped with a camera. It will try to locate the girls from the air.\n\nU.S. officials believe Boko Haram divided the girls into smaller groups. The girls are believed to be hidden in the deep forests of northeastern Nigeria. The area is about the size of West Virginia. Navy Admiral John Kirby is the spokesman for the Department of Defense. It is in charge of the U.S. military. He said the hunt for the girls is like searching for \"a needle in the jungle.\"\n\n\"We've not seen anything that indicates their location at this point,\" Kirby said. The U.S. is sharing information with the Nigerian government. But so far, it hasn't discovered much.\n\nFor the last five years, Boko Haram has terrorized Nigeria. It has been especially active in the north. The group has kidnapped and killed many people. On Wednesday, Boko Haram members attacked three villages. At least 40 people were killed near the school where the girls were taken last month.\n\nU.S. officials are in a difficult position. They can't give help to anyone involved in human rights abuses. That would include much of the Nigerian army. Some members of Boko Haram also belong to the army.\n\nAlice Friend is in charge of African issues for the Defense Department. She said officials are being \"very, very careful.\" They are giving information only to Nigerians who won't use it to hurt people.\n\n## Threats Against Girls\n\nSince 2010, Boko Haram is believed to have killed at least 300 students. Boko Haram can be translated as \"Western education is forbidden.\" The group is against girls going to school. It said it kidnapped the girls because they should be married rather than go to school. It has threatened to sell them into slavery.\n\nThe girls' kidnapping sparked anger around the world. People began a Twitter hashtag campaign, #bringbackourgirls. First lady Michelle Obama participated in the Twitter campaign. In the last week, it has lost some of its popularity.\n\nThe troops will be stationed in the neighboring country of Chad. They will not be in Nigeria. But, some Nigerians will be mad about it anyway. Some people in Nigeria question why the U.S. military is getting involved in Africa.\n\nU.S. officials have said the Nigerians must be the ones to rescue the girls. They say the U.S. will just try to spot the girls.\n\n\"We're not talking about U.S. military operations in Nigeria to go find these girls,\" Kirby said. \"That's not the focus here.\"\n\nThe last time the United States sent troops to Africa was in 2011. Obama sent a small group of soldiers to central Africa to help find Joseph Kony. He was the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. The terror group used to operate in Uganda.\n\nThe U.S. troops hunting for Kony are still looking for him. Kony remains on the run.'"

The Reverend Clementa Pinckney was among the dead. Pinckney was the church's leader.\n\nThe church has played a big part in Charleston's history. It is very important to the city's black citizens.\n\n\"It's not just a church. It's also a symbol ... of black freedom,\" historian Robert Greene said. \"That's why so many folks are so upset.\" The church \"represents so much about the rich history and tradition of African Americans in Charleston.\"\n\n## Specially Nicknamed \"Mother Emanuel\"\n\nIn Charleston, the church is known as \"Mother Emanuel.\" It is a place in which people take pride, said the Reverend Stephen Singleton. He served as the church's pastor from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe church is \"a very special place,\" Reverend Pinckney said two years ago. It has been part of \"the history and life of African-Americans since about the early 1800s.\"\n\nThe church was founded by Pastor Morris Brown in 1816. At the time, most of Charleston's black population were slaves under the control of white people. Brown was tired of the racism he experienced in Charleston's churches. About 4,000 of the city's African-Americans quickly joined his new church.\n\nFrom the beginning, the church was a center for the fight against slavery. The city's whites soon became distrustful of the church. Worshippers were sometimes arrested.\n\nWhites had some reason for the lack of trust. Denmark Vesey was a leader in the church. Vesey often declared that the enslavement of African-Americans would be punished with death. In 1822, he and other leaders began plotting a slave revolt to throw off the rule of the white owners.\n\n## New Dreams, New Church\n\nThe revolt was planned for June 16. However, a slave named George Wilson told his master about the plan. Vesey and about 36 others were arrested and put to death. Another 60 were forced to leave the city.\n\nFollowing the uprising, South Carolina introduced new laws aimed against African-American churches. Black churchgoers were no longer allowed to hold services without a white person present. The Charleston A.M.E. members were separated. Their church building was set on fire.\n\nThe A.M.E. membership soon began holding services in secret. Then came the Civil War (1860-1865) between the North and the slave-owning South. After the war, the South's slaves were freed. The A.M.E. membership was able to hold services openly again. Soon, a new church was built on Calhoun Street.\n\nIn 1886 the new building was destroyed in an earthquake. The church's membership then replaced it with the beautiful building seen today.\n\n## The Church Has Witnessed Much History\n\nBy the 1900s, Emanuel A.M.E. was once again a center of black struggle. During the 1950s, the civil rights movement spread across the country. The movement aimed to win equal rights for African-Americans.\n\nMany famous black leaders have appeared at the church over the years. Booker T. Washington spoke there in 1909. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech there in 1962. In 1969, Coretta Scott King led a march from Emanuel A.M.E.'s steps.\n\nCivil rights protesting in Charleston \"was almost always centered around that church,\" Greene said.\n\nMany were very shocked by the recent deadly shooting.\n\nPolice said the suspected gunman, Dylann Roof, who is 21, was caught less than 24 hours after the killings.\n\n\"If we're not safe in the church, God, you tell us where we are safe,\" mourners said.\n\nStill, the church will live on.\n\nEmanuel A.M.E. \"won't be destroyed because of this,\" Reverend Singleton said. \"Chances are it'll probably come out stronger.\"'"

At least 51,705 children and teenagers from Central America entered the United States illegally in 2014. It was more than twice as many as the year before.\n\nPlaces to live were eventually found for most of the children. More than 3,100 are now living in South Florida.\n\n## Some Are Doing Well, Some Have Big Problems\n\nFewer children are crossing the border now. Some of the children who crossed the border last year are doing well. Others are dealing with big problems.\n\nMany people who cross into the U.S. without permission cannot stay. They will have to go back to the country they came from.\n\nNora Sandigo said she thinks half the children have been allowed to stay. Sandigo leads a group that supports immigrants. The group helps people who came from other countries to live in the U.S.\n\nSandigo said one problem is there are not enough lawyers. Lawyers would help more children fight to stay in the U.S. There is also not enough money going to public schools. The schools have to teach and provide lunch and help for the children.\n\n## Many Parents Lack Papers\n\nFrancisco Portillo is president of another group. It is called Francisco Morazan Honduran Organization. He agreed with Sandigo. He also said U.S. officials also have gotten tougher on many of the children's parents. Those parents do not have papers showing they have permission to be in the country, he said.\n\nJose Cruz is a Cuban-American who used to be a priest. He helped young Cubans who came the U.S. in the 1960s. He said the Central American children have a big problem. Cruz and two other Cuban-Americans have formed the Peter Pan Border Operation. The group helps Central American children find homes and support in the U.S.\n\nCruz said nine of every 10 of the boys and girls do not have someone watching over them. They also do not have help with money.\n\nCruz said he is also concerned that some of the children may be living in homes that have too many people. Others may be forced to work to support their families. Some also have trouble in school. They don't know English and don't eat well, he said.\n\n## Big Health Concerns\n\nDr. Jorge Herrera is president of the group. He said he also is worried about the children's overall health. They do not have insurance, which would pay the costs if the get sick. They also do not get regular health care, he said.\n\nCruz and Herrera have asked the White House to let them take charge of Central American children in the U.S. They have also asked for money to help them do this.\n\nThe White House has not responded yet, Cruz said.\n\n## Schools Have Welcomed The Children\n\nJohn Schuster works for the Miami-Dade County public schools. Schuster said the Central American children have been welcomed at school. They are adjusting as well as can be expected, he said.\n\nOverall, Schuster said, the children may be facing problems.

Now he stands among the ruins of his place of worship.\n\nGaballah is upset by the destroyed building. The benches where people prayed are gone. Paintings of Jesus are burned. The cross was ripped off from the front door. Gaballah just keeps saying, \"This scene is horrible.\"\n\nThe Egyptian government promised to repair this church. But work has not yet begun. It is one of 74 churches destroyed in Egypt. The attacks happened after Egypt's president was thrown out of power. The army forced President Mohammed Morsi out on July 3.\n\nThis church stands as a symbol. It shows that the new government has not protected Egypt's historic places.\n\n## Attacks Continue On Churches\n\nBut Gaballah does not want to complain about the government. Nor do other Christians. \"Of course they are doing enough,\" he said. But the destroyed church around him told a different story.\n\nThe attacks on churches sparked anger at first. This was just after President Morsi was removed from power. Now, both Christian and Muslim Egyptians are completely silent. Yet the attacks continue across the country.\n\nAt least 74 attacks on churches happened between June 30 and Sept. 30.  There have been more since, but nobody knows exactly how many.\n\nOne out of 10 Egyptians is a Christian. They have never had an easy time in the country. The Christians have been often stuck between the government and a big Muslim population.\n\nEgyptian governments have done little to protect Christians from attacks by Muslims. No one has ever been punished in Egyptian courts for destroying Christian churches. The first church was burned in 1972.\n\nYet Christians don't want to complain. The new government has not spoken out against Christians.  The Christians don't want to get on the bad side of the latest rulers.\n\n## \"Freedom Or The Right To Live\"\n\nMany of the attacks on Christian churches were caused by certain Muslim preachers who don't like Christians. They think Christians stand in the way of Egypt being a Muslim country. They claimed that the Christians made Morsi leave power. Morsi was part of the Muslim Brotherhood, a secret group that is again banned in Egypt.\n\nIshak Ibrahim is an Egyptian Christian. He thinks that Christians want to live under a government run by the army instead of a democracy run by Muslims. \"The choice before people is freedom or the right to live,\" Ibrahim said.\n\nYoussef Sidhom is the editor-in-chief of Watani, Egypt's biggest Christian newspaper. He said that Christians and many Muslims were united against Morsi. They also stood together against the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nBut Sidhom thinks that the Christians are now \"terrified to speak.\"\n\nThere is not much pressure on the government to do more for Christians. The police say they don't have enough people to protect 2,000 Christian churches in Egypt. It is harder for the police because their stations have also been attacked.\n\n## Police Blame Muslim Brotherhood\n\nOne policeman said that they are not trying to find out who destroyed the churches. He said that some villagers were too scared to talk about who started the fires.\n\nThe officer said that keeping churches safe is not the police's job. The police first want to find out who destroyed their stations. They also want to capture members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nOther people think the police have different reasons. Every attack on churches gives them more reasons to chase people who liked President Morsi. The police will also get more support from the public. Many Egyptians were shocked by the attacks on churches.\n\nAhmed Ragab has studied the attacks. He said that when churches are burned, the government can blame the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nPope Tawadros II is the leader of Egypt's Christian church. He made a statement after Archangel Michael church was attacked. Tawadros called for national unity and forgiveness.\n\nHe also asked for Christians to support the government. \"If the hands of evil kill, destroy and torch, then God's hands are greater and they build,\" he said.

The governor said Monday that he signed the bill even though he was not very willing.\n\nSome people believe treatment can change to whom a gay person is attracted. Others say its not possible and that it does harm. The topic has been the subject of many arguments lately.\n\nChristie said he had concerns about the law. He did not like limiting parents' choices of care and treatment for their children. Christie said he decided to sign the bill after looking at what doctors said about the treatment.\n\nHe pointed out the American Psychological Association's opinion. The group says the treatment can lead to a lot of problems. Children can become very sad for a long time. They can abuse drugs and they can think about harming themselves.\n\n## May Run For President In 2016\n\nChristie is a Republican. The decision comes at an important time. He runs for re-election in New Jersey this year. He also may be getting ready to run for president in 2016. His past comments make him different from some important members of his Party. They consider homosexuality a sin. They think that people choose to be homosexual and are not born gay. Christie does not.\n\nChristie was asked about signing the bill at an event on Monday. He did not answer the questions. He referred reporters to a written statement.\n\nChristie's office also gave out a 2011 video. It showed the governor being interviewed about homosexuality on CNN. He was asked if homosexuality is a sin. The governor is Catholic. He responded that his religion says it is.\n\nBut Christie also said he believed that people were born with the likelihood to be gay. \"And so I think if someone is born that way, it's very difficult to say then that's a sin.\"\n\n## Concerned About Parents' Rights\n\nThe bill won wide support from New Jersey lawmakers. But some people said the law interferes with parents' rights.\n\nChristie said he was concerned about that.\n\nThe law says licensed counselors cannot try to change a gay child to straight. Counselors include psychologists, social workers and therapists.\n\nLawmakers held hearings before voting on the law. Witnesses at the hearings described very bad childhood experiences in which people tried the therapy on them.\n\nThe law passed the Assembly by a 56-14 in June. Seven lawmakers chose not to vote. The Senate approved it by a vote of 28-9 that same month.\n\n## Praised By Gay Supporters\n\nA group that supports gay rights issued a statement Monday praising Christie's decision to sign the bill.\n\nThe group said it hoped that Christie would realize that the best way to protect gay youth was to make sure they were treated equally.\n\nChristie has mostly been criticized by supporters of gay people. He stopped a bill last year that would have allowed gay marriage in New Jersey. He insists that voters should be the ones to decide instead. Others argue that gay marriage is a civil right. They say such rights should not be decided at the voting booth.'"

            "text": "\tChris Christie is governor of New Jersey. In February, he appeared on a late-night comedy show. He bit into a jelly doughnut. He made fun of his own weight. Ten days later, he had a secret weight-loss operation.\n\nAnd then it was back to work. He appeared as if nothing had happened. He made no mention of the operation at any of the meetings he held that week.\n\n\"If I had the choice, I wouldn't have ever talked about it,\" Christie said on Tuesday. He said that a news report about his surgery was indeed true. Christie has joked about his weight throughout his career. However, the governor said it was his plan all along never to admit publicly that he had the surgery.\n\n\"It's nobody else's business,\" Christie said. He added that it became public only because a reporter asked him a direct question about the operation. \"I would never have lied about it.\"\n\nIt is, Christie said, a deeply private matter. Christie has struggled for decades with his weight. And he said it has absolutely nothing to do with politics. Christie's term in office is nearly over. He plans to run for re-election. Political watchers say he has a chance to be the Republican candidate in the 2016 race for president.\n\n## Family Matters\n\nChristie told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that he decided to have the surgery for his family. He has a wife and four children. He turned 50 in September.\n\n\"My long-term goal is to get myself into a position where I'm healthier and I can live a longer life and be an active parent and hopefully someday grandparent,\" Christie said. His youngest two children are in elementary school.\n\n\"I want to try to put myself, as I get older, in the best position I can be to spend as much time with them as I possibly can,\" he said.\n\nChristie declined to say how much weight he has lost. Nor would he say how much he weighs now or how much he plans to lose. He said such questions are nobody's business. He called the media attention \"ridiculous\" and \"silly.\"\n\nChristie discussed the operation with no one outside his family, except for his chief of staff and chief counsel. New York Jets coach Rex Ryan had the same surgery. He shared his experiences with the governor in a phone call. But Christie said he never told the coach that he was thinking about doing it himself.\n\n## No Role Model\n\nChristie said he has no plans to become an example for weight loss.\n\n\"I do not see myself nor do I care to be a role model in this regard for anyone,\" he said. \"This is an intensely personal issue for me.\"\n\nLess than two weeks before his surgery, Christie appeared on \"The Late Show.\" Comedian David Letterman asked Christie if his jokes about the governor's weight bothered him. The governor then pulled the donut out of his pocket. He took a bite. He licked his fingers. The audience laughed. Christie said his size was \"fair game.\" He added, \"I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've ever seen in your life.\"\n\nThe next day, former White House doctor Connie Mariano told CNN that she worries about his \"dying in office.\" Her comment angered the governor. Christie said his children heard it. He called Mariano a \"hack who wants five minutes on TV.\"\n\nThe governor has been open about his struggle with his weight. During a news conference after the Letterman show, he said \"there's always a plan\" to shed pounds. He said he's been working with a personal trainer four days a week since running for office. His workouts include weight lifting.\n\n## Do Voters Weigh Candidates?\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine ran against Christie in 2009. Corzine tried to make Christie's weight an issue. Christie said, \"I don't know what that has to do with being governor.\" Christie beat Corzine.\n\nChristie denied that politics was the reason for the operation. He also said that he doesn't think his weight should matter if he decides to run for a higher position.'"

            "text": "\tThe young scientists in this basement laboratory are all gathered around a smartphone. They aren't on break, this is their work.\n\nTheir computer science professor is holding the phone. He is walking through the University of Minnesota's Walter Library.\n\nAs he walks, a 3-D map of the library appears on the phone's screen.\n\nThe professor and his students are working with Google to develop smartphones that can easily make 3-D maps. Google gave the university $1.35 million to work on this technology.\n\n## Advanced Map Technology\n\nNowadays, many people use Google Maps for directions. Indoor 3-D maps would have many possibilities.\n\nThese maps could help you find your classroom in a huge school or find a coffee shop in an airport.\n\nThere are also other uses. People trying to sell their house could make digital tours. The technology could help blind people walk through a building.\n\nThe technology is new and very advanced. Still, the scientists hope it can work on smartphones people already own.\n\nProfessor Stergios Roumeliotis has been working on map technology since 1995. He says this new technology could be as important as Google Maps.\n\n\"This new software could become the Google Maps of the indoor world,\" Roumeliotis said. \"This is where we spend most of our time.\"\n\nThe University of Minnesota's software is important for two reasons. First, it creates a map almost instantly. Second, it does this without slowing down the phone or using too much battery power.\n\nTo do that, the University of Minnesota team had to try some creative design ideas.\n\n## Cellphone's Camera And Sensor\n\nMost map software uses global positioning satellite (GPS) signals. This new software doesn't. Instead it uses the phone's camera and built-in motion sensor.\n\nScientists at the University of Minnesota worked with NASA in the past to help navigate Mars landing vehicles. Now, they are using that knowledge for the 3-D mapping project.\n\nIt's not unusual for Google to reach out to universities for help in creating new technology, explained Scott Strawn. Strawn's job is to closely follow what tech companies like Google are doing.\n\nThere is a lot of brainpower at universities, Strawn said. That's what Google needs to move these projects forward.\n\nMapping the Mall of America today would take many computers and a lot of time, Roumeliotis said.\n\n\"Our plan is to do that on a cellphone in almost real time,\" he added. \"We're on the frontier of this kind of mapping.\"'"

            "text": "\tLONDON - When people turn on their smartphone to play \"Angry Birds,\" spies may be watching. Top secret papers suggest that spy groups can collect information from smartphones across the globe.\n\nThe secret papers were leaked by Edward Snowden. He used to do work for the National Security Agency (NSA). He took the papers from the U.S. spy agency and gave them to a newspaper. They show that the NSA tracks Americans' phone calls and emails.\n\nThe newest papers were published Monday by The New York Times. The British newspaper the Guardian and ProPublica also published the secret papers.\n\nApps are common on the world's roughly 1 billion smartphones. People download map apps, games, and social networking apps, like Facebook. The leaked papers show that America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ spy agency have worked together. They're both trying to gain information from the apps.\n\n## Watching Google Maps\n\nSome apps are considered \"leaky.\" Those apps may be feeding huge amounts of information to the spy agencies. A person's location can be found. What groups a person joins can be found out too.\n\nThe size of the spying program isn't known. Yet, the reports suggest that the spy agencies can easily collect information from apps. Two of the biggest apps mentioned in reports are \"Angry Birds\" and Google Maps.\n\nThe NSA says that it watches phones for good reason. Often, they are used in planning terrorist attacks like bombings.\n\nThe NSA says it is not interested in \"everyday Americans.\" The agency says it only collects information \"that we are authorized by law to collect.\"\n\nGCHQ said its activity was legal and \"necessary.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that spy groups are interested in tracking cellphones. Snowden's other leaks have shown that. However, the interest in apps is new.\n\n## Tracking The Apps\n\n\"Angry Birds\" was one of the most eye-catching examples. The game has been downloaded more than 1.7 billion times worldwide. In the addictive game, birds attack pigs. The Times and ProPublica said a 2012 British intelligence report explained how to gather information on \"Angry Birds\" players.\n\nAnother document published to the Web was a 14-page-long NSA slideshow. It listed several other apps. Facebook, photo sharing site Flickr, and the film app Flixster were watched.\n\nIt wasn't clear what information can be collected. And from which apps. A cellphone's settings, where it connected to, and which websites it had visited could be tracked. Also, which documents it had downloaded. The names of a cellphone users' friends can be found.\n\nGoogle did not comment on the reports. Neither did the maker of \"Angry Birds.\"\n\nThe Times briefly posted a secret U.S. document to the Web Monday. Computer experts said it revealed some information. The experts were able to discover the name of an NSA worker in the documents. They also picked out the name of a Middle Eastern terror group the NSA was targeting. Details about the types of computer files the NSA considered useful were also found.\n\nSnowden began leaking secret NSA papers in June. His supporters say they have been careful not to give away the names of any spies. They claim they have not put ongoing spying at risk.\n\nA Times spokeswoman said the information had been posted by accident. The material has since been removed.'"

            "text": "\tThe movie \"Big Hero 6\" has been a big success for Walt Disney Animation Studios in many ways. It made a lot of money. Movie critics and audiences loved it.\n\nOne important thing about \"Big Hero 6\" is the way it was made. Disney Animation created new software to animate this movie. It took 39,000 hours to make this complicated computer program.\n\n## Lights, Camera, Hyperion!\n\nThe software is called Hyperion. It makes it easier to work with light in a movie. With Hyperion, light acts and looks more realistic. This makes movies look better: more lifelike or dreamlike.\n\nCompanies that create animated movies have been battling to develop the best technology. One of Disney's rivals is DreamWorks Animation. DreamWorks has a team of about 120 who work on new technology. Some of these people used to work for NASA. That's the government agency that sends rockets and satellites into space.\n\nDisney's Hyperion could change how animated movies are made.\n\n\"It's a major step for them,\" said Dan Sarto. He is a journalist who follows the animation business.\n\n## Powerful New Tool\n\nComputer-animated films can make a lot of money. In most years, some of the top 10 money-making movies are animated. Companies also make toys and clothes based on the movies. People buy a lot of those products.\n\nDisney Animation made the movie \"Frozen,\" which has made more than $1 billion worldwide.\n\nHuge hits like \"Frozen\" are rare. But Hyperion is a powerful new tool for Disney Animation.\n\nThe software was created to solve a problem. Disney Animation bosses needed a stronger computer program to make \"Big Hero 6\" look the way they wanted.\n\nThe movie was released in November. It is about a robot called Baymax and a young robot design expert named Hiro. The two form a superhero group. They fight a masked bad guy. The story takes place in the city of San Fransokyo. The make-believe city is a mix of San Francisco and Tokyo. It is near the water and it's filled with tall buildings and bright, flashing lights.\n\n## Flying Through The Light\n\nPeople complimented the film's animation. Several flying scenes in the movie are filled with amazingly realistic light. Without Hyperion, the movie would not have looked as beautiful, said Disney Animation's Andy Hendrickson.\n\nThe software is now being used by Disney Animation for its movie \"Zootopia.\" It also was used for \"Frozen Fever,\" a short film with characters from \"Frozen.\"\n\nBefore Hyperion, it was difficult to get the light right in an animated movie. Each ray of light moved had to be tracked separately. One movie scene could contain several light sources - the sun and a lamp, for example. Each ray of light can bounce off many surfaces. It was tough work for a computer to do the math.\n\nLight can split into \"thousands of rays,\" Hendrickson said. \"Does it reflect right back if it came off a mirror? Does it scatter? Does it pick up the color of the object? You end up running out of computing power.\"\n\n## Taking A Big Risk\n\nIt took about 2 1/2 years to develop Hyperion. A software engineer named Brent Burley came up with the idea.\n\nHe suggested organizing large groups of light rays into bundles. Doing this would make it easier for a computer to do the math. Now, movies could have more light sources. The light could look more detailed.\n\nThe decision to create Hyperion was risky. Programmers were still working on it when \"Big Hero 6\" was being created. They raced to complete Hyperion. They finished only a few months before it was needed. If the software did not work as Disney Animation hoped, \"Big Hero 6\" could have been in trouble.\n\n\"This was a big risk,\" Sarto said. \"But it will pay off for them.\"'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - Apple Stores are not just a place to buy the latest phone or computer anymore. Now they are also a place to see art.\n\nThe art in Apple Stores is not the old-fashioned kind of art, though. It is all made on cellphones, tablets or computers.\n\nApple invited 12 artists to make new artworks. The artists were asked to do their art on iPads, iPhones or Mac computers.\n\nThe photos and other artworks the artists made can now be seen in Apple Stores. They can also be seen online.\n\n## Photos Of A Glacier\n\nAustin Mann is one of the 12 artists Apple invited. He used an iPhone 6 to take photos of a glacier in Iceland.\n\nMann takes many of his pictures with his iPhone. He likes the way taking pictures with an iPhone is so cheap and easy.\n\nTechnology is not just saving artists money. It also changes how they work.\n\nRoz Hall is another of Apple's 12 featured artists. New technology has certainly meant big changes for him.\n\nHall once did his paintings the old way, with real paint brushes. Then, he began using an app called Brushes. The app let him paint on his iPhone.\n\n## No More Mixing Paint\n\nHall's earlier paintings were life-size. The new ones were done on a 3.5-inch screen.\n\nHall said he likes painting on an iPhone or iPad. He enjoys not having to prepare before he starts working. He no longer needs to mix paints. He can get right to work as soon as he has an idea.\n\nHall has not painted the old way for many years, he says. Instead, he uses the app Procreate. The app lets him paint with his fingers on his iPad.\n\nSome artists say that painting on a phone or computer is cheating. They say it is too easy to erase mistakes.\n\nHall does not agree. He thinks being able to erase mistakes easily is a good thing. He says it makes artists more daring. Artists no longer have to worry about expensive mistakes.\n\nSuppose a painting starts to go wrong, he says. An artist who spent $75 on paint might not want to stop working. \"You don't want to waste what you spent.\" Artists are more willing to start over if it does not cost them anything.\n\n## The Eye Of The iPhone\n\nHall painted pictures of people for the Apple project. One picture shows a young, bearded man with bright yellow glasses. Another shows a thoughtful-looking woman in a floppy black hat. All the paintings were done with the Procreate app.\n\nAlistair Taylor-Young is another of Apple's featured artists. He used his iPhone 6 to take take photos of rainy city streets.\n\nTaylor-Young liked that it was very simple to take pictures. \"You just saw something and took a photo.\"\n\nIn the past, most people only took photos to record special events, like birthdays. Now, people carry their phones everywhere. They are always there when you want them. Today, many of us use our cameras constantly.\n\nPhotography is now something everyone can do.'"

            "text": "\tCUPERTINO, Calif. - Apple just bought Beats Electronics. It paid $3 billion for the company. The deal will bring it more music listeners and and some extra swagger.\n\nBeats Electronics is a headphone maker and music streaming company. It was founded by rapper Dr. Dre and businessman Jimmy Iovine.\n\nIt's the most expensive purchase Apple has ever made. Apple is paying that price to defend its iTunes store. The iTunes store is in danger of losing customers to other music services.\n\nBeats is already making money. It took in $1.1 billion last year. It will increase Apple's earnings starting in October.\n\n## The Companies Have Big Goals\n\nIovine and Dre were important in the deal. They began working with Apple in the early days of its iTunes store. Now they will work in Apple's music divisions.\n\nTim Cook runs Apple. \"We have known these guys forever,\" Cook said of Iovine and Dre. \"We've dated, we've gone steady and now we are getting married. These two guys have a very rare set of skills. It's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach. It's that rare.\"\n\nCook said Beats' music-streaming service was the main selling point. He thinks the headphone line will to continue growing, too.\n\nIovine thinks most technology companies are dumb. At least when it comes to culture. But he thinks Apple will help Beats to achieve its goals. Beats wants to improve the sound of digital music. It also wants to create playlists specifically for each subscriber.\n\n\"To complete our dream, we needed a company like (Apple),\" Iovine said. \"We couldn't finish this on our own.\"\n\n## Streaming Music Is The Future\n\nThere are other music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. They have been growing in popularity. But this has meant lower sales of songs and albums.\n\niTunes was on top of that business for the past 10 years. U.S. sales of downloaded songs fell last year. They only sold $2.8 billion. Meanwhile, streaming music made $1.4 billion.\n\nApple broke into streaming last September. It launched iTunes Radio. Unfortunately, the service has not been as popular as the company hoped.\n\nITunes Radio has 40 million listeners. It will continue as a free service with ads. Meanwhile, Beats Music will try to tap into the more than 800 million iTunes accounts. It will try to sell more subscriptions to its customized service.\n\nBeats Music has more than 250,000 subscribers. That's well below Spotify. It has more than 10 million paying customers.\n\nApple is counting on Beats to boost its image. It's trying to remain a leader in digital music.\n\n## All-Around Cool\n\n\"Apple suddenly has regained its cool,\" said Doug Morris. He runs Sony Music. He was one of the first people in the music business to support iTunes. In fact, it was because Iovine told him to. That was more than 10 years ago.\n\nBeats was started in 2008 by Dr. Dre and Iovine. Dre's real name is Andre Young. Iovine has worked in the music business for a long time. Now Beats is the leading high-priced headphone brand. Its equipment is also a big seller in Apple's stores.\n\nIovine has visited Apple regularly. He said he has no worries about joining the company. \"We can roller-skate in the halls here. Dre and I have been working together for 22 years. We are not about to go somewhere where we are going to fall.\"\n\nA video posted online a few weeks ago showed Dre celebrating the deal before it was announced. It called him hip-hop's first billionaire. He appeared calmer on Wednesday when the deal was official. \"To be able to do something that could potentially change the world, I'm thrilled,\" he said.'"

The other costs a lot less and comes in plastic.\n\nApple once changed the smartphone business. Now it hopes the new iPhones will help it close the gap on Samsung. The Korean company sells a lot more phones now. Apple is No. 2.\n\nApple revealed the new iPhones at its headquarters in California. The phones will go on sale on Sept. 20.\n\nWhy sell a cheaper phone? Not everybody can spend so much on new electronics. There are more Chinese customers than anywhere else. But people there do not have as much money. The 5C costs less. It may help Apple sell more phones to the Chinese. And in other places.\n\n## 5C Comes In Five Colors\n\nGartner Inc. is a company that studies electronics sales. It said that Apple sold 14.4 percent of the world's smartphones from April through June. Samsung sold 31.7 percent.\n\nThe iPhone 5C will be sold in five colors. Customers can decide between green, blue, yellow, pink and white. The 5C has a 4-inch screen. The rear cover lights up.\n\nThe 5C will cost $99 or $199. It depends how much memory you want the phone to have. Those prices are only good if you have a two-year contract with a cellphone carrier.\n\nPeter Misek called the phones \"lovely.\" Misek keeps close watch on the smartphone business as part of his job at Jefferies. But even the lowest $99 price for the 5C \"is higher than expected\" he said. Other companies still sell a smartphone for less.\n\nThe second phone is the 5S. It is \"the most forward-looking phone we have ever created,\" said Phil Schiller. He works at Apple. It will come in silver, gold and \"space gray.\" It has electronics inside than can work twice as fast as the A6.\n\nSchiller said the new phone can run more health and fitness programs. These apps have become increasingly popular. More people are using them to track exercise, how much they eat and even how they sleep.\n\n## iSight Camera And Fingerprinting\n\nThe camera in the 5S was improved. It should take better pictures, Apple said. It can capture more light. The phone also has a \"true-tone\" flash feature. The flash is designed not to clash with the colors in the room or a person's skin color. Schiller said this has not been done on a phone before.\n\nThe camera is called iSight. It is designed to help avoid blurry pictures. It also has a slow-motion camera for video. A \"burst mode\" can take 10 frames per second as long as you hold your finger on the button. Then it finds the best one to keep.\n\nThe 5S also includes \"Touch ID.\" This is what reads your fingerprints. The 5S learns about your fingerprint. Then you can just touch the home button to unlock the phone. The company said fingerprints will not be stored on Apple's computer servers.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner could be used as a new way for people pay for things. Such a technology could open new ways for Apple to make money.\n\nBoth models will be on sale on Sept. 20 in the United States and other countries, including China.\n\n## Free Download For New System\n\nApple said this is the first time that a new phone will be available right away in China. This is a sign of the growing importance of Chinese customers to the company.\n\nThe 5S will cost $199, $299 or $399. The price depends on how much memory the phones has. You have to have a two-year contract with a cellphone company to get the price.\n\nApple also said its next mobile operating system, iOS 7, will be available as a free download on Sept. 18. The operating system manages how the phone works and how apps work on it.\n\nThe new system can be downloaded on the iPhone 4 and later models, as well as on the tablets beginning with the iPad 2.\n\nApple also said that it expects to ship its 700 millionth iOS device next month.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook predicts that iOS 7 will become the most popular mobile operating system in the world. Investors seemed unimpressed. Apple's stock price fell $11.60, or 2.3 percent. One share of Apple was worth $494.58 as the stock market closed on Tuesday.'"

This is costing the tech giant a lot of money. Apple is pushing record companies to release their new music through iTunes. Only later could other streaming services, like Spotify, stream it.\n\nMusic business insiders gave the information. They did not want their names used.\n\nThe music market is changing. And Apple is struggling to battle with the streaming services. It wants people to download music from iTunes, not stream it over the Internet. Apple is based in Cupertino, Calif.\n\n## iTunes Downloads Drop\n\n\"These are really changing times. And I think everybody's going to be trying different things, whether it's iTunes, Spotify\" or the music companies, said Irving Azoff. He manages the Eagles and Christina Aguilera. He also manages other music acts. \"It's kind of up for grabs.\"\n\nMost people in the U.S. who pay to download music to their phones and computers do it through Apple's iTunes store. They can listen to the music anytime they want. The iTunes store grew for about 10 years. But in 2013, its sales began to drop. Apple started making less money.\n\nThere are several reasons behind the drop in sales. But, the popularity of streaming services is the main one.\n\nSmartphones are how people listen to music on the go today. Almost half of smartphone owners use their phone every day to stream music. Fewer people use their phones for downloading music.\n\nApple makes more smartphones than any one company. And iTunes is the world's biggest music seller. But Apple only makes the iPhone. More people in the U.S. own Android phones. They're made by several companies. Android phones don't come with the iTunes app.\n\nAn Apple spokesman would not comment for this report.\n\n## Beyonce's Fast-Selling iTunes Release\n\n\"I've never had anyone (at Apple) say 'streaming is killing our business,'\" said Jim Guerinot. He is a music manager. His company handles No Doubt, Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) and other acts. Guerinot said Apple wants to offer customers something that no other company has.\n\nApple has pointed to the sales of Beyonce's fifth album in December. The album was offered only through iTunes. It became iTunes' fastest-selling album.\n\nFew artists are as popular as Beyonce. But Apple says her album is a good example. It shows how releasing music first on iTunes increases sales.\n\nBut Beyonce's album also angered Target and Amazon.com. Both refused to sell the CD when it was released.\n\nMore recently, hip-hop artist Kid Cudi's release, \"Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon,\" was sold only through iTunes and other download websites. It launched last week at No. 4 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts. The album sold 87,000 units.\n\n## Taking A Bite Out Of Apple Sales\n\nBut, rapper Schoolboy Q used streaming to let people know about his new album. \"Oxymoron\" was heavily promoted on Spotify. U.S. Spotify streamed songs from the album 3.3 million times before it came out.\n\nThe album began at the top of Billboard's album chart last week.\n\nIt sold nearly 139,000 copies in the first week the album was released. Two of the rapper's earlier albums sold just 17,000 and 48,000 copies.  They are \"Setbacks\" and \"Habits &amp; Contradictions.\"\n\nKen Parks helps run Spotify. He said Apple shouldn't tell people how to listen to music. People don't like it, he said.\n\nMark Mulligan is a music business expert. He said streaming services may be taking away Apple's best iTunes customers.\n\n\"It's not that streaming is replacing downloads,\" Mulligan said. Streaming companies are going after Apple's download customers who spend the most.'"

She is the mother of two children from Ohio. Apple told her the charges were not a mistake. They came from \"Dragonvale\" and they were all made in a single day.\n\n\"I almost choked,\" she said. \"It was shocking.\"\n\n## Buying Apps Without Permission\n\nThousands of people got the same kind of shock. They complained to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC protects people against businesses cheating them. On Wednesday, the FTC said that Apple will give back at least $32.5 million to parents, like Nussbaum. Their children all had spent money in the Apple store without their permission.\n\nEdith Ramirez is the head of the FTC. She said it is against the law to charge people for purchases they do not know about.\n\nThe FTC said parents did not know of these purchases very often. And Apple did not do enough to make it clear that their children were buying gems, coins or treats. Parents also did not know that entering their password started a 15-minute clock. During this time, kids could buy things without having to enter the password again.\n\nApple also agreed to change the way it bills customers. It will let people know when someone buys something on a game or app.\n\nTim Cook is the head of Apple. He said the company gave in to the FTC. The agreement does not ask Apple \"to do anything we weren't already going to do.\" So, the company decided to accept it instead of starting a long fight with the FTC.\n\nApple's store is a \"safe place\" for all its customers, he said.\n\nWhen Nussbaum found the charges, she called Apple right away. The company gave her back the $600 that her son, Andrew, spent. Nussbaum said Andrew had no idea he was buying gems with \"real money.\" He was only 10 at the time. He felt so bad he was going to sell his old toys to pay her back. Now he does not have to sell his toys.\n\nNussbaum also said Apple helped her set up passwords. She has not had a problem since.\n\n## Big Bills For \"Tiny Zoo Friends\"\n\nOther parents have not been so lucky. One parent said her daughter had spent $2,600 in \"Tap Pet Hotel.\" It is a game in which children build their own pet hotels. The game is free. But kids must pay for bowls of treats and sacks of coins.\n\nOthers parents reported their children spent more than $500. They played \"Dragon Story\" and \"Tiny Zoo Friends.\"\n\nLast year, a group of angry parents sued Apple. Apple agreed to give money back to 28 million of them. Apple offered them a $5 store credit or $30 in cash if their children had spent at least that much without their permission.\n\nAbout 37,000 people filed claims. This is according to Cook.\n\nApple said the FTC was being unfair. Cook said Apple already solved the problem by giving parents credits or cash. He said that Apple was being sued twice for the same thing.\n\nApple's store has made a lot of money for the company. Apple keeps nearly one-third of the money from all app purchases. Apple says people spent more than $10 billion in the app store last year. That means Apple made about $3 billion from the app store alone.\n\nIn the FTC case, Apple must give back to parents whatever their kids spent without permission. Apple must pay at least $32.5 million. If there is money left over, the FTC will get the difference.'"

            "text": "\tSAN JOSE, Calif. - The crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 showed that safety improvements over the last 30 years made a big difference.\n\nThree people died in the crash. That is sad. But 304 people lived. There were \"nowhere near\" as many deaths as you would have expected, said Larry Rooney. He works for an important pilots group.\n\nSeveral things helped save lives. The passenger seats were stronger and fireproof.  Materials inside the cabin and around the cargo areas slowed flames from spreading. Lighted strips on the floor led to the door where people should leave.  Flight attendants were also taught to speak up when they saw something wrong. And pilots were taught to pay attention to them.\n\nThe plane that crashed July 6 is one of the safest planes in the sky, said Kevin Hiatt. He runs the Flight Safety Foundation.\n\n## Airplane Accidents Rare\n\nThere are still problems to study. Some escape slides opened inside the airplane. Two flight attendants got trapped by those slides for a short time. Getting people out of the plane was delayed for 90 seconds.  Seat belts in most of the seats hurt some passengers. Of course, they also helped save their lives.\n\nAirplane accidents do not happen a lot. \"This one will be closely looked at,\" said Todd Curtis. He worked on safety features at Boeing. Now he operates a Web site that has information for travelers on safety and security. Rules could change because of the crash, he said.\n\nThe airplane had its first flight on Feb 5, 2006. It was built when safety features developed in the late 1980s and 1990s were being put into new airliners.\n\n## Among The Safety Features:\n\n## Stronger Seats\n\nFirefighters entering the airplane found the seats toward the front of the airplane in almost perfect shape. It was \"like you could fluff the pillows and almost go out,\" National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said. The damage was worse near the back.\n\nHiatt said passengers may have climbed over the seats, pushing them forward.\n\n## Easier Escape\n\nThe path lighting on the floor worked. The feature was added to airplanes built in 1986 and later.  The speaker system was still working. Passengers could hear the important order to get out of  the plane.\n\n## Safer Materials\n\nThe passengers had time to escape even though the plane burned. In the 1980s, the FAA issued rules requiring materials inside the cabin be hard to burn. Improvements continue today.\n\nAlso, materials inside the passenger area are made to not crack. That way there are no sharp edges.\n\n## Training For Flight Crews\n\n\"The crews are better trained than they were,\" said Rooney, who has flown for 30 years. That includes the flight attendants.\n\nCrews are now trained to give information to each other. It does not matter who is in charge. The order to get out of Flight 214 was given after a flight attendant noticed fire outside the cabin and passed word to the captain. He reversed an earlier instruction not to evacuate.\n\nInvestigators want to know why there was a delay. \"When the aircraft has gone through that crash landing, the chances of a fire starting are almost 100 percent. Why not order an evacuation?\" asked Vahid Motevalli. He was one of the people who wrote a 2005 study of airplane accidents.\n\n## Better Equipment\n\nImproved navigation technology and better instruments for flying in bad weather have made flight much safer.'"

            "text": "\tSAN JOSE, Calif. -- Scientists are planning to park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.\n\nMost of us want to dodge space rocks. But NASA has an ambitious plan with a $105 million price tag. It wants to build a spaceship and drag an asteroid closer to Earth. It's a first step of a future voyage to Mars.\n\nThe space agency wants to get to the asteroid so it can \"then get it into the hands of the people who can understand it,\" said David Korsmeyer. He's a director at NASA's Ames Research Center. Scientists at Ames will be working on the project.\n\nAsteroids demand respect. A big one could knock Earth off its orbit. In February, a little one rocked Russia. That same month, a bigger one just missed Earth. The close call made people take asteroids even more seriously.\n\nBut asteroids are also valuable. Chasing one could launch us into deeper space.\n\n## A Stepping-Stone into Space\n\nThat's because we'll need a vehicle a lot better than a fuel-driven rocket. With new NASA money, engineers hope to design a futuristic solar-electric ship. It would make a slow and steady trip to find an asteroid. There would be no worries about running out of fuel. The idea of this journey thrills scientists.\n\nAfter finding the right space rock, the spaceship might push, tug or spear the asteroid. Or it might stuff the rock into a big bag. It could even use a lasso like some kind of space cowboy.\n\n## Waiting for Stars to Align in Washington\n\n\"It has been more than 40 years since we have been to deep space,\" said Stanford University professor G. Scott Hubbard. \"We need to regain our 'chops,' \" he said, speaking of the U.S. space program. \"It's a demonstration of space exploration technologies for the future.\"\n\nThe \"Asteroid Retrieval Mission\" is still in talks in Washington, D.C. The sun has set on NASA's shuttle program. The fleet is now on display in museums. The agency also grounded a moon-landing plan. So catching an asteroid would represent a new goal for NASA.\n\nThe California Institute of Technology suggested the idea last year. It has support from the White House. In his only space speech, President Barack Obama promised we would land on an asteroid by 2025. But some in Congress are not so keen. They think the U.S. can't afford to chase asteroids.\n\n## Sky-High Prices\n\nDeveloping the technology needed to bring home an asteroid will raise costs, warned Hubbard. The $105 million is just enough to get the project started. It could end up costing billions of dollars.\n\nIn the summer, Ames and other NASA research centers will work out the details. At Ames, \"we can provide tools that make the mission more successful,\" Korsmeyer said.\n\nFor instance, Ames scientists could make tools like their CheMin device on the Mars rover. It examines Martian rocks. Ames could also build sensors to help find an asteroid. Most asteroids travel too far away to be useful. And some are huge.\n\nBut little ones might be practical to grab using unmanned spaceships, NASA says. In asteroid terms, \"little\" is about the size of a dump truck.\n\n## Lining It All Up\n\nAsteroids are the rubble left from the birth of our solar system. They hold clues about our origins. They could even contain valuable metals.\n\nThe main goal of NASA's plan is not to protect the Earth from a space rock. But what scientists learn could come in handy one day, said Tom Jones. He is a scientist and former astronaut. The technology they build could be useful if they ever need to knock a big asteroid off its course toward Earth, he explained.\n\nThe hunt won't be easy. The perfect asteroid will be too small to reflect light. Plus, it doesn't want to be captured. NASA calls it \"an uncooperative object.\" It will be moving at 17,000 miles per hour. It may not even be solid rock, but just a tumbling bunch of ice.\n\nThen there's the trick of catching it. Korsmeyer calls it a complicated \"math game.\" Think of catching a baseball while on a Ferris wheel.\n\nOnce captured, it would be slowly pushed or pulled, and nudged close to the moon. There, unmanned ships would arrive to chip off chunks for study. Eventually, astronauts would visit it.\n\n\"It's not a trivial undertaking,\" Korsmeyer said. \"You are lining up a whole set of moving balls to try to put one in the pocket.\"'"

            "text": "\tALAMOGORDO, N.M. - A company called Atari made a video game more than 30 years ago. It was based on the move \"E.T. The Extraterrestrial.\" Some call it the worst video game ever made.\n\nA lot of the game cartridges were buried in a New Mexico dump. Now, they have been found. A film company making a movie about Atari dug them up.\n\nBefore Xbox or PlayStation put games online or on discs, video games were kept on cartridges. These were like tapes that were put into a machine called a console to play the video game. In the 1980s, the most popular video game console was made by Atari.\n\nFilm director Zak Penn showed one of the \"E.T.\" cartridges. He said that hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt.\n\nAbout 200 local residents and game fans gathered early Saturday in southeastern New Mexico. They watched big machines dig through the concrete-covered landfill. The equipment was used to search for up to a million discarded copies of the game. Atari had wanted to hide the copies forever.\n\nPenn said he was \"relieved\" that the people got to see something. Meanwhile, people working on the movie looked through mounds of trash. They pulled out boxes, games and other Atari products.\n\n## Atari's Downfall\n\nMost of the crowd left the dump before the discovery. Strong winds had kicked up huge clouds of dust and garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the game on a TV and 1980s game machine in the back of a van.\n\nOne person who watched was Armando Ortega. He is a city official. Back in 1983 he got a tip from a landfill worker. The worker said a lot of games were being dumped there.\n\n\"It was pitch dark here that night, but we came with our flashlights and found dozens of games,\" he said. They braved darkness, coyotes and snakes. They even had to sneak past the guard. But it paid off.\n\nHe says they found dozens of crushed games. They took the games home. The games still worked.\n\nVideo game fans have been fascinated for 30 years by the \"E.T.\" game and what it meant for Atari's downfall. The search for the games will be featured in an upcoming movie. The movie is about Atari. It was the biggest video game company of the early '80s.\n\nXbox Entertainment Studios is one of the companies helping to make the movie. It is expected to be released later this year on Xbox.\n\nPeople on the Internet wonder whether Atari decided to bury thousands or millions of copies of the failed game. More important is the question: why?\n\n## Impossible Traps\n\nKristen Keller is a spokeswoman at Atari. She said \"nobody here has any idea what that's about.\" Atari has been sold many times over the years.\n\nAtari currently has about 200 game titles. They include Centipede and Asteroids. Atari was sold to a French company by Hasbro in 2001.\n\nThe city of Alamogordo agreed to give the film makers some of the games that were found.\n\nAlamogordo Mayor Susie Galea said finding something in the landfill might bring more tourists to this city. \"Lots of people just pass through, unfortunately,\" she said.\n\nThe \"E.T.\" game is one of the things blamed for Atari becoming less popular.\n\nTina Amini works at a gaming website. She said the game \"was practically broken.\" The main character in the game was E.T., a friendly alien. He would fall into traps that were almost impossible to escape. The traps would appear constantly. You did not know when they would show up.\n\nThe company produced millions of the games. Sales were not bad to start. But a lot of the games were returned. \"Even if the game was insanely successful,\" Amini said, she doubts the company would have ever sold enough of them.'"

            "text": "\tCompanies that make airplanes are changing the way they do things: They no longer build wings and jet bodies out of metal. Instead, they build them out of carbon-fiber composites. This lightweight material is made from a blend of carbon and plastic. Just like cloth, it is woven together.\n\nOne thing is hard to find, though: good tools to cut and shape the new material.\n\nNow, a Washington engineering firm called Electroimpact says it has built a better tool. It says its new machine can handle carbon-fiber composites better than anything else out there.\n\nThe new invention is known as an automated fiber placement, or AFP, machine. What makes it special is its round robotic head. This has many spools of half-inch carbon-fiber ribbon attached to it. It can move around any shape very exactly. And it works at very, very fast speeds.\n\n## How It Works\n\nFirst, a laser measures the surface the fiber is to be laid on. Next, a computer works out a series of instructions. These guide the machine as it tailors the fiber.\n\nThen, the head starts moving back and forth. As it moves, it lays down strips of fiber. The surface the strips are laid on rotates as needed.\n\nThe machine can reach an amazing top speed: 595 pounds of carbon fiber laid down per hour.\n\nThat is \"a very large number. ... probably the fastest we've seen,\" said journalist Jeff Sloan. Typically, a speed of 90 pounds per hour would be fast, he said.\n\nBill Hasenjaeger works for a company called CGTech. His company developed the computer software that guides the new machine. He claims perfection is more important than speed. If the new machine can do the work perfectly, he said, 595 pounds per hour is \"a pretty darned impressive number.\"\n\n## Making Wings Next?\n\nBen Hempstead is chief of staff at Electroimpact. He insists no one can match the company's AFP machine.\n\n\"You won't see this anywhere else on the planet,\" he said.\n\nTodd Rudberg is Electroimpact's project manager. He would like to see the company's AFP machines used to make wing skins and wing spars. Spars are two long beams that run the length of a wing. One is in the front of the wing; the other is in the rear. Each is more than 100 feet long.\n\nThe Electroimpact machine could make each of those spars as a single piece, Rudberg said. They would be an \"uninterrupted beautiful structure.\"\n\nThe AFP machine used in a recent demonstration is Electroimpact's smallest model. It costs $5 million. The company has built bigger models that cost up to $25 million.\n\n## Secret Projects\n\nElectroimpact is already making equipment for all the world's major plane makers, like Boeing and Airbus. Some of the projects are secret.\n\nPeter Zieve is Electroimpact's founder and boss. He said he hopes to add two big new buildings to the six the company already has. He plans to empty out the largest of the old ones. That way, it can be \"filled with a huge Boeing project.\"\n\nHe wouldn't say which project.'"

Her friends are - boys.\n\n\"I'm only creating the design idea,\" Barbie says in the book. \"I'll need Steven and Brian's help to turn it into a real game.\"\n\nAlso in the book, Barbie's computer gets a virus, and she needs the boys to help her fix it.\n\nThe bloggers said Barbie wasn't setting a good example for young girls. The book was sending a message, they said, that boys are better with computers than girls.\n\n##Let's Tell That Story Differently\n\nCasey Feisler is a research student in Atlanta, Georgia. She studies technology. She saw the online discussion of \"I Can Be a Computer Engineer.\" She agreed that the book was sending a bad message to young people.

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - A library without books? It once would have been unthinkable. But the new public library in San Antonio has gone completely book-free.\n\nSix months ago, BiblioTech became the nation's first totally digital public library. The name plays off the word \"biblioteca.\" That means library in Spanish.\n\nThe library lets readers check out e-books over the Internet wherever they are. U.S. soldiers can even download the latest titles from [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan).\n\nNo computer? No problem.\n\nReaders in San Antonio can check out tablets or e-readers for free. They can also use the library's computers. Children can check out Nook readers already loaded with 150 books for kids.\n\n## Big Benefit For Lifelong Learners\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library cleared shelves of books last June. It created a wide, bookless area. The library calls the section \"Digital Commons.\" It's part computer lab, part design center and part reading room.\n\nThe book has been around for more than 500 years. And it's not going away anytime soon. But new technology is slowly taking over.\n\nSeveral digital projects have began. They scan in records, original writings and books, including rare treasures. The materials can be found online by anyone with a computer. The Digital World Library just reached its 10,000th entry last week.\n\n\"This project is of enormous benefit to students, teachers, scholars and lifelong learners,\" said James H. Billington. He is the librarian at the country's biggest library, the Library of Congress. Billington added he's pleased to see that it continues to grow.\n\nAt the MLK library, there's a giant touch screen for teaching classes and a 3-D printer. A 3-D printer creates three-dimensional objects. The library also has a sound studio, a machine that will print and bind a book, and work areas. In the children's section, kids can read and play on a touch-screen table.\n\nAt North Carolina State University's new library, its 1.5 million books are stored underground. Students can check out books with the help of a robot. The bookBot delivers books in five minutes or less.\n\n\"There are a lot of libraries that are shifting that way,\" said Barbara Stripling. She is president of the American Library Association.\n\n## Collects Books, Reads E-Books\n\nThe person who came up with the idea for San Antonio's bookless library was Nelson Wolff. He is the county's top official. He's in his 70s.\n\nIt all started with a book about Steve Jobs, said Wolff. Jobs created Apple Inc. Wolf was interested in how quickly he developed new technology.\n\nSo, within about a year, Wolff began the bookless library in a poor part of San Antonio. The library was up and running by last September. It just added another branch in the jury room of the courthouse. Citizens must go to the courthouse every few years to sit on a jury. It often involves a lot of waiting.\n\nAt first, BiblioTech's collection only had 10,000 e-books. But the library has since added another 10,000. And it hopes to add another 10,000 e-books each month.\n\nWolff collects rare 20th-century books.\n\n\"I (used to) refused to read e-books,\" he said.\n\nNow?\n\n\"I don't read hardcover books,\" Wolff said. \"I buy them but I don't read them.\"\n\n## \"People Connecting And Sharing\"\n\nThat kind of thinking may be spreading. BiblioTech attracts a steady flow of online visitors from around the world.\n\n\"The main thing is people are using it,\" Wolff said.\n\nHe's especially tickled that the jury duty branch is taking off.\n\n\"It's been a big hit with all the jurors sitting around,\" he said.\n\nThe library has gotten back the e-readers and tablets it loaned out.\n\n\"We've had a 100 percent return rate,\" said Laura Jesse, the county spokeswoman.\n\nIn D.C., visitors to the MLK library come from all income levels. Its computers are the only way many poor people can use the Internet. They can't afford to buy computers for their homes.\n\nNick Kerelchuk is the manager of Digital Commons. The MLK library scene is \"people connecting and sharing together,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tDesigning toys is not an easy job. MGA Entertainment is the company that makes Bratz dolls. They are trying to come up with ideas for their newest toys.\n\nBratz dolls have been around for 15 years. They are known for their big heads, big lips and big attitudes. After more than a decade of sales, the company is trying to refresh the brand.\n\n## Redesigning The Dolls\n\nBratz dolls used to be very popular. However, in recent years, fewer people are buying them. There are two mains reasons sales of Bratz dolls are shrinking. First, MGA Entertainment ran into legal trouble with a competitor. Second, kids' taste in toys changes very fast. After lots of design work, Bratz dolls are returning to stores.  They have a new look and a new attitude. The company hopes they become popular again.\n\nThe new Bratz are different than the older dolls. Today's dolls are wearing more clothes and less makeup. They also are more modern. Some Bratz dolls have smartphones and accessories printed with emojis.\n\n## Today's Girls Want Different Dolls\n\nIsaac Larian works at MGA Entertainment. He said Bratz has had to change over the years. According to Larian, girls demand much more than they did in the past.\n\nBratz is trying to be a popular brand and sell more dolls. So they are relaunching Bratz. The company hopes to sell more dolls than Mattel, the maker of Barbie. \n\nThe new Bratz line is designed for today's girl. They even have a  new #SelfieSnaps doll. It comes with a tiny camera and a shirt that says \"Selfie.\" MGA also created Bratz YouTube videos and an app. The app lets kids make digital Bratz characters. \n\n## New Dolls Need Technology\n\nToys are more complex than they used to be. Many of today's biggest toys use technology. According to Larian, kids expect toys to be digital.  \n\nThis is not the first time Bratz has tried to make a comeback. In 2010, they tried to make the dolls taller and introduce a new logo. It was not successful so they stopped sales in 2014. \n\nIn the past, the company tried to make Bratz dolls look like other popular toys. However, it did not work. Bratz dolls are not Disney princesses. They have a different attitude and vibe.\n\n## Sales Have Dropped\n\nIn 2006, Bratz sold $1 billion of dolls. Sales have dropped fast. Larian predicts that now, Bratz sells about $150 million each year.\n\nBratz competes with Mattel since they are both toymakers. Bratz's success has stolen customers from Mattel over the years. The companies have also been in legal fights.  \n\nMattel says that MGA stole the idea for Bratz from them. For years, the companies have been arguing about whose idea it really was. Today, the legal fight still rages on. \n\n## Legal Fights With Barbie\n\nThen last year, MGA accused Mattel of stealing company secrets. Mattel makes Barbie dolls, which is a top seller. MGA said that Mattel sent spies into their showroom. They say the spies came to steal ideas to bring back to Mattel.\n\nMattel does not admit this happened. \n\nDespite these challenges, toy experts say Bratz will have to work hard to sell many dolls. There are many toy options for families and kids. Bratz has competition with other toy companies. Also, kids have a short attention span. They might like a toy one day and then be onto something else the next. \n\n## Believing In Bratz\n\nAnother challenge is technology. Kids have many distractions today. Smartphones and tablet are popular play things. Toy companies have to find a way to keep kids interested.  \n\nLarian still believes in Bratz, though. \n\n\"It's a super brand,\" he said. \"It will be around forever.\"'"

Today, Camden is one of the country's poorest and most dangerous cities.\n\nYoung people growing up in Camden face many difficulties. Hopeworks 'N Camden is a program that tries to help. It offers technology and training classes to young people. At Hopeworks, students learn how to design websites. At the same time, they receive help finding jobs and finishing school.\n\nThis weekend, Hopeworks will have what is called a hackathon. It will be the first in Camden's history. A hackathon is an event in which a group of computer programmers gather and work together. Some hackathons last for a day. Others go on for a whole week.\n\n## Programmers From All Over America Will Join Students\n\nProgrammers from around the country will come to Camden to take part in Hopeworks' hackathon. Programmers design the technology that runs on computers, such as websites. Some programmers from the car company Subaru are coming. Subaru will soon move its offices to Camden.\n\nThe hackathon will give Hopeworks' students a chance to learn from other computer programmers. At the same time, they will be giving back to their city. Programmers at the hackathon will work on websites that help the people of Camden. For example, they will make a new website for the Mayor's Youth Council. It works to improve services for young people in Camden.\n\n## Hackathon Today, A Career Tomorrow\n\nDan Rhoten is in charge of Hopeworks. He hopes that the hackathon will make Camden proud. He also wants to show that students of all backgrounds can work with computers.\n\nRhoten said he plans to hold hackathons every six months or so. Programmers could help Camden in many ways. For example, the city might want one of its websites to be updated. Hackathon programmers could make it happen in a single weekend.\n\nThese days, Camden is undergoing many changes. The state government has taken over the city's schools, because they were doing badly. The county government has taken over the police force. Meanwhile, several businesses are moving to Camden. Along with Subaru, American Water and a company called Holtec are coming to Camden. The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team is building a place there to practice.\n\n## Young People Can Help City Make Changes\n\nAs these changes unfold, young people in Camden can help the city, too. One student at Hopeworks is named Gabrielle Lee. She wants to leave Camden for now. Later in her life, she hopes to return to teach English as a second language. She said that being at Hopeworks makes her want to share her skills.\n\nWest Lalanne is another Hopeworks student. He said that hackathons can bring people together.\""

            "title": "A Chinese technique puts its stamp on cell printing",
            "text": "\tWoodblock printing was developed more than 1,800 years ago in China. It is a form of printing that uses blocks of wood with raised surfaces in a pattern. Woodblock printing is like using a rubber stamp. The woodblock is covered in ink and then pressed against paper. It leaves behind a picture or words.\n\nNot long ago, scientists discovered that the ancient printing system can be a useful tool. In today's laboratories it can be used to work with living cells.\n\nA cell is the smallest unit of living things on Earth. Both plants and animals are made of cells.\n\nScientists usually use inkjet printers when working with living cells. Live cells are useful in testing new drugs or studying diseases. The inkjet printers squeeze the tiny, living cells out into patterns for lab experiments. But that system has some problems. So scientists have turned to Chinese woodblock printing.\n\n## A Chinese Inspiration\n\nWoodblock printing is helpful to scientists for many reasons. It makes it easier to keep cells alive during experiments.\n\nWoodblock printing also gives scientists more choices. They can print a mixture of animal cells in many different shapes. And they can print them on just about any surface.\n\nInkjet printing involves squeezing fluid filled with cells. Those cells are \"the ink.\" The cells are placed onto a surface in a pattern.\n\nScientists have used inkjet printing when they're trying to set down a layer of cells - like a layer of a cake. But it's hard to get the cells to lie flat in layers of single cells.\n\nInkjet printing makes it difficult to put the cells exactly where you want. It can also kill cells. Up to half may die.\n\nSo a team of scientists from Texas and Taiwan turned to Chinese woodblock printing.\n\nThe study was led by scientist Kai Zhang. He said that woodblock printing is a technology \"that revolutionized the printing world.\"\n\n## Designing Woodblock Stamps\n\nThe scientists designed woodblock-like stamps made out of silicone. Little hooks were placed along the sides of the stamps.\n\nScientists then pushed liquid filled with cells through the stamp's design. Pressure was used to suck the cell through to the other side of the stamp.\n\nThe hooks catch a single cell as it flies by. Think of the cell as a baseball and the hook as a catcher's mitt. The cell flies into the hook just like a baseball falls into a mitt.\n\nOnce a hook is filled, the other cells pass by. They fill other empty hooks.\n\nThe mold is then pressed onto a surface and then lifted away. This leaves behind a pattern of cells.\n\nBy using the silicone stamps, scientists were able to work with HeLa cancer cells. They placed the HeLa cells in organized grids.\n\n## First Lab-Grown Cells\n\nThe HeLa cells were the first ones ever grown in a lab. They were taken from a patient named Henrietta Lacks. She later died of cancer in 1951. Scientists noticed that her cells were different. They could be kept alive and grow. Her cells have been used by scientists in experiments all around the world.\n\nPrinting the HeLa cells allows scientists to look at how cancer spreads through the body.\n\nNeurons were also used while working with the woodblock stamps. Neurons are cells that send information to and from the brain.\n\nScientists placed neurons into a grid shape. Then they watched how they share information. They hope this will let them understand how brain diseases work.\n\nThe scientists call this new type of printing block-cell printing. They found that it could be done in just half an hour. Unlike inkjet printing, it doesn't kill any of the cells being used.\n\nThere are some drawbacks. Block-cell printing cannot print several layers of cells. Printing also takes longer than with an inkjet printer. But it could be cheaper, the scientists said. The materials to make each stamp's mold cost roughly $1. An inkjet cell printer can cost thousands of dollars.'"

            "text": "\tSony's new video game system, PlayStation 4, went on sale November 15. A week later, Microsoft released the Xbox One. Now, the two rival companies will battle for customers' dollars this holiday season.\n\nSony describes PlayStation 4 as a system for serious gamers. But Microsoft says people can play more than just games on its Xbox One. Xbox One is more expensive than PlayStation 4. It will cost $499. The Playstation 4 is $399.\n\nPeople used to think that only teenage boys liked to play video games. Now, a game customer can be almost anyone. About half the homes in the U.S. have video game systems. Many of the people who like video games are women and older people.\n\nSome experts had predicted that people would give up on game systems. They blamed free games like Candy Crush Saga. Games are on smartphones. So, what's the need for a big system under the TV? But games on phones and Facebook haven't hurt game system sales. In fact, more people play games now, one expert said.\n\n## Systems Same, But Different\n\nSony showed off the PlayStation 4 in San Francisco. It is much more powerful and runs faster than PlayStation 3. It has new games like \"Killzone Shadow Fall\" that no other company has. And it said its system lets gamers share video with friends even when people are still playing a game.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft demonstrated its new system in Venice, Calif. The Xbox One can do many things. It can recognize a person when he or she enters the room. It automatically loads the games people in the house like to play on the TV screen. Users can change from playing a game to watching TV or listening to a song just by talking.\n\nThe two systems share much in common. Both machines do more than play games. People can use services like Netflix with them. And people can record and share game highlights with their friends with both machines.\n\nThe last time the companies made new gaming systems, there were many problems.\n\nMicrosoft rushed to get its product out first in late 2005. But it wasn't perfect. Many systems broke down. It cost the company a great deal of money.\n\nSony's PlayStation 3 came out a year later in November 2006. It cost much more money than Xbox 360. It ran out of an important part in the system.\n\nBoth game systems overcame those problems. The two companies each sold about 80 million systems worldwide.'"

            "text": "\tLast week, Apple's leader Tim Cook made an announcement. He told the world that he is gay.\n\nMany technology companies support gay rights in the United States. Cook's announcement may help them go further. They may soon work for gay rights in the rest of the world.\n\nCook's announcement was about more than just himself. He was also saying something important about companies: They can succeed whether the boss is gay or straight.\n\nChris Sinton fights for gay rights. He thinks Cook's announcement could make a big difference.\n\nApple is \"the most valuable company on the planet,\" Sinton said. Now everyone knows that \"it's run by a gay man.\"\n\nKnowing that Cook is gay could mean a lot to people around the world, Sinton said. A child in Russia could read the news and change his view on what a gay person can do.\n\n## Big Companies Can Make Changes\n\nTech companies are some of the richest and most powerful companies these days. Cook's announcement gives them a new opportunity. They can now push for gay rights everywhere.\n\nTech companies may be able to influence countries where gays are not accepted. Russia and Pakistan are two examples of such countries.\n\nIn Russia and Pakistan, gays are treated badly. In both countries, tech products are quite popular. Because of that, people may listen to tech companies. Apple and others may be able to change ideas about gays.\n\nLeanne Pittsford is another fighter for gay rights. \"These big tech companies have offices overseas,\" she said. Their products are very popular all over the world. Cook's announcement could make tech companies do more. They could begin to \"get more involved overseas,\" she said.\n\n## Open-Minded And Supportive\n\nIn the United States, tech companies have long supported gay rights. They still do more than most other kinds of companies.\n\nFor example, Apple marches in the yearly San Francisco Pride parade. The colorful parade celebrates gay life. Google has its Legalize Love effort, which concentrates on countries where being gay is against the law.\n\nJonathan Lovitz is also a supporter of gay rights - he is a gay-rights activist. Tech companies have always been open to new ideas, he says. In fact, that is what their success depends on. They have to be able to think about technology in new ways. Perhaps that makes them more open-minded in general.\n\nTech companies have long treated gay people well, Lovitz says. Other businesses are only now catching up. These include banks and law firms.\n\n## Being Fair To Everyone\n\nMany gay workers feel at home in tech companies. They are comfortable telling coworkers they are gay.\n\nCook is not the first tech leader to come out as gay. A number of well-known tech leaders had already done so.\n\nOne is Megan Smith, now the nation's chief technology officer. Another is Peter Thiel, PayPal's cofounder. Then there is Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator. Plus Wesley Chan, a big supporter of new tech companies. Finally, there's Nancy Vitale, a boss at Genentech.\n\nHowever, tech companies still have their problems. There is plenty of work to be done before they become truly fair, activists say.\n\nTech companies are certainly good when it comes to gay rights. However, they have done little in other areas. They still need to hire many more women, blacks and Latinos, said Jennifer Brown, a diversity expert.\n\nStill, Cook's announcement may encourage many. It could move people one step closer to fairness at work, Brown said. Someday we may have workplaces that treat everyone equally.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Doctors have new advice for parents: Limit kids' time online. They should also keep smartphones and laptops out of bedrooms.\n\nThis will make many teens roll their eyes. But an important pediatricians group says too much Internet use can have serious results.\n\nIt has been linked with online bullying, problems at school, poor sleep and other problems. It's not a big cause of these troubles. But \"many parents are clueless\" about what Internet use can do to their children, said Dr. Victor Strasburger.\n\nHe is the lead writer of the new American Academy of Pediatrics policy. It sets out guidelines on what parents should let their kids do.\n\n## \"Get With It\" Parents, Doctor Says\n\n\"This is the 21st century and they need to get with it,\" he said of parents. Strasburger is a University of New Mexico doctor. He specializes in teenage medicine.\n\nThe guidelines are aimed at all kids who use smartphones, computers and other devices connected to the Internet. It expands the academy's old suggestions. The group already said not to put televisions in children's and teens' bedrooms. It also suggests not watching TV for more than two hours a day.\n\nNow those two hours include using the Internet for entertainment. Facebook, TV and movies count against the two hours. Online homework does not.\n\nA report about about kids and screen use came out in 2010. It found that U.S. children ages 8 to 18 spend more than seven hours a day using some kind of screen for entertainment. Many kids now watch TV online. They send text messages from their bedrooms after \"bedtime.\" Yet few parents set rules about using media.\n\nMost kids 12 to 17 own cellphones. Nearly all teens send text messages. Many younger kids have phones that are connected to the Internet.\n\n## Two-Hour Limit A Disaster, Teen Says\n\nMark Risinger, 16, is allowed to use his smartphone and laptop in his room. He says he spends about four hours a day on the Internet. He does homework, uses Facebook and YouTube and watches movies.\n\nHe said a two-hour Internet time limit would be a disaster. Kids will not follow the advice, \"they'll just find a way to get around it.\"\n\nStrasburger said he realizes many kids will laugh at advice from doctors. They won't take advice seriously from any adults. But he hopes it will lead to more limits set by parents and schools.\n\nThe policy comes out two weeks after police arrested two Florida girls. They were accused of bullying a classmate. The classmate later killed herself. Police say one of the girls recently boasted online about the bullying. The local sheriff asked why the girls' parents had not limited their Internet use.\n\n## Let Parents Decide Limits, Mom Says\n\nMark's mom is Amy Risinger. She said she agrees with restricting kids' time on social media like Facebook. But deciding on other media limits should be up to parents, she said.\n\nHer 12-year-old has sneaked a laptop into bed a few times. He has ended up groggy in the morning. Now the family has a new rule. His device needs to be with his parents before he goes to bed.\n\nSara Gorr is a San Francisco sales director. She has two daughters, ages 13 and 15. She said she welcomes the academy's guidelines.\n\nHer girls were not allowed to watch TV until a few years ago. The younger one has a tablet. The older one has a computer and smartphone. They are told not to use them after 9 p.m.\n\n\"There needs to be more awareness,\" Gorr said. \"Kids are getting way too much computer time.\"'"

            "text": "\tChey Castro plays golf. He has a problem when he plays. When he tries to hit an easy shot, he gets something called the yips.\n\nAn example came in a recent game. The ball was only 5 feet from the hole. He used his putter to make a short shot, or putt. His hand shook when he tried to hit the ball. He missed the putt.\n\n\"I know I'm good, and I know I can make these putts,\" says Castro. \"I used to always make them.\"\n\nThe name the yips might make the problem sound small. In fact, the yips can ruin an athlete's career.\n\n## Many Golfers Get It\n\nWhen golfers get the yips, their hands shake uncontrollably. It happens right before the club hits the ball, says Dr. Debbie Crews. She helps athletes train their minds so they can play better. Crews has helped Castro and others treat the yips.\n\nThe yips affect many kinds of athletes, including baseball players. Even piano players can get the yips. However, golfers are most known to have the problem.\n\nAround 4 in 10 golfers will experience the yips at some point in their career, Crews says. In the past, most golfers refused to admit they had it. Today, scientists like Crews are trying to understand what causes the yips. They also want to figure out how to treat it.\n\n## Two Causes Of The Yips\n\nScientists say there are two types of yips. One is neurological, or physically related to the nerves and the brain. The other is psychological. It is not physical and is in the player's mind.\n\nA small number of golfers who come down with the yips have a problem in the brain. It causes the muscle to get stiff even when the golfers do not want them to. For most though, there's nothing physically wrong. This is what makes the yips so mysterious.\n\nSome golfers have the yips only under certain conditions. For example, they may get the yips if they're playing a game for a lot of money. Others might have it on and off for a few months. For some, it might happen all the time.\n\n## A Lack Of Confidence\n\nCastro first had the yips more than 10 years ago. He had played golf since he was 6 and played a lot in high school. When he went to college, he stopped playing so often. That's when he first got the yips.\n\nCastro says the reason is a lack of confidence. In high school, he was practicing every day. Now, he just plays for fun several times a week. The lack of practice makes him less confident.\n\nCrews says being nervous can make the problem worse. Crews used exercises to help make Castro less nervous. She had him concentrate on a spot past the ball and make small changes to how he stood over the ball.\n\n## Training The Brain\n\nCrews also suspects that you can train the brain to work differently. People can do this by making small changes to where they place their feet and hands.\n\nWhen a golfer putts, the brain relies on a model it created. The model figures out what signal is sent to which muscles to tell them what to do. With the yips, this model stops working. Crews says making a small change in hand position seems to adjust the brain.\n\n\"People think they've got to do this one perfect motion this one way, but that's not true,\"  Crews says. \"There are many ways.\"'"

            "text": "\tATLANTA - For years, teachers in Atlanta changed the answers on student tests. They wanted to make it look like students were doing better in school than they actually were.\n\nOn Wednesday, a jury decided that 11 people who were teachers and school officials had cheated. A jury is group of people who listen to a court case. When someone is accused of a crime, the jury must decide whether that person is guilty or innocent.\n\nThe 11 teachers could be sent to prison for many years.\n\nTen of the former teachers and officials were handcuffed and taken to jail. The 11th was at home because she is having a baby.\n\nOnly one former teacher, Dessa Curb, was not found guilty. The jury decided she was innocent.\n\n## Teachers Secretly Erased Wrong Answers\n\nDuring the trial, several teachers described how the cheating worked. After students finished taking tests, teachers secretly erased the wrong answers. They then wrote in the right answers. Many of the students could not read, write or do basic math. Their tests did not show that. Because of the good test scores, students were often passed on to the next grade.\n\nThe teachers did not just cheat the school system. They cheated the students. The fake test scores made schools miss out on government money. This money could have paid for tutoring or other programs to help students catch up. Lawyers said the district lost $8 million in 2009 alone.\n\nThe case began in 2008. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper raised questions about the unbelievably high test scores. The state began reviewing the students' test answer sheets. It found that too many wrong answers were erased and replaced with correct answers.\n\n## 2011 Report Said Cheating Was Widespread\n\nFourth grade tests at one school were especially bad. The students had almost no chance at scoring as well as the tests said they did.\n\nSpecial investigators spoke to hundreds of Atlanta Public Schools workers. A 2011 report found widespread cheating. It also said that thousands of schoolchildren missed out on the education they deserved.\n\nLawyers for the state said the superintendent was to blame. She demanded that the test scores become higher and higher. If students got bad test scores, some teachers were fired. They also were publicly embarrassed.\n\n\"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic,\" said Erroll Davis. He served as district  superintendent after Hall was fired.\n\n## Mayor Wants City To Move Forward\n\nKasim Reed is the mayor of Atlanta. He said hoped jury's decision would allow Atlanta to \"finally close this chapter.\"\n\nRichard Quartarone is a father of two kids in an Atlanta school. He said it brings his city no closer to healing. The cheating had gone on for too many years.\n\nJudge Jerry Baxter was the judge in the case. He made it clear he will show little sympathy to the former teachers.\n\nThey are guilty of serious crimes, Baxter said. He said he does not like to send anyone to jail, but the teachers knew what they were doing was wrong.\n\nGerald Griggs is the lawyer of Angela Williamson. She used to be a teacher. She told students what the right answers were on the tests.\n\nGriggs said he respected the court decision. Still he asked, \"How do you send teachers to prison?\"\n\nThe Atlanta school system called the case a \"sad and tragic chapter\" that is now over. It said that the new superintendent and the school board are working together to make sure the teachers do not cheat again.'"

            "text": "\tHAVANA, Cuba - Cuba has produced some of the world's great baseball players. Many Cuban players do not play in their own country, however. Officials have made new rules to try to keep Cuban players from leaving.\n\nCuba is a poor country. Its baseball league pays less than leagues in other countries. As a result, some players leave Cuba with dreams of making more money.\n\nMany start playing in the United States and Canada, commonly known as the major leagues. As players leave, the talent level of the Cuban league goes down.\n\n## Cuba's Revolution And Baseball\n\nThis is sad for Cuban baseball fans. The island has a long and proud baseball history. In fact, baseball is the official sport of Cuba. The country continues to have great players. The problem is that so many of them do not play in Cuba.\n\nTo understand the situation, there are a few things you need to know about Cuba's history. From 1953 to 1959, there was a revolution in Cuba. The fighters took over the government and set up a new kind of country. Baseball changed a lot under the new system. The new government banned players from playing outside of Cuba.\n\nThis was meant to keep baseball talent on the island. In some ways, it had the opposite effect.\n\nBallplayers who wanted to play in other countries started to leave Cuba illegally. If a player wanted to play in the major leagues, for example, he would have to leave Cuba in secret. He could never return.\n\nIn September 2013, rules were changed to try to fix the problem. Cuba gave its players more freedom. In exchange, it hoped that fewer players would leave.\n\n## New Rules, Same Old Problem\n\nThe new rules allow ballplayers to play in countries like Japan and Mexico. The players have to come back to Cuba during the year and play there as well, though. In addition, the Cuban league has started paying players more money.\n\nThe changes do not seem to be working.\n\nCuban players continue to join the major leagues. This summer, outfielder Rusney Castillo left Cuba. He signed a deal with the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox will pay him $72.5 million over seven years.\n\nBig salaries like Castillo's are hard for Cuban players to say no to. This year, 13 Cuban players were hired by major league teams. Last year, 10 were hired. It seems that the problem for the Cuban national league is getting worse.\n\nMoney is not the only reason that players leave Cuba. Another reason is that many players simply would rather play in the major leagues. They see it as the highest level in baseball. Playing in the major leagues shows that you can play among the world's best ballplayers.\n\n## Dreaming Of The Major Leagues\n\nFor example, Odrisamer Despaigne, 27, left Cuba this past February. Three months later, he was hired by the San Diego Padres.\n\n\"I needed new challenges,\" he explained. \"That's why I left my country, to achieve my dream of playing with the best in the major leagues.\"\n\nThe rule changes have not kept players like Despaigne from leaving. Meanwhile, young Cubans continue to dream of playing baseball in other countries.\n\nTake 15-year-old Ernesto Medina, for example. He dreams of being a great baseball player one day. \"To start, I'm dreaming of playing for Industriales, the greatest Cuban baseball team in my opinion,\" he said. He does not want to stay in Cuba forever, though. \"Afterward of course I'd like to play in the major leagues.\"'"

They carried the World Series trophy through their city in a \"rolling rally\" of \"duck boats.\" The boats have wheels so they can drive like trucks. But, they can also float in the water.\n\nThousands of fans came out to watch the parade.\n\nThe most emotional moment happened early Saturday. The vehicles stopped at the Boston Marathon finish line. The spot was near where two explosions killed three people watching the race on April 15.\n\nOutfielder Jonny Gomes placed the trophy on the finish line. Then he and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia held Red Sox jerseys with the words \"BOSTON STRONG\" and the number 617. All telephone numbers in Boston begin with those numbers. The Red Sox hung a jersey with that message in the dugout during the season.\n\n\"That was an emotional moment,\" Gomes said. \"To bring the World Series trophy to the finish line.\"\n\n## Last-Place Losers Turn Into World Series Winners\n\nThe Red Sox had left Boston to go on a road trip the day of the Marathon. On the way to the airport, they saw ambulances racing to the explosions. Team Manager John Farrell remembered that moment.\n\n\"That's going to bring back a lot, and a lot of uncertainty at that moment,\" Farrell said, \"because no one knew where to turn next.\"\n\nSecond baseman Dustin Pedroia said: \"We played for the whole city, what the city went through.\"\n\nBoston's season was stunning. The team started in last place. They won the World Series with a 6-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 on Wednesday. It was the first time the Red Sox won the Series in Boston in 95 years.\n\nBut Pedroia was not surprised. \"The way we started spring training, it seemed like everybody counted us out,\" he said. \"We always said, 'One day closer to a parade.' It's here.\"\n\n## Lucky Beards\n\nA rally took place in Red Sox stadium before the ceremony. Then the team got onto 25 duck boats. The boats are normally carry tourists. They come in pink, yellow, lime green, white and other colors.\n\nSome even had beards made of carpet attached on the front.\n\nPlayers still had their beards, which some had grown all season long. The beards were something the team used to rally around. They did not want to cut them while they were winning.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can all get together and shave them for a good cause,\" third baseman Will Middlebrooks said.\n\nSome fans also were at rallies after the 2004 and 2007 championships.\n\n\"This may be the best parade yet,\" said Charles Butler, 48, of Boston. This was his third. \"It is the best thing that could have happened to Boston right now.\"\n\nThere were a lot of police at the event, for safety reasons.\n\n## \"Ready To Go Another Lap\"\n\nMany fans in the crowd wore Red Sox gear. Some had foam beards and held signs \"Papi for Mayor.\" That's in honor of World Series MVP David Ortiz, who is called \"Big Papi.\" That is Spanish for daddy.\n\nOrtiz hit a grand slam in the AL championship series against the Detroit Tigers. Without that hit they might not have made it to the World Series.\n\nWhen the vehicles slid into the river, the crowd cheered.\n\nThe trip leaving the stadium was delayed, however. A truck carrying a band that had played at the ceremony became stuck in the ground.\n\nA duck boat drove up in front of it. A rope was attached between the vehicles. Then the boat pulled the truck loose.\n\nLess than three hours later, the rally was over.\n\n\"We were ready to go another lap,\" Gomes said. \"We didn't want it to end. It was pretty fun.\"'"

For the first time, they can use computers to give themselves an advantage.\n\nThis year every NBA team can use information from a company called SportVU. SportVU cameras are installed in every NBA arena. They track large sets of small tidbits of information, known as big data.\n\nThe cameras record the position of the ball and every player on the court. They follow every second of every game of the season.\n\nThe camera data is starting to change basketball. It is changing everything from coaching to player fitness to how fans watch the game.\n\nBen Alamar works for an NBA team. He is excited about data in basketball. The NBA's system shows how helpful data can be.\n\nBig data is helping scientists explore outer space. It is helping companies find out what customers want. It is also helping basketball teams learn some things about their players for the first time.\n\n## Cameras Near The Roof\n\nAll sports are using data to make better decisions, said Brian Kopp. He works for a sports data company. \"Basketball is pushing the front edge of that conversation.\"\n\nSportVU puts cameras near the roof of a gym. The linked cameras collect data 25 times a second. They track where each player is on the court and the position of the ball. Computer \"vision technology\" sees the number and color on players' jerseys.\n\nThe player-tracking data goes from the cameras to a computer workstation in each arena. Then it's uploaded to SportVU's servers. From there, it's put into an even larger database.\n\nThe data gets matched up with the play-by-play information from scorekeepers. Reports are ready 60 seconds after something happens on the court.\n\nFour teams put together the camera system before the 2010-2011 season. Before the start of this season, the league made sure all NBA teams could use it.\n\nThe SportVU system can tell how much players run during games. It can track how well players shoot from particular spots on the court. The system can help coaches know if a player is tired.\n\n## Helping Coaches - And Fans Too\n\nSportVU also shows how good players are on defense. Teams also use SportVU after the season is over to help find players they want to sign for next year.\n\nExperts say the data reinforces what coaches already know in many cases. It is helpful in scouting other teams. Coaches can know the rest of the league like they know their own team.\n\nSportVU proved to teams that the 3-point shot is one of the most useful ways to score points. It also recommended taking open shots. That led to a lot of passing and motion, said Steve Hellmuth, who works for the NBA.\n\nFans can see some of the data on the NBA's website. They can see how well players shoot from different spots on the court. They can also see how good some players are at guarding other players.\n\nThe NBA and its teams may be doing a lot more with the data soon. It could allow coaches to make in-game changes. The data could also allow TV stations to improve what they show during the game. Computers might make some of the calls now made by people.\n\nKopp says this data will become more valuable as time goes on.'"

            "text": "\tLAWRENCE, Kan. - Michael J. Zogry teaches at the University of Kansas. Not long ago he found an audio recording. The voice on the recording belonged to James Naismith. He invented the sport of basketball 124 years ago. Naismith died 76 years ago. On the recording, Naismith says the first game he organized was a mess.\n\n## Peach Baskets In The Gym\n\nZogry got the three-minute audio from the Library of Congress. It is the largest library in the world. The recording was part of a radio show called \"We the People.\" It was recorded in 1939. Naismith described how he set up the game with two peach baskets at a YMCA school in Massachusetts in December 1891.\n\nNaismith was a teacher. He was given two weeks to make up a new indoor activity for his gym class. Thanks to a blizzard his students were stuck inside. Their restlessness made Naismith work faster.\n\n## Bored Students Needed A New Game\n\n\"We tried everything to keep them quiet,\" Naismith said on the recording. The students played football in the gym. Soon they became bored. Naismith wanted to keep them busy. He decided to try his new idea using an old soccer ball and two teams of nine players each.\n\nHe described the object of the game to his students. They would try and throw the ball into the opposing team's peach basket. \"I blew a whistle and the first game of basketball began,\" Naismith said.\n\n## Hey! No Tackling In Basketball!\n\nIt did not go smoothly. Naismith said the players almost immediately started tackling each other. Even worse, two young men got black eyes while another was knocked out. Naismith had to pull players apart, he said.\n\n\"I didn't have enough (rules), and that's where I made my big mistake,\" Naismith said.\n\nNaismith invented the 13 rules of the game shortly after that first crazy game. \n\n## Quick, Fix The Rules!\n\n\"There was the first game, then there was a second game,\" Zogry said. In between games, the players nagged Naismith to fix the rules. He quickly fixed the rules, Zogry added.\n\nNaismith's grandson, Jim, had never heard his grandfather's voice until Zogry found the recording. It changes almost everything that has been written about that first game, he said.\n\n\"When he turned those 18 guys loose, obviously they were having a good time, but obviously this was kind of try number 1. He ... said he didn't write enough rules. It came out of that experience,\" Jim Naismith said. \"That makes a lot of sense.\"\n\n## Finding The Lost Recording\n\nRob Rains wrote a book called \"James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball.\" It was written with Naismith's granddaughter Hellen Carpenter. Rains did not know of any other audio recording of Naismith. The recording suggests Naismith made changes to the game \"much more quickly than we first thought,\" he said.\n\nZogry was surprised to discover the audio. He realized it was the only recording of Naismith's voice that exists today. Audio recordings from that long ago are rare. To find a lost recording and share it with the public is \"very exciting,\" he said. \n\nNaismith worked at the University of Kansas for 40 years. He was the school's first basketball coach. The 13 original rules were given to the school and will displayed on campus.'"

            "text": "\tAKRON, Ohio - A new basketball program is helping sixth-graders in Akron, Ohio. It teaches them to behave and to believe in themselves.\n\nThe boys love basketball. The program uses this love to help them grow into respected and respectful men.\n\nSilas Hardiman is one of the players. Last month, a classmate made fun of how he looked. Silas did not hit him. Instead, the 11-year-old thought about what would happen.\n\n\"If I would have hit him,\" Silas said, \"I would have been kicked off the team or benched.\"\n\nSilas is among 76 students at seven elementary schools who are in the program. Basketball and other sports normally are not available until seventh grade.\n\n## A Perfect Mix\n\nAdministrators think focusing more on middle school is a good idea. It is a time when more boys get into trouble as their bodies and feelings change.\n\nThe basketball program costs less than $10,000 to run. A company called DC Heating & Cooling Inc. gave $1,540 to help. The program already is paying off, said school official Dan Rambler.\n\nOfficials agreed with combining mentoring and athletics to make things better at the schools, he said. It was a perfect mix of what they wanted to do for students, he said.\n\nStudents in the program gather once a week after school. They normally spend 15 minutes on the basketball court. Another 105 minutes is spent in a classroom. They help each other catch up on homework while listening to mentors, or adults who can give advice. These mentors focus on helping black youth. Each Saturday, the seven teams play.\n\nThe weekly practices began in October. The final match is set for March 5.\n\nThe students do not get to play if they get into trouble or fail to meet weekly school goals. Teachers set the school goals. The boys are behaving better. They are also doing better in reading and math, school administrators said.\n\n## Learning Responsibility\n\nKyle Earley decides who can play. He checks weekly progress reports. Earley makes the kids run tough drills for bad behavior.\n\nEarley works with young people at a local church. He graduated from an Akron high school in 1998. Then he coached middle school basketball. Earley saw students skipping school last year. There were other behavioral problems too. \n\nHe suggested the idea of creating a sixth-grade basketball league to Angela Harper. She is the principal at Crouse school. She passed the idea along to Rambler and others in charge of student behavior, programs and athletics.\n\nEarley brought in his sister, Ciara Dennis. She is a psychologist. She works with people on how they think and feel.\n\nDennis came up with a plan. It helps the mentors teach the boys to be responsible for their actions. The boys learn to show anger in other ways, to understand and respect others and to be proud of who they are. Doing these things frees them from the situations that keep many poor young people from achieving their dreams.\n\nThe health agency provides training and support to children and adults. It works in churches, schools and homes in the community.\n\nThe basketball program is part of a larger effort. The idea is to get mentors, especially black men, to help these students at a very important age.'"

The U.S. Justice Department said they were secretly taking money against the law.\n\nNo one knows what led Blatter to quit. An American law enforcement official said the Justice Department is looking into whether Blatter also took money.\n\nBlatter will remain president of FIFA until someone else is elected. FIFA stands for the French name, Federation Internationale de Football Association. It is a sports league, like the American NBA or the NFL. Its teams are in about 200 different countries.\n\nAt FIFA's offices in Switzerland, Blatter said he did nothing wrong. He admitted he had lost the support of \"the entire world of football.\" In most of the world, soccer is called football. Blatter said he plans to make important changes in FIFA while he is still president.\n\n## Leader Says He Wants To Do \"What Is Best\"\n\nBlatter has been the FIFA president since 1998. Blatter said he would limit the number of years someone could be president. He also said FIFA's top committee must be changed because it has too much power. The committee decides on the dates and places of soccer tournaments.\n\nBlatter, who is 79, said he loves FIFA more than anything. \"I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football,\" said Blatter.\n\nOn May 27, the Swiss government arrested several people who work for FIFA. Hours later, the American government announced 47 criminal charges against them and others. The government said FIFA officials took money from countries competing to have the World Cup soccer championship.\n\nBlatter has not been charged with a crime. The Justice Department thinks a top FIFA official was involved in a $10 million secret deal in 2008. That money was paid by people in the South African government. They wanted the 2010 World Cup to be played in their country.\n\nSouth African officials have denied paying for the World Cup. The FIFA official has not been charged with a crime.\n\nFor many years, people have wondered about secret deals in FIFA. They questioned how FIFA's presidents were chosen. They also questioned votes on World Cup sites.\n\nThe soccer world welcomed Blatter's exit.\n\nU.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati called it a chance for FIFA to change.\n\n## Players Hope Soccer Will Be More Honest\n\nIn Latin America, players and officials celebrated.

He said the end of Blatter's job was the first step to changing FIFA.\n\nIn Germany, the news was greeted with relief and even joy.\n\nHans Sarpei is a German-Ghanaian former professional soccer player. He tweeted, \"I'll go to my office now and dance with joy.\"\n\n\"This is the absolutely right decision,\" said Wolfgang Niersbach. He is the president of the German Football Association.

            "text": "\tBERKELEY, Calif. - Ann Kwong grew up blind. The closest she came to a sport was a marshmallow-eating contest. Judith Lung, another blind woman, never learned how to throw a ball.\n\nNow she can.\n\nRight now, very few blind people play on college sports teams. The University of California, Berkeley, hopes to change that. This fall, it started the first goalball team in the country. Goalball is a rough game.\n\n## The Bells Of The Ball\n\nThe game is played with a rubber ball with bells inside. All players wear dark eyeshades and can see nothing during the game. They rely on sound, touch and hearing to get the ball into the goal. The court lines are marked by wires covered in tape. This lets players feel where they are.\n\nGoalball fans hope blind people will be treated fairly in sports. In 1972, Congress passed the Title IX law. It said women and girls have to be treated fairly in school sports. The goalball fans hope there will be a law like it for disabled people.\n\nAt one goalball game, a referee reminded everyone to be quiet. Silence is an important rule. The athletes need to be able to hear what is happening on the court since they cannot see.\n\nThe referee rolled the ball to the team's star, Will Slason. He whipped the ball to the other end of the court. Jessica Adams slid on the floor to block the ball from going into the goal. It hit her in the chest with a thump.\n\n## Blinders Make It Fair\n\nAdams is the only player on the goalball team with full vision. Each team can have one player who is not blind. They wear dark glasses too.\n\n\"For sure, the first time you play it's scary,\" Adams said.\n\nPlayers wear pads to protect them from all the diving and sliding in the game. They don't wear face masks. They learn to guard their faces with their arms during games.\n\nIf they do not pay attention, they can get a bloody nose.\n\nPeople think blind people can be hurt easily, Kwong said. That \"isn't the case at all.\"\n\nThe team also has an adorable service dog, Van Dyke, who wears a team uniform. Goallball was invented after World War II for soldiers who were hurt in the war. The best goalball players throw the ball at up to 50 miles per hour.\n\n## Other Teams Needed\n\nBesides Berkeley, two other universities have started building their own goallball teams.\n\nMatt Grigorieff is a student at the university. He began the Athletics for All program. It gets people with disabilities into different kinds of sports.\n\nGrigorieff dreams that one day there will be a university league for sports like goalball. Athletes would include people with and without disabilities.\n\n\"We're showing that it can be done,\" he said.'"

He felt joy.\n\nHe couldn't see his mother in the crowd. He did not see that she and his teachers looked very happy.\n\nRichie is blind.\n\nRichie's mom is Ann Tienter. She said she sometimes forgets that her son is blind. The reason is he gets so much information from his other senses, she said.\n\n## Love Of Learning\n\nRichie's parents learned he was blind when he was 6 months old. His optic nerves are smaller than those of sighted people. The optic nerves are at the back of the eye. They send information from the eye to the brain.\n\nRichie loves learning, and reading. His favorites are books about European royalty and World War II.\n\nRitchie's mom began reading to Richie when he was a baby. She continued to read to him after they found out that he was blind. Except then the books changed. She started using books with raised bumps for the letters. They were written in Braille. Blind people read Braille with their fingers.\n\nNow Richie is 9. He goes to Westridge Elementary School near St. Louis. Teachers there say Richie reads like a high school student. He knows more words than his classmates, too.\n\nRichie doesn't think a lot about the challenges of being blind. At the spelling bee, he thought of his disability in a different way. It helped keep him from being nervous about seeing so many people in the audience, he said.\n\n## \"A Regular Kid\"\n\nJust before the holiday break, Westridge students took home sheets with spelling words to study. Richie's list was in Braille. He studied during the days off from school. However, Richie would only study during the week. He also would not study on holidays.\n\nRichie has been in other contests. Last summer, he won third place at the National Braille Challenge. Students from first grade through high school were there. They took part in contests in reading, spelling and other areas.\n\nRichie's parents expect no less of him than they would of a sighted child, his mom said. \"We wanted him to have a regular kid experience,\" she said.\n\nRichie uses Braille to read materials at school.\n\nRecently, Richie and his class were matching nouns with verbs. The other kids used papers and pencils. Richie read a Braille sheet with the words prepared ahead of time. He then typed out the answers using the six keys on a Braille notetaker.\n\nTo use the machine, Richie learned different codes for the letters of the alphabet. He also had to learn 180 contractions. Those are words that combine two other words, like \"don't\" from \"do not.\"\n\n## Next, A Bigger Contest\n\nRichie will now move on to a bigger contest. He will be in the written semi-finals of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Spelling Bee. He will go up against other school winners from across the St. Louis area.\n\nThen there is a spoken final contest. The winner there will represent the St. Louis area in the 2015 Scripps National Spelling Bee. A spokesman for Scripps said other kids who are blind have been in the national bee before. One was a girl from Oklahoma a few years ago. She made it to the third round.\n\nOfficials from the St. Louis regional spelling bee say children with disabilities can get some help. They are still figuring out what can be done for Richie on the written test. Someone might write his answers for him. He also might use his Braille machine to type them out.'"

The city is home to top universities and top sports teams.\n\n\"People already know where Boston is,\" said Pat Shaughnessy, who was waiting for a train.\n\nIn February, people in Boston were asked if they wanted the Olympics to happen there.

The decision about which city gets the Olympics is still two years away.\n\n## Mayor Says Olympics Would Be Great\n\nA U.S. city has not hosted the Summer Olympics since Atlanta in 1996. For each Olympics, a country chooses one of its cities. That city goes up against other cities from around the world. Each city wants to hold the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee then chooses one city. It will choose the next host in 2017. If people in Boston are still against the Olympics then, the IOC might not choose Boston.\n\nIn the past, voters in Denver, Munich, Germany, and Krakow, Poland, have said no to hosting the Olympics in their cities.

Brady will not be allowed to play the first four football games of next season. A report said he might have known about cheating.\n\n## Letting The Air Out\n\nOn Jan. 18, Brady's team, the New England Patriots, played against the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts told the NFL that something was not right about the footballs. The footballs were tested at halftime and were low on air.\n\nLetting the air out, or deflating, the balls makes them easier to throw and catch. Letting out too much air on purpose is cheating.\n\nThe Patriots won the game against the Colts, 45-7. Two weeks later, the Patriots won the Super Bowl, the championship game in football.\n\nLast week, the NFL found that the Patriots cheated. Brady probably knew that workers had let the air out, a report said.\n\n## Team Is Punished Too\n\nThe Patriots were fined $1 million. Also, the Patriots will not get their first-round draft choice next year or their fourth-round choice in 2017. NFL teams take turns choosing college players to play on their teams. This system is called the draft.\n\nThe two workers who let the air out of the balls were suspended. They cannot go back to work until the NFL says they can. One of the workers called himself \"the deflator\" in text messages.\n\nRoger Goodell is the NFL commissioner. He said it is important that football teams are honest.\n\n## Is The Penalty Fair?\n\nBrady's agent, Don Yee, said the NFL report was weak. He said Brady would try to get the suspension lifted so he could play.\n\nPatriots' owner Robert Kraft said the decision was not based on facts. He also said the punishment was too severe.\n\nKraft complained that he had evidence that cold weather caused the problem, but it was ignored. If you take a ball from a warm place to a cold place, it loses some of the air. The footballs were inflated in a warm room. Then they were used in the game, which was on a cold day, Kraft has argued.\n\nKraft said Brady has the team's complete support.\n\n## Former Players Argue\n\nThere have been mixed feelings about the punishments in the world of football.\n\nShawne Merriman is a former player. He approved that Brady was benched. \"It's a good thing the @nfl suspended Tom Brady now everyone knows that NOBODY is above the system,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer NFL tight end Jake Ballard thought differently. \"4 games?? What a joke!\" he wrote. He said what Brady did was not that serious.\n\nTroy Vincent is the NFL Executive Vice President. He said every player must follow the rules. When they break the rules, they should be punished like anyone else.\n\n## Some Fans Still Love Brady\n\nBrady is still as popular as ever among Patriots' fans. He was cheered last week, one day after the report came out. During an interview at Salem State University last Thursday, Brady was asked if the deflated footballs made the Super Bowl win matter less.\n\nBrady smiled. Then he answered, \"Absolutely not,\" to more cheers.\n\nRich Gannon is a former NFL quarterback and Most Valued Player.\n\n\"If you hate the Patriots you're going to say those guys always cheat,\" Gannon said. He said it does not matter how much air was in the footballs. \"What difference does it make?\" Gannon asked. \"He's still one of the greatest quarterbacks ever.\"\n\nThe point is that the rules were broken, and there is a price to pay, he said.'"

Janice Turner, a newspaper writer,  said the book was studied for the wrong reasons. She said it was studied because it is short, simple and has a preachy \"message\": bullying is bad.\n\nCarey, the professor, said he was sad these two American books were cut.\n\n\"It's true ...

His son did the same thing when he thrilled audiences worldwide.\n\nDel Castillo dropped out of high school at 17. He said training to be a bullfighter has given him more self-control. But he has made big sacrifices. His father refused to talk to him for six months. He works odd jobs to pay his rent.\n\n\"I think this is the lowest moment in the tradition,\" Cesar Rincon said. He is no longer a bullfighter. He's a bull rancher now. He lives in Madrid with his father. Rincon spends four months of the year in Colombia. Fewer places hold bullfights in Colombia these days. That has caused about a dozen bull ranches to go out of business in the last 10 years.\n\n## Half-Empty Arena\n\nTicket prices are too high for most Colombians. A low-paid worker would have to spend a whole month's pay to see a fight. Benjamin de Los Rios runs the Plaza de la Macarena in the city of Medellin. He says bullfighters that draw crowds to the plaza get paid up to $140,000 per afternoon. The result is a half-empty arena. It means fewer parents pass the tradition on to their children.\n\nAbout 30 college students protested before a recent bullfight at la Macarena. A man named Juan G led them. He did not want to give his full name. He was afraid of threats from bullfighting fans.\n\n\"We don't think that anyone has the right to torture anything, animals included,\" the New Jersey-born Colombian said. \"It's a shift in generations. The country is changing and we want to do away with violence.\"\n\nDe Los Rios blames Walt Disney. He and others say that cartoonists began to draw animals to look and act a bit like humans. Then people began to treat them as humans. In Colombia, schools teach students about animal abuse. Some teachers tell children that bullfighting is wrong.\n\nCesar Rincon says the beauty of bullfighting should be saved.\n\n\"We have to teach our roots, the backbone of our tradition,\" he said.\n\n## The End Of The Sport?\n\nIn recent years, people who are against bullfighting appeared to be winning.\n\nPlaza de Toros de Santamaria is a fancy bullfighting arena in Bogota. It has been closed for the past two years. The city's mayor has sided with animal rights supporters who are fighting to end the sport.\n\nBullfighters have had to get second jobs. Santiago Naranjo, a bullfighter since 2010, has a store at a Bogota shopping center. He also studies business.\n\nIn 2011 in Ecuador, voters in the country's capital decided to stop the killing of animals for sport in the city. Milton Calahorrano is president of Ecuador's bullfighting union. He said the bullfighting business was greatly harmed by the change. Still, the Plaza was at least three-quarters filled over the following two years.\n\nLast year, the group decided it would not hold bullfights in Quito until the law is changed and bulls can be killed. A bullring was set up outside the city limits. The group expects a change this year.'"

            "title": "California Chrome fans say bring on the big race at Belmont",
            "text": "\tBALTIMORE - California Chrome has won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. A horse needs to win those two races, plus the Belmont Stakes, to win horse racing's greatest honor, the Triple Crown.\n\nFor California Chrome, all that is left is Belmont. If he wins that race, he will become horse racing's 12th Triple Crown winner. Even more impressive, he will be the first horse to do it in 36 years.\n\nA horse named Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978. Since then, 12 horses have won the Derby and Preakness, but none of them won the Belmont. Only 11 horses won all three races. The Triple Crown has been around for 139 years.\n\nSome people in racing are not sure if a horse will win the Triple Crown again.\n\nIf California Chrome does not win the crown, \"I will never see it in my entire lifetime,\" said Steve Coburn. He is one of California Chrome's owners.\n\n## Waiting And Waiting ...\n\nThe 36 years since a Triple Crown winner is the longest wait ever. Before Secretariat won in 1973, the last horse to win the Triple Crown was in 1948. The wins were 25 years apart. California Chrome's owners and trainer hope their horse will break that streak.\n\nSpectacular Bid won the series' first two races in 1979. He lost at Belmont. With his loss, a string of near-misses began.\n\nCalifornia Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza has been in the running for the Triple Crown before. He rode War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 2002. He said he'll likely enjoy himself more this time around.\n\n## Bring On The Race\n\nThoroughbred racing is a big business. California Chrome's owners and trainers seem out of place compared with the other owners who have a lot more money. They have already experienced the pressure of being the Derby winner.\n\nBut all their attention will be on California Chrome.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be in anybody else's shoes right now,\" Sherman said. \"I think when we get to Belmont, this horse is going to run big.\"\n\nOther trainers with Triple Crown dreams likely have felt the same. But Steven Brandt said horses have changed since Affirmed won. Brandt owns Kid Cruz, who raced at the Preakness.\n\nThe races still matter, he said. But horses are not made to race as frequently as they were 15 or 20 years ago, he said. \"So I think it makes it tougher. If you can do it today, you really have an excellent horse - not to take away from other Triple Crown winners. But racing and medication and everything was different back then.\"\n\n## A Little Rest\n\nOwners and trainers prefer more rest for their horses between races. So horses who run at Churchill Downs and Pimlico also face tougher competition at the Belmont. Several Derby horses skip the Preakness. They wait for the Belmont to give them a better chance. Those horses have five weeks' rest between races.\n\nCoburn argued against that practice after the Preakness. \"There are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart.\"\n\nHe added, \"They don't want a Triple Crown winner. They want a paycheck.\"\n\nHe said only horses who ran the Kentucky Derby should be allowed in the Preakness and the Belmont. Horses should have to run the Preakness to be in the Belmont, he said.\n\nBob Baffert trained Bayern. He said Chrome is a \"cool customer.\"\n\n\"He does everything right,\" Baffert said.\n\nLinda Rice trains Kid Cruz. She also said California Chrome has a chance to win the Triple Crown. Not having one since Affirmed proves just how hard it is.\n\n\"I think, sooner or later, it'd be good if we had one,\" Rice said. \"We're due.\"'"

            "text": "\tA player was recently accused of cheating at an important chess tournament in Italy. He was kicked out.\n\nHis eyes gave him away.\n\nThe 37-year-old player was \"batting his eyelids in the most unnatural way,\" referee Jean Coqueraut said. Coqueraut said he figured out that Arcangelo Ricciardi was blinking in a special code.\n\nThere were other reasons to be suspicious of Ricciardi. He kept his thumb tucked into his armpit. He refused to get up from his seat even after playing for hours. He also was quickly beating players ranked much higher than him.\n\n## Tiny Video Camera For Good Luck?\n\nRicciardi was sent through a metal detector. It showed that he was wearing a necklace beneath his shirt. It contained a tiny video camera. The camera was connected to a small box underneath his armpit.\n\nIt is believed Ricciardi was using the video camera to send his games to a helper or a computer program. The helper or computer then sent signals for suggested moves to the armpit box. Ricciardi said that the necklace and box were just good-luck charms. Yoga and training had helped him to play better, he said.\n\nCoqueraut said that he thinks Ricciardi was testing the cheating system for another player. The tournament's prize is only about $1,100. The prize amount is not enough to risk a career, he said.\n\n## More Ways To Cheat Than We Can Count\n\nThe Guardian newspaper's Stephen Moss has written often about chess. He said there seems to be more and more cheating. Computers can beat even the best players. There are a million ways a cheater can use a computer.\n\nOne example came in April. The 25-year-old Georgian chess champion Gaioz Nigalidze was disqualified from the Dubai Open tournament. Officials had found an iPhone hidden in a bathroom stall. It had an open computer chess program on it. Nigalidze went to the bathroom after every move. It made his opponent suspicious.\n\nClaude Shannon is a math expert. He said the number of possible ways for a chess game to play out is enormous. There are more possible mixes of moves in any chess game than there are stars that can be seen in the universe.\n\nEven super-fast computers are outmatched. It would take a standard machine longer than the age of the universe just to look at all the possible things that could happen from its first move, Shannon said. The universe is billions of years old.\n\n## \"Easy To Cheat With A Phone\"\n\nYet computers do have a better shot at winning than humans. In 1997, an IBM supercomputer named Deep Blue beat a world champion. Since then, computers have only gotten smarter. An iPhone can now do what Deep Blue did.\n\nExperts believe the current best chess computer programs would be rated between 3200 and 3300 on the scale used to measure chess players. Magnus Carlsen is the world's top living chess player. He is rated 2862.\n\n\"It's incredibly easy to cheat with a phone,\"said English chess grandmaster Nigel Short. He once was ranked third in the world. \"My dog could win a major tournament using one of these devices. Or my grandmother. Anybody could do this.\"\n\nChess fans worry that nobody will bother to play if anyone with a phone can win. They believe the best way to keep the game competitive is to not allow iPhones and hidden cameras.\n\nTony Rich is a top U.S. chess official. He said it is hard to stop cheaters.\n\nYou cannot ask players to take their shoes off and be searched before every game, he said. \"I doubt you'll find many people who'd want to come out to the chess tournament,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - It was Xu Dou's first day of teaching Chinese in a Florida middle school. He showed his students old Chinese characters. He wanted them to see how the writing has changed over the years.\n\n\"Most of the students love the language. They think the language is amazing,\" Xu said.\n\n\"I tell them, if you want to learn real Chinese, you have to learn how to write Chinese characters,\" he added.\n\nThat will take a lot of memorization and practice. But Xu's students already have a good start. Many began learning Chinese two years earlier at their elementary school. Li Meng, another newly arrived teacher, is working there this year.\n\n## An Important Language To Learn\n\nXu and Li are two of 129 teachers from China. They are part of the largest Chinese guest-teacher program. It is supported by the College Board and the Confucius Institute, or Hanban. It promotes the study of Chinese language and culture.\n\nThe Chinese guest-teacher program started in 2007. Today it is in 30 states. The largest numbers of teachers are in Utah, North Carolina and Ohio. These are places with statewide Chinese programs.\n\nChinese is an important language for Americans to learn. But the government has stopped giving money to teach languages in school before college.\n\nLast year, Congress stopped offering money for foreign language learning. Schools had used the money to pay for foreign language classes.\n\nOne-quarter of elementary schools had language classes in 2008. In 1997, it was one- third.\n\n## Chinese Characters And Tai Chi\n\nXu and Li are fluent English speakers. They learned it in China. All students there learn English beginning in elementary school. This is their first trip to the United States.\n\nXu grew up, went to a university and teaches high school English in north-central China. He will return there after the school year. He will rejoin his wife and 7-month-old son.\n\nLi teaches 570 students, kindergarteners to fifth-graders. Students see her once a week for class. The older students have a Chinese club. They learn tai chi with her on Fridays.\n\nLi, 31, has been teaching high school English for seven years in eastern China. She said she already liked Florida because it reminded her of Qingdao, her hometown. \"I love sunshine, the beach and the sea,\" she said.\n\nFarther north, the University of North Carolina has been a fan of the guest-teacher program for four years. China is North Carolina's No. 2 trading partner. Companies in the state are selling more things to China.\n\n## More Students Taking Chinese Classes\n\nThe Chinese government pays $13,000 of each teacher's salary, said Matt Friedrick. He runs a kindergarten-to-high-school education program that is based out of the university. The government also covers their travel.\n\nDesa Dawson is the president of a national council of state language program heads. The council helped choose the guest teachers.\n\nSchool districts are giving up language programs. They cannot find enough teachers, Dawson said.\n\nLearning a language gives students many skills they will need in life. It helps students understand others and share ideas. Learning a language also makes people comfortable in new situations. It gives a better understanding of other cultures.\n\nThe College Board runs the SAT and AP tests. It helped start the Chinese guest-teacher program in 2007. That same year, it began its AP program in Chinese language and culture. The AP program is like a college-level class. The guest-teacher program helps prepare students who want to take the AP course.\n\nThree thousand students took the AP Chinese test in 2007. In 2012, that number had grown to more than 9,000.'"

She hoped high school coaches and even college coaches would notice her.\n\nBut then her coach did not give her playing time. The coach said she could switch teams. That is what she decided to do. Then the league told her she could not join another team.\n\nSo Audrey and her family went to court to complain that the club team was being unfair. In a court, the judge gets to decide who wins the argument.\n\n## Teams Can Cost A Lot Of Money\n\nAudrey said she could miss an important volleyball season this spring. The league said Audrey is just upset about not getting playing time.\n\nSome parents get upset when their children are cut, benched, yelled at by coaches or even fouled too hard. Lately, many of these parents have been turning to courts for help.\n\nSports teams are getting more competitive. Parents are giving up entire weekends to bring kids to games.\n\nParents are also spending thousands of dollars to be on travel teams and play in competitive high school programs. Club teams are expensive. The average travel team parent is spending about $2,300 a year. Parents of the top players might spend $20,000 a year or more.\n\nAudrey's mother said the family will spend about $6,000 on her daughter's volleyball this year.\n\nParents want proof that the money they are spending is paying off. Some are willing to go to courts for help if they do not get this proof.\n\n## She Just Wants To Play\n\nAudrey said she is not sure if she will play volleyball in college. But her family believes the spring season of 10th grade is an important one. It is a chance to work with coaches who can help her get better.\n\nAudrey cannot understand why she is not allowed to join another team.\n\nThe problem began after Audrey and about 75 other girls competed for spots on the same team. The coach told Audrey she was the best at her position of setter. She was told she would get playing time.\n\nWhen the season began, Audrey got practice play with her team. But she was on the bench for the first two games.\n\nThe coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team. The coach also said she would not play much for the rest of the season.\n\nThe family was disappointed and confused. They paid a lot of money. Now they felt they had not been given what they were promised.\n\n## Taking The Fun Out Of Playing\n\nThe coach gave Audrey two choices: She could be a practice player for the team or transfer to a new team in the league. She decided to transfer. Her parents found a team willing to take her.\n\nThe league has to OK changes like this. It would not agree to Audrey's request. It said allowing Audrey to make the switch would set a bad example. It said players can switch teams only if they can prove that they have a really difficult problem.\n\nThey are not the only parents complaining. A recent study showed that many parents thought youth sports were too expensive and took up too much time. They also said winning was becoming too important, instead of just having fun.\n\nAudrey will not play this season. But her mother said the fight will continue. She thinks it is the right thing to do.\""
