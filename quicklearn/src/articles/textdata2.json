It used to be much harder.\n\nFour hundred years ago, people also made pictures of themselves. These selfies were called self-portraits. The artists used paint and brushes. They thought long and hard about every detail.\n\nA museum will show these paintings. The museum is called the Mauritshaus. It is in the Netherlands, a country in Europe. People in the Netherlands are called the Dutch.\n\n## Special Paintings To Hang\n\nArtists made the paintings a long time ago. The Netherlands was very rich 400 years ago. That time is called the Dutch Golden Age. Many beautiful paintings were made.\n\nEmilie Gordenker is in charge of the museum. She said this is the first time a museum has shown self-portraits and selfies.\n\nYes, you can take selfies in the museum.\n\n## Rembrandt Loved Selfies\n\nThe show started October 8. It ends January 3. It includes 27 self-portraits. Some of the artists are famous, like Rembrandt van Rijn. He painted dozens of pictures of himself.\n\nOther artists are not so famous. One of them is Huygh Pietersz Voskuyl. His picture is on the poster for the show. He painted it in 1638. He is staring over his right shoulder. It almost looks like a selfie. Golden Age artists looked into mirrors to paint themselves. In the show, giant mirrors are all over. They reflect the paintings.\n\nA video was made. It shows how today's selfie takers can make their pictures better. They can learn from the Dutch artists.\n\n## Look At All The Details\n\nHuygh's painting looks simple. It shows how painters paid attention to all the details.\n\nHe carefully painted his beard and his shirt. Huygh even painted the wooden wall behind him. Emilie said he thought a lot about these things. They show what kind of person Huygh was.\n\nSelf-portraits were not just pictures of the artist. The artists wanted to sell their paintings. The pictures showed people their beautiful art, said Ariana van Suchtelen. She is in charge of the show.\""

But he doesn't play an instrument. He plays the fence that separates the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nFor eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence. He doesn't make songs exactly. Instead, he makes haunting sounds.\n\nWeyant's music is low-tech. He turns a tin can into a microphone. He presses it against the fence. The can is attached to wires. Then he uses electricity to make the sound louder.\n\nHe records the noise from birds landing on top of the fence. Or, the sounds of cars passing through the border checkpoint.\n\n## Music On YouTube\n\nHis songs can last a minute. Or, they can be more than half an hour.\n\nHe doesn't have an audience. There's just grass, trees and rocks near him. But, videos of his music are on YouTube.\n\n\"Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people,\" he said.\n\nHe hopes his music will get people on both sides of the border to talk more. He thinks people fear the fence. It was built to keep people from coming into the U.S. Some people try to enter even if they aren't allowed to. Often, they are looking for better jobs.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks the fence was built up even more. Now it's made of solid steel in some places.\n\n## Along The Fence\n\nIt's not against the law to touch it. Though, people usually stay away from the fence.\n\nFor the most part, border police have left him alone. Some police are curious about him.\n\n\"Why are you playing a wall?\" one asked.\n\nAnother radioed his boss: \"There's a guy playing the wall. Is he allowed to do that?\"\n\nPolice have warned him about people on the Mexican side of the fence. But, he's never had any run-ins with people on either side of the fence.\n\nWeyant said the border wall is the right place to make music. It's haunted with stories.\n\n\"This section is where hundreds of people die,\" he said. The people die of starvation or because they have no water.\n\nDusty handprints could be seen on the fence near Sasabe. \"Was it just a kid who jumped the fence? So many stories,\" Weyant said.'"

If you answered New York City, you are right too.\n\n\"Winnie-the-Pooh\" is a book by A.A. Milne. It was written in 1926. In the stories, Pooh lives in a forest with his friends. Sometimes they are visited by their friend Christopher Robin.\n\nChristopher Robin was a real boy. He grew up in England. He was A.A. Milne's son. Pooh and the others were real, too. They were the real Christopher Robin's stuffed animals.\n\nThose stuffed animals are very old now. They are almost 100 years old. You can still see them. They live at the New York Public Library.\n\n## Pooh Could Have Two Homes\n\nPooh's story is a long one.\n\nA.A. Milne bought the bear for his son Christopher Robin in 1921. He wrote stories about Pooh and his friends. Winnie-the-Pooh became famous.\n\nHis son kept Pooh until 1947. Christopher Robin said he was too old for stuffed animals. He gave the bear to a friend in the United States. Pooh changed owners a few times. He finally ended up at the library in New York in 1987. He has been there ever since. He and his friends are in a special Children's Corner.\n\nSome people think this is unfair. They think that Pooh should return to England. After all, that is where Pooh is from.\n\nSome people even want to build a Winnie-the-Pooh museum. Pooh and the other animals could live there. It would be near the forest where the real-life Christopher Robin used to play with the stuffed animals.\n\nNot everyone thinks this is a good idea. Some people think Pooh should stay in New York.\n\n## Lots Of People Care About Pooh\n\nWhy are grown-ups arguing about a stuffed animal?\n\nWell, grown-ups used to be kids, too. Many of them grew up with Pooh and love him. Maybe that is why they care about where the stuffed bear should be.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Pooh stay in New York or go back to England?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot just ask Pooh where he wants to live. Unlike the Winnie-the-Pooh from the stories, this Pooh does not talk.'"

It was full of gold and jewels.\n\nExperts think the tomb has hidden rooms. A beautiful queen may be buried in one of them.\n\nMamdouh el-Damaty is an Egyptian official. He is in charge of Egypt's ancient places. Egypt is in the Middle East.\n\nMamdouh wants to look for the rooms. They are in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Many ancient Egyptian kings were buried there. King Tut was also buried there.\n\n## Tomb Was Built For A Queen, Expert Says\n\nNicholas Reeves is an expert on ancient Egypt. He visited Tut's tomb with Mamdouh. Nicholas thinks ancient Egyptians built it for Queen Nefertiti. He says Tut buried her. Tut died 10 years after Nefertiti. Then, Nicholas thinks Tut was buried near Nefertiti.\n\nNicholas said the walls may hide two doorways. One of them may lead to Nefertiti's tomb. The tomb looks like it was built for a queen. It does not look like it was built for a king.\n\n## Official Says Maybe Tut's Mother Is In Tomb\n\nMamdouh agrees that a woman might be buried in the tomb. He thinks it is Kia, though. Some experts think Kia was Tut's mother.\n\nNefertiti was married to Pharaoh Akhenaten. Pharaoh is the ancient Egyptian word for king. Smenkhare became pharaoh after Akhenaten died. Tut came after.\n\nNicholas thinks Smenkhare was really Nefertiti. He says Nefertiti changed her name to Smenkhare. Then she became king.\n\nExperts hope to find the secret rooms. Then they may find out the real story. King Tut's family is full of secrets.\""

They are so small we cannot see them.\n\n## Cancer Starts When Cells Are Hurt\n\nCancer starts when cells are hurt. The hurt cells grow out of control. Then they spread. If they keep spreading through the body, it can kill a person.\n\nElephants have many more cells than people do. After all, they are much bigger than us. Yet they do not get cancer very often.\n\nUntil now no one knew why.\n\n## Elephants Have More Anti-Cancer Genes\n\nScientists think they have found the answer. It has to do with a gene called p53. Genes are inside of cells. They tell cells what to do.\n\nThere are many different kinds of genes. They do many different things. Scientists believe the p53 gene helps to fight cancer.\n\nPeople have one p53 gene in each cell. Scientists wanted to see how many elephants have. They looked at other animals too.\n\nIt turns out elephants have many more p53 genes than people. They have more than all other animals.\n\nScientists say each elephant cell has 20 of the genes. They keep elephants safe from cancer.\n\n## New Knowledge Could Keep Cancer From Growing\n\nThe scientists looked at more than 60 kinds of animals. Only elephants have so many p53 genes. The rest have only one in each cell. They have the same number as people.\n\nWhat scientists learned might help fight cancer. They might find a way to give people more p53 genes. The added genes could keep cancer from growing.\n\nElephants might have shown us something very important. They might help us stop cancer.'"

He needs help from a saxophone player. The saxophonist is practicing nearby. The saxophonist tells the student he will be right over.\n\nMichael Lang started the school with Paul. Michael organized the Woodstock music festival. The famous festival took place in a muddy field. It is about an hour away from where the new school will be.\n\n## Dreaming About What This School Will Be\n\nNot long ago Paul and Michael walked through the school. Its classrooms are empty now. Soon they will be filled with students making music The gym will be a recording studio. Huge bands will fit inside.\n\nStudents will go to the school for two years. They will learn to make and sell music. Michael wants to teach students everything there is to know about the music business.\n\nStudents who are between 18 and 22 years old can go to this school. Adults can go, too. Each student will learn how to play two instruments. Students can pick out one instrument. Teachers will pick the other.\n\n## Famous Musicians Will Teach Classes\n\nGuest teachers will be popular. Some are famous musicians.\n\nStudents will often see Paul. He now runs a different school of rock. He gives younger students lessons after school. He acts silly. He sticks his head in classrooms and sings loudly.'"

It is also kind of beautiful, she thinks. \n\nThe Gum Wall started 20 years ago. It is near a theater. People were waiting in long lines outside. They wanted to get into the theater to see a show. They were bored. People stuck their used gum to the wall outside the theater.\n\nFor years, the wads only covered a small part of one wall. Then people took pictures in front of the wall. They posted them to Instagram and Facebook. More people came. The gum wall grew.\n\n## A City That Believes In Bubble Gum\n\nAllison Hazen and Philip Prahst visited the Gum Wall on their wedding day. They wanted to celebrate by sticking gum on the wall.\n\nIt was perfect. Only they forgot to bring gum.\n\nPeople saw Allison's white wedding dress. They clapped. One lady even filled Allison's hands with white gum.\n\nIt took workers 130 hours to clean the Gum Wall. Right after they finished, people started adding more gum to the wall. Soon the Gum Wall could be back.\""

There are many tests from the start.\n\nIn one test, soldiers have to march on foot for 12 miles. Even though it is very hard, Shaye and Kristen did it.

At night, the frame makes the dome glow.\n\nThe workers are fixing the dome a little at a time. Much of the work has been done on nights and weekends. That is because lawmakers still want to be able to use the building. They need to get to their meetings. They want people to visit too.\n\n## On Time And On Budget\n\nZoe Lofgren is a lawmaker from California. She said they cannot let the dome fall apart.\n\nZoe said the project will be finished next year. Workers have already taken down part of the frame. Fixing the dome will cost almost $60 million.\n\nIn 2013, workers fixed the Washington Monument. An earthquake had damaged it. The monument honors George Washington. He was the country's first president. Workers wrapped the monument in a metal frame. It looked like a glowing rocket ship at night.\n\nZoe thinks the same thing about the Capitol frame. She said it also looks like a spaceship.\n\nThe building is more beautiful, though, than the metal frame, she said.\""

Ten people were killed.\n\nThe small city of Illapel was hurt the most. It is near where the earthquake hit hardest. On Thursday, people there had to sleep outside.\n\n## Strong Earthquake, Big Waves\n\nEarthquakes have different strengths. The strengths are called magnitudes. An earthquake with a magnitude of 2 is not much. It would hardly be felt. Anything above 8 is very bad.\n\nWednesday's earthquake had a magnitude above 8.\n\nEarthquakes that strong can make the sea move. The moving water makes big waves.\n\nSuch waves are called tsunamis. They can wash over houses near the sea. People can drown if they are caught in a tsunami.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chile's leaders said the country could be hit by tsunamis. Many people quickly moved inland or away from the sea. Others went to higher ground.\n\n## Felt Like \"The End Of The World\"\n\nSome towns were hit by tsunamis. They caused flooding. Luckily, the waves were smaller than some people feared.\n\nThe earthquake was very strong. It could even be felt in nearby countries. People in Argentina felt it.\n\n\"I thought it was the end of the world,\" said Manuel Moya. He lives in Illapel. The earthquake knocked down his home.\n\nMoya said he and his wife were in bed when the earthquake hit. The two quickly ran outside. Minutes later their home fell down.\n\n## Chile Has Had Many Earthquakes\n\n\"They said it was a magnitude 8 but it felt like a 10,\" Moya said.\n\nChile has had many earthquakes before. The world's biggest earthquake happened there in 1960. More than 5,000 people were killed.\n\nAnother earthquake hit Chile in 2010. It killed 500 people.\n\nAfter that, Chile's leaders started working very hard. They wanted to be ready for any other earthquakes. They figured out the best ways for people to stay safe.\n\nTheir hard work helped greatly on Wednesday. Many more people could have been killed.'"

The chimp climbed to the top. Then he got six friends to join him. They all climbed up the branch.\n\nAt one point, three chimps went over the wall. Only zoo workers can enter that area though.\n\nNone of the zoo visitors were ever in danger.\n\nThe breakout happened in the afternoon. It took an hour to get the animals back in. Twelve chimps live in a huge fenced-in area. It's the size of 75 football fields.\n\nZoo workers lured the chimps back with fruit and vegetables.\n\n\"It was almost their dinnertime,\" Wisthoff said.\n\nMost of the chimps went back quietly. One chimp liked his freedom. Zookeepers offered him malted milk balls.\n\nThat worked, said Wisthoff.\n\n## \"Code Red\"\n\nChimps can be dangerous. The largest chimp weighed about 150 pounds. They also can be very strong.\n\nThe escape caused a \"Code Red.\" That's the zoo's emergency plan. Visitors had to stay where they were. About 1,800 people visited the zoo Thursday.\n\nZoo visitor Mari Cintron was at the penguin exhibit when the chimps escaped. She was with three children. They all enjoyed their time.\n\n\"We just visited with the penguins,\" she said. \"It was very calm.\"\n\nBut Brie Huffman was stuck in an area where food is kept. It was boring and smelly. Zoo workers gave her free tickets. That made her happy.\n\nThe free tickets are good until Dec. 31. Huffman said she will be using all of them.'"

Farmers are excited about using the drones.\n\n## Safety Is Important\n\nThe new plan says farmers can fly small drones. They must weigh less than 55 pounds. That is about as much as a medium-sized dog.\n\nFarmers must learn how to fly drones safely. They will need to pass a test. Drones should only be used in the daylight.\n\nSome people are worried. They say the new plan is not safe enough.\n\n## Sharing The Sky\n\nDrones and planes have to share the sky. Pilots say drones are too hard to see. They do not want to crash into them.\n\nPilots want to add new rules to the plan. They want drone makers to put lights on their drones. Lights would make drones easier to see.

Driving costs more because it requires fixing roads. Biking will save cities more money.\n\nStefan's study only looked at Copenhagen. He thinks the results can help many other cities.

It is the group's highest honor.\n\n## More Than A Place To Play\n\nClaire loves basketball. She knows a basketball court is not always about basketball. It is about sharing and becoming a family.\n\nLast spring, she met with officials from Door of Hope. The group owns the apartments for homeless families. She asked them what kind of project they needed. They gave her ideas like building bookcases or planting bushes. Then one of the workers had a crazy idea. She could turn one of the building's yards into a basketball court.\n\nTim Peters is the head of Door of Hope. He said that the children really needed a safe place to play.\n\nAt first, Claire did not think it would be that hard. It turned out to be more work than she thought.\n\n## From Raising Money To Pulling Weeds\n\nThe court took nearly three weeks to build. It cost about $25,000\\\\. Claire raised the money and found someone to build it. She showed up every day after school. She checked on everything. At first, she was scared to phone strangers. By the end, she told workers where to pour the concrete.\n\nFinally, on Dec. 22, it was finished. About 12 kids ran to play on their new court. Watching them was the best part, Claire said.\n\nOn Thursday, a woman named Susana looked at her son playing on the court. Her son is named Jonathan. He is 11 years old.\n\nSusana said she sees a change in him. There is a smile on his face. He can go out and play and just be a kid. She said, \"Who knew a court could be so important?\"'"

They have trouble finding enough money to pay for a home. They hold cardboard signs asking for money.\n\nMany of these signs look messy. A student in Chicago saw these signs. He decided he could help make them beautiful. His name is Ian Todd. He is an artist. He replaced the messy signs with beautiful ones he made. He hopes the beautiful signs will stand out. If more people notice the signs, they will notice the people holding them.\n\n## Get People Talking\n\nIan wants to get people talking about the homeless. He does not want them to get passed by. Some people think the signs work. Other people are not sure they work. There are still many things that need to be done to help homeless people in Chicago.\n\nIan first talked to homeless people to see if they wanted new signs. Some did not want his help, but others did. He started working on the new signs right away. He finished about 20 signs in two months. He said it can take up to 10 hours to make one sign.\n\n## New Signs Work For Some\n\nMike Droney is 54 years old and homeless. He was a soldier in the army. He lost his leg while fighting.\n\nIan made him a sign. It says, \"I lost my leg for my country. Please help.\"\n\nMike said many people like his sign. Still, he is not sure the sign helps.

Still, the homeless need more help than just the signs. Ed thinks that the city of Chicago needs better laws. Right now, there are too many homeless people. At night, there are not enough places for them to sleep. There needs to be more places built, Ed said.\n\nIan has now moved to Los Angeles. There are homeless people there, too.

Others look for work. \n\nMany students do not graduate. They never finish high school. They drop out. \n\nIt can be hard for those students to find work.\n\nThe U.S. government keeps track of graduation. It looks at how many students graduate from high school. \n\n## More Students Graduating\n\nThe government put out a new report recently.\n\nThe report looks at the 2013-2014 school year. It says how many students finished high school.\n\nThe report gives an important number. The number is called the graduation rate. It says how many students out of every 100 graduated. People want the graduation rate to go up.\n\nThe graduation rate did go up a bit. Eighty-two out of every 100 students finished high school. Only 81 out of every 100 students graduated the year before. \n\n## Rates For Black, Hispanic Students Rise\n\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students changed the most. Their graduation rates went up more than rates for white students. \n\nGraduation rates are different in different parts of the country. \n\nIowa did the best of all the states. Around 91 out of every 100 high school students graduated. Washington, D.C., had the lowest rate. Only 61 out of every 100 students graduated.\n\nNebraska, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Texas, New Hampshire and Indiana did well. All were in the high 80s. Nevada and New Mexico did poorly.

They want to see 90 out of every 100 students graduating. They want to reach that goal by 2020. \n\nIt is not enough to go from 81 out of every 100 students graduating to 82, these people say. The change is not big enough. The U.S. must do better.\n\nStill, African-American and Hispanic students are graduating more than before. The country's graduation rate has gone up. That is good.\""

It said it was a Hindu god. The stone said it wanted to stay in town. The next day, farmers carried the stone away from the river.\n\n## A Special Place For Shani\n\nVillagers tried to protect the stone by building around it. This did not work. The building fell down. Some of the workers got hurt. The people decided that Shani should be out in the open. Then the villagers made their own houses more open. They took off the doors.\n\nMany people still believe in the story of Shani. Others are not so sure. They say people do steal in the town. But most do not talk about it.\n\nNow the town has a police station. It has doors, but there are no locks.'"

Next, they picked mushrooms in the forest. Then they exercised in the gym.\n\nChiharu Yamaguchi is the mother of the only two girls in the school. She moved to Aone nine years ago.

Older kids can get hurt by them also.\n\nChristin Rivas found this out the hard way.\n\nThe 14-year-old was playing with magnets at school. She needed both hands to grab something. So she put the magnets in her mouth. Someone made her laugh. And gulp, she swallowed them.\n\nFive days later, Christin was in the hospital. Doctors took the magnets out. Along with the magnets, doctors removed part of her colon. The colon is beneath the stomach. It's part of the body's system to break down food.\n\n## Playing With Magnets\n\nMany magnet toys include warnings. They tell people not to put magnets in their mouths or noses. But that has not stopped a growing number of kids from doing that.\n\n\"Kids swallow a lot of objects,\" said Dr. Tejas Mehta. He is a doctor at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. Dr. Mehta cared for Rivas. \"Magnets cause more damage than anything else.\"\n\nMagnet injuries have became much more common. Between 2002 and 2011, a doctor said, 22,500 kids had to go to the hospital. Usually the kids swallowed the magnets. But a quarter of the kids put the magnets up their nose, said Julie Brown. She is a doctor in Seattle.\n\nThe magnet problem is getting worse, she said.\n\n\"There is something very tempting about\" magnets, Brown said.\n\nTo toddlers, magnets can look like sprinkles. Older kids also like magnets. They use them to pretend they have a pierced tongue or nose.\n\n## Taken To The Hospital\n\nSome doctors don't know magnets can be a serious problem. When Christin swallowed the magnets, her mom took her to the hospital. A doctor said the magnets would leave her body when she pooped. He sent them home.\n\nThis didn't sound right to her mom. She read about magnet injuries on the Internet. Then she got scared.\n\nShe took Christin to another hospital. There, doctors tracked the magnets with an X-ray machine.\n\nThe magnets looked stuck. So, the doctors decided to operate.\n\nThe doctors safely removed them. But the operation can cause health problems later on.\n\n\"Don't even think about touching them or buying\" magnets, Christin said. \"I messed up my intestines. I worry about that down the road.\"'"

His name is Todd Irving. He wants to get the school back under control.\n\n## Understanding Their Problems\n\nIrving has a plan. First, students must follow small rules, like getting to class on time. Second, he will give troublemakers attention.\n\nIrving asked the school to put together a list of the 50 most troubled students. He promised to be responsible for them.\n\nHe met with each of the students and their parents. The meetings helped Irving understand their problems at home. These aren't bad kids, he realized. They are kids who have had hard lives.\n\nSome of the students don't have beds to sleep in. Some of the boys have fathers in jail. Others have mothers who were sent home to another country. There are also students who are addicted to drugs.\n\nIrving set goals for all 50 students. Each signed a piece of paper called a contract. It says they must come to class every day. And they must follow the rules.\n\n## Dealing With A Troublemaker\n\nOn the second morning of school, Irving explained the rules. Students must pick up their own garbage. They must get to class on time. They must not fight or threaten to hurt anyone.\n\nThat afternoon, a father told Irving that another kid was bullying his son. The father was so angry he was almost crying.\n\nThe troublemaker was an eighth-grader with braces in his mouth and spiked hair. His name was Ernesto. Irving called Ernesto into his office. His mother and a police officer came also.\n\nThe officer told Ernesto that Spurgeon has become a new school.\n\n\"Who's the man in charge?\" asked the officer.\n\n\"Him,\" Ernesto said quietly, looking at Irving.\n\nIrving asked Ernesto to sign the contract.\n\n## Kids Are Behaving Better\n\nDuring the day, students are in and out of Irving's office. Sometimes Irving pulls troublemakers out of class. Irving lets them sit in his office. They can do homework or just talk.\n\nSo far, his plan is working. Many of the kids on his list are behaving much better.\n\nBut Irving knows that students behave best at the beginning of the year. As the year goes on, they can get out of control.\n\nSo Irving is trying not to get comfortable. He knows the kids could get worse if they aren't made to follow the rules.'"

It helps get them ready for battle.\n\n## School Was Tough But She Was Tougher\n\nLisa is not a quitter, but one day she almost gave up. Kristen and Shaye moved ahead to the next training. Lisa thought she would move on, too. She had to stay back though. She needed to learn important things before she could go on. She started to cry. She wanted to go home.\n\nThen Lisa pulled out a photo. It was of her children, Zac and Victoria. They were dressed as superheroes. Lisa had come to Ranger School to be their hero. She could not let her kids down.\n\n## Proving That Women Are As Strong As Men\n\nLisa wanted to show that women are as strong as men.\n\nLisa's hard work paid off. She finally finished the course. The Army announced Ranger School would now be open to both men and women. The next course starts in November. The Army expects female soldiers to sign up.\n\nLisa thought she might be treated differently. It did not matter that Lisa is a female. Her teachers only wanted to know if she was tough enough to carry out a mission.\""

They fell in love and got married.\n\nGonpo and her husband moved to a new town in China. Life was quiet. Gonpo went to college. She was a teacher. They had two daughters. The people in the town did not know Gonpo was a princess.\n\nOne day, the Chinese government learned the truth. Gonpo's family was moved to a new apartment. The government gave her special things.\n\n## Her Heart Was In Tibet\n\nGonpo was not unhappy in China. In her heart though, she felt like she was forgetting about Tibet. She was allowed to visit her old village just one time. Gonpo cried. She decided to visit India.\n\nGonpo went to India in 1989. She planned to stay for just a few months. She brought one daughter with her. Gonpo took Tibetan language lessons. She also met the Dalai Lama. He is the leader of the TIbetans.\n\nOnce she settled there, Gonpo did not return to China. She was the only living child of the Mei king. Gonpo felt like she had to stay. She did not see her husband or younger daughter for many years.\n\nGonpo knew it made her husband sad. However, he knew that for Gonpo, Tibet was more important than family.'"

Some people do not want any gun laws. Right now, I can imagine them arguing. We need more guns and fewer gun safety laws, they will say.\n\nDoes anybody really believe this? Many people who own guns in this country are responsible. They know that it's not true. Most Americans understand we should be changing these laws. Even law-following gun owners believe we should change these laws.\n\nThere is a gun for almost everyone in America. How can you make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws usually have the fewest gun deaths. People who do not want gun laws say that they will lead to more criminals having guns. They say people who follow the law will not be able to get guns. This is just not true.\n\n## America Must Change Laws To Stop More Deaths\n\nBy not calling for stricter gun laws, we are letting this gun violence happen. All of us must answer to those families who lost their loved ones. We did not do anything to stop this. We do all sorts of things to help make communities safer. Gun violence should not be different. We must pass laws.\n\nTonight, those of us who are lucky enough to hug our children are thinking about the families who are not so fortunate. While we do this I ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws. If you think this is a problem, then you should expect the lawmakers you vote for to do something about it.\n\n## Gun Owners: Are Your Views Being Heard?\n\nI would especially ask America's gun owners to think about this problem. Think about whether your views are being heard.\n\nEach time this happens I'm going to bring this up. Each time this happens I am going to say that we can do something about it. We are going to have to change our laws. This is not something I can do alone.\n\nI hope and pray that I do not have to give another speech like this. I do not want to talk to the nation about another shooting. After seeing many shootings as president, I cannot promise that. This is terrible to say. Still, it can change.\""

MegaBots asked the builders of the Japanese robot to fight. They said yes. Now both sides have to pick a time and place.\n\n## Faster, Stronger Robot\n\nMegaBots wants to make robot fighting a sport. Some gamers have been waiting for this, Gui said. People like fights and people like technology. \"This is a perfect blend,\" he said. Gamers will be happy.\n\nThe Japanese robot is named Kuratas. It is faster and stronger than Mk II. Kuratas has a machine gun. Mk II only fires paintballs. It also needs a driver to keep moving. Mk II is more like a truck than a robot. That will change.\n\nKuratas can fight with its hands. Mk II uses its guns. It cannot hit or take a punch, Matt said.\n\nThe builders knew Mk II needed to be changed. Matt and Gui looked for help online. They asked for money to make their robot better.\n\n## More Robot Army Power\n\nThey spent almost four months working on Mk II. Now It can take a punch. Mk II also moves better. It will need more power to run some of the things that were added.\n\nThe inventors want to start a new sport. It would be a kind of robot Olympics. There will be special arenas. Each country will have a robot army.\n\nNo one should worry, Matt and Gui say. It will just be for sport.\n\nThe Mk II is big and slow, Gui says. It can fall over. He says it is not really useful for a real army.\n\nIn a robot fight, it is different. Look out, Kuratas.'"

She did not like the results of the election. The school has many Hispanic and African-American students. The principal said not enough of them were elected.\n\n## Talk First, Results Later\n\nLena did not say who won right away. First, she wanted students to talk.

She wanted students to talk about how to make sure all groups were part of the student council.\n\nThen she told everyone who won.\n\n## Calling All Students\n\nThere are about 500 students at the school. They are in sixth, seventh and eighth grades. More than half are Hispanic or Latino. About one of every 10 is African-American.\n\nThe school is in the Mission District. More people are moving into the neighborhood. The people work for technology companies. They make a lot of money. They can pay more money for homes. Rents are going up. It is becoming more expensive to live there. Some people are leaving.\n\nLena said some groups were not on the council. This could be a problem. She wants to hear their thoughts at council meetings. Lena wants to know what students think about the school, she said.\n\n## What Parents Think\n\nSome parents were not happy. One was Todd David. His son is in eighth grade. Todd thinks not saying who won right away was wrong. He says it made students think that their votes were not important.\n\nMelissa Daar Carvajal has twin sons. They are in sixth grade. She said Lena may have been wrong to not say who won right away. Still, she thought Lena had a good reason. It is important to make sure all groups get a voice on the council.'"

Four years later, he had a college degree in math.\n\n## Talk About A Cool Job\n\nThis year, Moshe began taking online classes. He wanted to get a master's degree. It is the next step after a college degree. Moshe had to stop taking classes, though. He got a job with NASA, the United States space agency. He helps make technology for airplanes.\n\nMoshe is busy with his job and school. Still, he makes time for many hobbies. He wrote a book. It was about being bullied by other kids.

He says he is more normal than they think. He is interested in many things. He learned about different cultures growing up. His mother is from Asia.

He tries to not compare himself with others.\n\n\"I just try to do the best I can,\" he says.\n\nMoshe was a quick study. His parents say that when he was 4 months old, he pointed to a jet in the sky. He said the Chinese word for airplane. That was his first word. When he was only 7, he took a hard math class called trigonometry. Most students learn this in high school. Soon Moshe needed harder classes. His mom drove him to community college. His classmates were about 10 years older than Moshe.\n\n## Big Birthday Countdown\n\nMoshe was surprised when NASA gave him a job. He had applied before but he was too young then. Now Moshe was perfect for a project. He uses math and computers to make airplane technology.\n\nMoshe wants to finish his master's degree someday. Then he wants to start his own computer science company.\n\nFirst, he has a bigger goal. He is counting down the days until he turns 18. Then he will be able to get his driver's license.'"

They learn to guard their faces with their arms.\n\n## Ouch! A Bloody Nose\n\nOtherwise, they can get a bloody nose.\n\nThe team also has a dog. His name is Van Dyke.

A calf is a young cow.\n\n## Looking For A Good Horse\n\nA calf roper rides a horse and chases a calf. He or she tries to catch the calf with a rope. Then, the cowboy gets off the horse. He or she ties three of the calf's legs together. Bryce thought Bruce would be a good horse for calf roping.\n\nBefore Bryce had Bruce he had Maverick. Maverick was a great horse. He and Bryce got first place and $5,000 in last year's Prescott rodeo. Maverick was getting older. Bryce needed a new horse.\n\nBryce and Bruce did not do so well at the Prescott rodeo this year. They ran out to chase the calf too early. This is not allowed.\n\n## A Winning Ride!\n\nA few days later the cowboy goes to a rodeo in Taylor, Arizona. Bryce needs to win. If he does not, he might not make it to the National Finals Rodeo.\n\nAt the Taylor rodeo he got Bruce ready. The calf ran out of the gate.\n\nBryce and Bruce ran out. Bryce caught the calf with the rope. He tied its three legs together. He finished in 9.7 seconds. The time surprised him. It was his fastest time ever, even better than with Maverick.\n\n## Better Than Money: The Right Partner\n\nBryce did not even smile. An older cowboy told him \"Good ride.\"\n\nThis is the way it is in rodeos. He just got a handshake and $2,000.\n\nBryce left the rodeo with something even better than the money. He now knows he had been right. Bruce was a good rodeo horse. He and Bryce only needed the right partner.'"

What else is there?\n\n\"They were like, (it's) squash,\" Miller said. Squash is played with a racquet, like tennis. \"And I was like, I'm not learning that. It's not for me.\"\n\nMiller turned out to be pretty good at it. She just got a job full-time at the after-school squash program. It called SquashSmarts.\n\n## Not Just For The Rich\n\nPoor areas are not the usual place to find squash. People think it's only for the rich. Yet, SquashSmarts uses the game to help poor students. There are 15 city squash clubs around the country.\n\nThere are not many students but interest is growing. There are only about 1,400 city students who belong to squash clubs. They get free help in school. They also get to travel.\n\nAround the world, squash is a just regular game. It's played by millions of people in about 185 countries. In the U.S., the sport took a different path. Here, squash is played mostly by rich people in private clubs.\n\nBut squash is not just for the rich.\n\nThe first city squash program started in Boston in 1995. The program mixed fitness with tutoring. Its goal was to keep students from leaving school. Over the next 10 years, the idea spread.\n\nIn Philadelphia, about 120 students belong to SquashSmarts. They are in the fifth through 12th grades.\n\n## \"I Love It Now\"\n\nSquashSmarts finds its players in public schools. Most students still don't know much about squash. But SquashSmarts gains new players all the same.\n\nJoshua Smith is 13. He wasn't very excited when SquashSmarts workers visited his school. His first thought was, \"What is squash? That's stupid.\"\n\n\"And then I tried it,\" Smith said, \"and I love it now.\"\n\nSquashSmarts keeps track of players' heart health and grades. Many kids in the area don't finish school. But everyone who stayed in the club for seven years has graduated. They all have gotten into college, said Stephen Gregg. He runs SquashSmarts.\n\nSakora Miller brings the program full circle, he said. Miller is now 23. She is finishing her studies at a college called Penn State. She is the first player from the program to get a job with SquashSmarts.\n\nShe shows that change is possible, Gregg said.'"
