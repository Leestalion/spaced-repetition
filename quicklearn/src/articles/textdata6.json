            "text": "\tHAVANA - In a workshop cluttered with pieces of old string instruments, three men carve strips of imported wood. Silently, they measure the angles of violin pegs and viola necks. The instruments around them are bent out of tune from years of use.\n\nHere in Cuba's capital city Havana, Andres Martinez and his two apprentices are doing what they can to help solve a problem. A country famous for its music is running low on musical instruments.\n\nCuba's dozens of free music schools turn out thousands of skilled young musicians each year. Many play imported instruments that can only be repaired with hard-to-find materials from overseas. String instruments are among the hardest to keep in good working order.\n\n## Old Quality Versus New Cheap Stuff\n\nBefore Cuba's 1959 revolution, many students played violins, violas, cellos and bass violins from European workshops. After its revolution, all that changed. It was cut off from doing business with many countries. Getting Western European instruments became much more difficult.\n\nFor many years, Russia provided Cuba with violins and cellos. These days, students must make do with inexpensive violins from China. Of poorer quality, Chinese violins pop strings and lose their tone too easily.\n\nMartinez and his apprentices repair dozens of instruments a year. They also make a handful from scratch. In addition, they train young people in the skills of violin making, in an attempt to create a Cuban violin business.\n\nMartinez, 41, says they \"do everything here\" from minor repairs to major fixes. \"It's a profession that requires a lot of dedication.\"\n\n## So Many Instruments Need Help\n\nMartinez's workshop opened three years ago. Since then, he has overseen the repair of more than 400 violins, violas, cellos and bass violins. He has also manufactured a dozen high-quality violins for professional musicians. The workshop also lends instruments to musicians who need them for concerts.\n\nMartinez uses high-end imported tools and varnishes for his repairs. He takes pride in the quality of his work. Such quality, he says, can't be found among amateur repairmen who use hammers to fix violins.\n\n\"Fiddle making isn't carpentry,\" he said.\n\nIn the past, Cuba did have a handful of world-class violin repairmen, but they have since left the country or died. Martinez's workshop is making up for their absence.\n\n\"This workshop fills a great need,\" music expert Miriam Escudero said.\n\n## Keeping The Workshop Running\n\nCuba did open a violin factory during the 1970s. However, when it comes to making musical instruments, Cuba's native cedar wood has nowhere near the quality of the best European woods like maple.\n\nRight now, Martinez's workshop needs money from outside groups to stay in operation. Some of that support comes from a Belgian group called Fiddlemakers Without Frontiers. Martinez says his next challenge will be making enough money so the workshop can survive on its own.\n\nThe future of Cuban music may depend, in a small way, on his success or failure.\n\n\"It's like with people,\" said workshop apprentice Juan Carlos Prado. \"If you feel bad, you need a doctor. The same thing happens with a musical instrument. If it isn't working well, you can hear it in the music.\"'"

For the first time in more than 50 years, Barbie can wear comfortable shoes.\n\nEver since Mattel first introduced Barbie in 1959, she's been forced to hobble around in high heels. Even when you took off her shoes, her plastic feet remained stuck on tiptoe.\n\n## Ankles Can Adjust For Flat Shoes\n\nThe 23 new \"Fashionista\" Barbie dolls have flexible ankles. Their feet adjust to wear either heels or flats. The dolls also come in a greater variety. They have eight skin tones, 14 face shapes, 22 hairdos, 23 hair colors and 18 eye colors.\n\n\"The Barbie Fashionistas line was designed to represent the world girls see around them,\" explained Ani Istanboulian. She is a spokeswoman for Mattel.\n\nIstanboulian said the \"Fashionista\" Barbie takes the doll to the next level.\n\nShe said new Barbies have \"authentic street style\" and many of them look great in flats.\n\n## Barbie \"Set Free Of Her Misery\"\n\nThe news created much online buzz this week. Many grown-ups who had long felt sorry for Barbie's sore feet reacted to the change in footwear.\n\n\"Finally, Barbie has been set free of her misery,\" MTV Style said.\n\n\"There's no word on if or when an official Mattel plus-size Barbie is in the works,\" said an online Cosmopolitan magazine article. \"In plastic world, this is all huge news.\" The piece was shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook. \"One small step for Barbie, one huge leap for womankind,\" the article said.\n\nMattel's Barbie website shows Fashionista dolls wearing flats.\n\n## Ad Says She's \"Ready For Anything\"\n\nThe \"Film Director\" doll wears jeans, scarf, pink top and black flats. With her new ankle, the doll \"can go from running-around-the-set flats to movie-premiere heels!\" the ad says.\n\nThe \"Pink Petals\" Barbie wears a feathery pink skirt and white tank top. She has a pair of silver flats and a matching silver bag, the website states.\n\nThe \"Teresa\" doll wears a jean skirt, a flower-print top and sandals. She's \"ready for anything dressed in a trendy outfit that's perfect for daytime or nighttime fun,\" the ad says.\n\nUnfortunately, the switch to flats hasn't solved one longtime problem for these Barbies. Mattel warns that the dolls with long legs still \"cannot stand alone.\"'"

            "text": "\tSOUNION, Greece - Scuba gear has little to do with the grace and beauty of dance. With their heavy air tanks, wetsuits, fins and masks, divers look more like astronauts than ballerinas.\n\nYet 14 dancers have climbed into scuba gear for an underwater ballet. Their audience could watch the performance from seats about 16 feet deep in the sea. The ballet takes place southeast of Athens, Greece, beneath an ancient temple of Poseidon - the ancient Greek god of the sea.\n\nThe scuba-diving dancers could be a world first.\n\nThe dance, called \"Drops of Breath,\" opened Friday. Unfortunately, the first audience had to stay on land and watch a previously recorded performance shown on a giant screen. The water was cloudy, so they would not have been able to see much.\n\n## Audience Can See At Bottom Of Sea\n\nWhen the water is clear, there are seats for 40 people below on the seabed. Another 40 people can swim on the water's surface and watch the performance with snorkel gear.\n\nThe dancers are mostly French and Greek, and include three who are disabled and three children. On a round, underwater stage, they float into and out of formations. Hand movements turn their breath into a fine mist of bubbles. Music comes from two underwater speakers and was written after much research into how sound travels through water.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of French choreographer Sophie Bulbulyan and Greek choreographer Apostolia Papadamaki. Choreographers invent dances. Bulbulyan's dance group is located in one of Paris' poorest neighborhoods and includes disabled dancers.\n\n## Choreographers Met While Diving\n\nThe two choreographers, who are both divers, met three years ago during a dive.\n\n\"We liked each other and then we started talking artistically, exchanging ideas,\" Papadamaki explained. One day after a fun dive, they suddenly came up with the idea for a underwater ballet. \"Let's see if it's possible, an underwater dance performance,\" she said.\n\nIt was possible, but not easy.\n\n\"This project is like going to the moon on a bike,\" said Bulbulyan. \"There was an enormous amount of difficulties.\"\n\nFor a start, all the dancers had to learn to dive. Even harder, they had to learn to control their breathing so that they could hover upside down and sideways, or rise and fall without moving a muscle. Seventy percent of the performers were dancers who became divers - all in the last year.\n\n## Project Overcame Huge Challenges\n\nThen the two women had to organize all the details, from diving gear and transportation to finding the money to pay for the project. They also had to deal with changeable weather and political problems in Greece.\n\n\"I'm bringing a French dance group from the poorest neighborhood of France, which has handicapped people in its group, to Greece, a country in chaos,\" Bulbulyan said.\n\nThe music needed special thought and planning. Trifonas Koutsourelis is the composer who wrote the music. He needed to learn how sound travels underwater, so his music could be heard clearly and the dancers could move to it, since water slows down movement.\n\nIt took him two and a half months to write the music, said Koutsourelis, who added that he has not slept for the last three weeks.\n\n## Dance Felt Like \"Floating In Space\"\n\nFor the dancers, especially the disabled, the experience was \"beyond words,\" said Papadamaki.\n\n\"They feel equal. For the first time they can move without a wheelchair, without the restriction of somebody having to carry them,\" she said.\n\nIrini Kourouvani, who uses a wheelchair, has been a dancer for 15 years. She was worried about the water because she needed a flotation board to swim.\n\nShe was hooked from her first dive.\n\n\"I forgot to be afraid and to get scared, because I was so entranced by what I was seeing,\" Kourouvani said. \"I felt like I was floating in space, like I was on earth and the wind was coming and lifting me up.\"\n\nNow, she said, the deep is something \"I won't part with, because now I carry it within me.\"'"

            "text": "\tBOGOTA, Colombia - When the green men from Mars landed in the center of Cotocollao, Ecuador, 65 years ago, a stunned nation listened in. One of the country's most famous radio hosts was turned to dust by a death-ray. Firefighters and police rushed to the small village to face the aliens.\n\nThe radio announcer was still alive, in fact. But by the end of the night, at least six others would be dead as furious mobs discovered they had fallen for a stunt.\n\nWhen Orson Welles produced his version of \"The War of the Worlds\" in 1938, it generated a firestorm in the United States. Thousands of people believed the realistic radio show that described an alien invasion in New Jersey. The program was based on H.G. Wells' famous novel.\n\nThe program spread throughout Latin America, where radio shows tried to copy it.\n\n## Broadcasts Blamed For Panic\n\nIn 1944, in Chile, a version of the radio show was blamed for panicking thousands of people. One man died of a heart attack.\n\nBut in the tiny nation of Ecuador, the stunt was pulled off so convincingly that even the authorities seem to have fallen for the story.\n\nJorge Ribadeneira was 19 when Radio Quito staged its fake alien attack. It was Saturday night, and the station interrupted its broadcast to announce that an enormous spaceship had crashed in Cotocollao, which was located north of Quito, the capital.\n\nMoments later, Leonardo Paez was rushed to the scene. He was one of Quito's best known radio personalities. As Paez broadcast \"live\" from Cotocollao, a long \"green arm\" emerged from the alien ship and Paez was fried by a bolt of light.\n\nThe radio reported that the alien clash with the armed forces might release a toxic cloud. People in Quito panicked and tried to escape the city.\n\n\"There were people running around all over the streets and the army and police were heading toward Cotocollao,\" said Ribadeneira, now 83.\n\n## A Crowd Enraged\n\nThe original \"War of the Worlds\" script had been translated into Spanish for Chilean broadcasters. Later, Eduardo Alcaraz took the Chilean script to Ecuador and there he found Paez.\n\nPaez was a poet, playwright, reporter, radio actor and songwriter who composed some of Ecuador's most famous music.\n\nPaez received much of the blame for the tragedy. He was accused of creating panic by planting stories in the local newspaper and failing to warn the audience that the show was fake.\n\n\"There are so many stories about him, but most of them are just legends,\" said Ximena Paez, 63, the broadcaster's daughter.\n\nWhat is known is that on the night of Feb. 12, 1949, the city was seized by panic as the show kept upping the stakes. Radio Quito patched in other broadcasters who were also \"reporting\" the arrival of alien ships. Police and firefighters were sent to Cotocollao.\n\nThe radio station soon realized that it had gone too far. But, when it shut down the show and tried to reassure the audience it was fake, it only enraged the crowd. A mob surrounded the radio station in Quito and set it ablaze.\n\n\"We saw an enormous fire,\" remembers Ribadeneira. \"And we could hear the announcer, whose name was Luis Beltran, calling for help. He was saying 'Please let the firefighters through,' but the people wouldn't let them pass.\"\n\nOther reports say that the police couldn't respond because they were in Cotocollao.\n\n## \"People Died\"\n\nXimena Paez said her father believed that police didn't react because they were embarrassed over having fallen for the trick. Paez, Alcaraz and Beltran survived. But at least six people died, including Paez's girlfriend, says Ribadeneira. He wrote a brief history of the event.\n\nFor Orson Welles, \"The War of the Worlds\" was a turning point. The event turned him into an international sensation. He spun his fame into a movie career that included the making of the classic \"Citizen Kane.\"\n\nThe outcome for Alcaraz and Paez is more complicated. Ecuador investigated the event, so Alcaraz fled to Mexico. He stayed there until his death, says Ribadeneira and others.\n\nPaez's daughter said that after going into hiding for about three months, Paez was found to be innocent. He worked for six more years in Ecuador, winning national theater awards. In 1955 he moved to Venezuela and died there in 1991.\n\nXimena said \"The War of the Worlds\" was a bittersweet memory for him.\n\n\"He was proud of it because it was such a good artistic production that people believed it,\" she said. \"But it was a tragedy because people died.\"'"

Dupuis has also volunteered to teach students in the city who face poverty and hardship. But they are determined to overcome these obstacles one string at a time.\n\n\"These kids are so brave, so strong and they work so hard,\" said Dupuis.\n\n\"If I had to deal with half the things they do at that age, I'd have given up long ago,\" she said.\n\n## From Boxes To Violins\n\nDupuis has spent the past three years teaching young musicians at KIPP Ascend Primary School in Chicago. She and a KIPP school counselor, Joi Truman, began a free program to teach the kids there to play the violin. The program is called MUSIC Inc, which stands for \"Music in Urban Schools Inspiring Change.\"\n\nThe program began with little money and no violins. At first, the students learned on fake violins made from empty Lean Cuisine boxes. Soon, local violin-maker Michael Reuter donated 25 instruments. Dozens more used violins have been donated to the program in recent years.\n\nToday, the MUSIC program at KIPP has 12 families on a waiting list, Dupuis said. Officials also are trying to raise money to bring the program to more poor Chicago neighborhoods.\n\n## Parents Take A Bow\n\nThe program currently has more than 70 KIPP students, ages 7 to 10. To participate, Dupuis said students must meet leadership goals. They must display responsible behavior in the classroom and complete homework assignments.\n\nThe children are given a violin and a song book so they can practice at home.\n\nDupuis teaches them violin through the Suzuki method. In the Suzuki method, parental involvement is important. Parents attend all the lessons and become \"home teachers\" for their children. MUSIC holds family classes on Saturdays at KIPP to teach parents how to help their children practice outside of the classroom.\n\nAshley Wiggins has a fourth-grade daughter in the program. She said her daughter has developed far more than just musical ability.\n\n## Learning More Than Music\n\n\"Madison used to be really shy, but she just played her violin before a few hundred people at a youth pageant at our church,\" Wiggins said. \"This is something that never occurred to me, because I don't play an instrument, but playing the violin has helped Madison develop into a person who is responsible. She takes such good care of her instrument. She's much more confident and has the ability now to speak in front of a group.\"\n\nWiggins is a mother of two with a full-time job. She said she enjoys attending the program's Saturday violin classes for parents.\n\nMelissa Cowell is a third-grade teacher at KIPP. She helps with the program. She said she learned to play the viola with private lessons as a child growing up in a wealthy suburb of Chicago.\n\n\"String education can be very expensive, even if it just means providing the instrument,\" Cowell said. The free MUSIC program levels the playing field, she said. It enables kids from poor families an equal chance to learn an instrument like kids from wealthier families.'"

Shakespeare's unhappy Prince Hamlet is seeing  the world.\n\nActors from Shakespeare's Globe, a theater in London, hope to perform \"Hamlet\" in every country and territory in the world. By last count, that's more than 200 in all.\n\nThis week the production found itself in New York City, at the headquarters of the United Nations. The show received a standing ovation from top diplomats. The drama onstage gave the diplomats a couple hours break from real drama going on around the world like the crises in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\"It's an absolute delight to be here. It's extraordinary. It feels very, very odd. But very pleasurably odd,\" said Dominic Dromgoole, artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe. \"We like bold ideas. We like bold, simple - some would say stupid - ideas.\"\n\n## Simple Scenery\n\nSo far, the tour has already visited 28 countries and traveled 19,295 miles (31,053 kilometers). The tour began this spring in London. The production's home is a reconstructed 16th-century theater on the River Thames.\n\nOn the road for two years, the production must travel light. The scenery for \"Hamlet\" is simple: just a few trunks, sheets, wood beams and rope. Each actor plays more than one character. They also play instruments such as drums, violins and mandolins.\n\nThe U.N. is not the first unexpected place these actors have performed. They have put on the play in opera halls, market places and beaches. The troupe hopes to visit all the world's countries, including Iraq, North Korea and Syria. They also hope to perform in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank.\n\nIt's important to include every country and territory, Dromgoole said. \"If you do start excluding anyone, you do have to ask the question 'Where do you start and where do you stop?'\"\n\n## A 12-Person Cast\n\nThe show has already played in some conflict zones. Russia and Ukraine are currently in a violent dispute. \"Hamlet\" was performed in both Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine's capital.\n\nThe production next moves on to Central America and the Caribbean. It will stop in the Bahamas on Wednesday and then move on to Mexico, Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica. Later this summer it will head to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nThe tour features a portable set. The 12-person cast includes actors from many cultures. Hong Kong-born actress Jennifer Leong and Maori actor Rawiri Paratene are among them. Two actors share the part of Prince Hamlet. London actor Naeem Hayat, and Nigeria-born Ladi Emeruwa trade off on the role.\n\nAn international audience is sure to have different views on the play, Emeruwa said.\n\n\"I think it'll mean different things to different people depending on what sort of situation they're in or what sort of situation their country is in as well,\" he said.\n\n## Marking Shakespeare's Life\n\nThe show's journey began on April 23 - Shakespeare's 450th birthday. It will end back in London on April 23, 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.\n\nThe actor Paratene hopes the play influenced the diplomats in some small way.\n\n\"It would be foolish of us to go in thinking that we could get the diplomats to operate better,\" he said. \"All we can do is tell the story.\" Paratene says that if the play causes \"the Israeli representative go to the other side of the room and sit next to the Palestinian representative and maybe kiss each other on the cheek and talk and listen, that would be very nice. But that's not what we're here to do. We're here to tell a story.\"\n\n\"Hamlet\" is the story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark. Hamlet is son of the king and heir to the throne. He is off studying in Germany. When he returns home to Denmark, he finds out from a ghost that his uncle has murdered his father, married his mother, and named himself king. Hamlet must decide what to do about this.'"

            "text": "\tBAGHDAD - Ann Khalid did not feel well. Still, she insisted on dancing a brief scene from the \"Swan Lake\" ballet with her classmates. The 12-year-old wants to have a career of dancing and teaching ballet.\n\nHer dream is not easy in Iraq, a country ripped apart by years by conflict.\n\n\"My school and my church are the two things I love the most in Baghdad,\" Khalid said with pride.\n\nIf she has a shot at her dream, it's because of the Baghdad School of Music and Ballet.\n\nThe school has survived many years of trouble. The Iraqi capital once was a Middle East center of culture, but has not been for years. Violence is now a part of daily life and strict religious ideas control how people must behave in public. Still, the school has carved out a tiny place for creativity.\n\n## School Once Thrived\n\n\"Where else in Iraq can you walk into a school and listen to a small boy playing Antonio Vivaldi on his violin?\" boasts Ahmed Salim Ghani. He is the school principal and an expert musician.\n\nAnother rare thing: The school isn't split up by boys and girls like almost all Iraqi schools. Male and female students take classes together from kindergarten to high school.\n\nGhani remembers Baghdad's golden age - the 1960s through to the 1980s - when the city's rich people supported art and culture. At the same time, the government had plenty of money from selling oil and gave some to the arts. The school, which started in 1968, thrived.\n\nBlack-and-white video of a 1977 school production of \"The Nutcracker\" shows a high level of dancing, with the children wearing professional-level costumes. In class photos from the time, the schoolgirls and female teachers wear miniskirts. The boys wear blazers and bow ties.\n\nThings went bad for Baghdad and the school after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The United Nations punished the country and oil couldn't easily be sold. Money was running low for the country and the school.\n\n## Invasion And Chaos\n\nThe city plunged deeper into chaos after 2003, when the U.S. and other countries invaded Iraq. People stole from the school days after Saddam Hussein was removed as president, and the school was was partially burned later.\n\nStrict religion rose and the ideas of religious leaders affected people's lives. Ballet was considered immoral and anti-Islamic, and even music was criticized.\n\nThe school removed its large street sign to escape attention. Children hid their musical instruments when out in public or left them at school.\n\nDaily bombings, assassinations and kidnappings forced parents to keep their children at home. The school's best Iraqi ballet and music teachers fled. During the worst times in the mid-2000s, the number of students plunged to an all-time low of 100 to 120, said Ghani.\n\nThe city has become safer, but bombings continue.\n\n\"We hope it is just a phase that will eventually go away,\" said Salam Arab. His 16-year-old son Maysara is one of the school's best male dancers. \"It's a rare school in the Arab world, and it is very important that it continues to carry out its mission.\"\n\nThe religious ideas throughout Baghdad's society have a powerful effect as well.\n\n## \"Everyone Says It Is Haram\"\n\nThe school now has around 500 students. But many parents pull their daughters out of ballet when they are 12 or 13. They object on religious grounds to the girls being lifted and held by boys their age while performing, says Zeina Akram Fayzy, a 40-year-old ballet instructor.\n\n\"Years of our hard work go to waste,\" said Fayzy, who graduated from the school.\n\nLeezan Salam, who graduated this year, said that when she started ballet at the school, there were around 30 girls with her. By the time she reached the 10th grade, \"we were only three.\"\n\nKhalid, the 12-year-old, says the moral questions surrounding dance don't dent her enthusiasm.\n\n\"Everyone says it is haram (religiously prohibited) and disgraceful. But my parents are happy for me to dance,\" she said.\n\nDance can be a problem for boys, too.\n\nMaysara said he doesn't tell people he dances. \"Those in my neighborhood who have found out often mock me,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Ahmed Abdulateef has a gift and a passion for music. In his hometown of Baghdad, Iraq, though, he is not free to play music. He has been threatened by men who feel his music does not fit with their strict version of Islam. His father smashed his guitar and kicked him out of the house.\n\nFor a while, Ahmed played in secret. Then he got a opportunity to join a cultural exchange program that allowed him to perform in the United States for one month.\n\nIn the United States, Abdullateef was free to walk down the street with his oud slung over his shoulder. The oud is a guitar-like Middle Eastern instrument.\n\n## Free To Play\n\n\"Here, for the first time, I'm Ahmed,\" he said.\n\nAbdulateef experienced freedom, and he loved it. He wanted to stay in the United States longer, to continue playing the music he loved. To do this, he applied for asylum on Nov. 24.\n\nAsylum is a system for people who are not safe in their own country for political, religious or artistic reasons. These people ask another country for permission to stay there, and if that country agrees, they can live there in safety.\n\nAlong with Abdulateef, many other Iraqis have applied for asylum in the United States. They are finding it to be a slow process that can take months or years for a decision.\n\n## It Will Be A Long Wait\n\nThe pipeline to deal with asylum-seekers has become clogged, immigration lawyers say. More conflicts in the Middle East have brought more refugees - people escaping violence - to the United States.\n\nThe U.S. government is deciding slowly, too. Government officials are worried that violent extremists may use the asylum system to sneak into the United States.\n\n\"I don't have a plan B,\" Abdulateef said. \"This is a new life, a whole new life, and it's worth fighting to stay here.\"\n\nThe point of the asylum system is to provide a safe place for foreigners who are threatened at home. It seems then, that Abdulateef's case should be an obvious \"yes.\"\n\nBefore he was allowed to visit the United States, Abdulateef went through many security checks. He was already fluent in English.\n\nAbdulateef's attorney, David Garfield, took his case for free. Garfield said even a clear case like Abdulateef's is not enough for a quick decision from the government.\n\n## Many Strong Cases To Stay\n\nGarfield is representing other Iraqis who also have strong cases. There are female doctors escaping kidnapping threats and a man who is being threatened because he converted to Christianity.\n\nThe cases have dragged on for nearly a year, and the Iraqis do not know what lies in their futures.\n\n\"It looks like they're just sitting on the Iraqi cases,\" Garfield said. \"All these letters, they just don't get responded to. There's been no decisions - no denials, no approvals.\"\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office handles asylum cases. It reported that 1,133 Iraqis applied for asylum in 2014. Only 788 applied the year before. Part of the rise could be due to the violent Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Islamic State is a radical group in Iraq and Syria that wants to set up its own country under strict Islamic law.\n\nToday, there are more than 1,300 asylum cases from Iraqis still open.\n\n## International Language of Music\n\nAbdulateef, who is 23, faces serious threats if he returns to Iraq. Violent fighters there have a history of attacking musicians and other artists.\n\nHis trip to the United States might have made things worse. He bonded with American musicians - playing Metallica on his oud. He was introduced to instruments like the mandolin.\n\nBecause the cultural exchange was paid for by the U.S. government, Abdulateef is now linked to the U.S. government in the eyes of Iraqi extremists.\n\nAbdulateef said he did not come to the United States with the idea of applying for asylum. He learned of the asylum process from American friends, who steered him to Garfield, the immigration attorney.\n\nTo apply for asylum, Abdulateef had to turn in an affidavit. That is an official document telling his story. While his experiences are unique, they also echo the faded hopes of many Iraqis who dream of living in a country where basic freedoms are protected.\n\n\"All I want is to be safe from fear and be able to continue my musical career,\" Abdulateef's affidavit says.'"

            "text": "\tELOY, Ariz. - Colombian musician Juanes and singer John Legend met immigrants at a jail in Arizona on Wednesday. The two performers put on a show for a small crowd outside the facility. They were hoping to draw attention to immigration.\n\nThe musicians each played two songs separately and one together. The duet was Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song,\" to which dozens of people sang along. The performance was outside the jail in Eloy, Arizona, about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix.\n\nAs the crowd cheered, Legend spoke. He said, \"The reason why we're here, one, is because we want to bear witness to what's happening so we could tell the world about it.\" \n\nJuanes played the guitar and Legend the piano. They sat on a flatbed truck parked across the street from the federal jail. An empty desert field was in the background. People in the crowd held large signs and chanted \"Not one more deportation\" and \"Si se puede,\" which is Spanish for \"Yes we can.\"\n\n## Performers Speak To Detainees\n\nThe concert was staged for an audience made up primarily of activists brought there by a group fighting for immigrants rights. Some relatives of detainees joined as well. The concert was filmed by a camera crew for a documentary and a broadcast of the performance on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nThe performers' original goal was for the detainees to hear the music. Yet organizers were told the inmates were not let out of their cells to hear the concert.\n\nEarlier, Juanes and Legend took a tour of the jail and spoke to detainees inside.\n\nJuanes said in Spanish that he was \"heartbroken\" by what he saw.\n\n\"It's very hard to understand that someone is deprived of their freedom unjustly,\" said Juanes, \"and that's why we're here with our music.\" He continued, saying that music \"is the strongest tool to bring attention and give a voice to those who don't have one.\"\n\n## \"Not Any Artist Would Do This\"\n\nMaria Gomez, of Phoenix, said the singers' visit will let immigrants know that people care about them. The 16-year-old said her brother and other relatives are being held in Eloy. They traveled from Mexico City to Nogales, Arizona, where they sought asylum. People facing danger in their home country can apply for asylum to stay in another country. Gomez said her family had been victims of kidnappings for ransom in Mexico.\n\n\"It's something very special because not any artist would do this,\" Gomez said.\n\nFrancisca Porchas is part of a group called Puente Arizona, which helped organize the event. She said her group's goal was for the singers to meet the detainees and families who have been fighting against strict immigration laws and raids. She said she hoped the visit would give detainees hope.\n\n\"For them it's something very important that they know they're not forgotten,\" Porchas said.\n\nThe organization transported about 60 people to the event in vans, while others drove on their own. Puente has been critical of the Eloy Detention Center over the deaths of several inmates. The group says immigration authorities aren't transparent about what goes on inside the jail.\n\n## Agency Feared Jail Disturbance\n\nThere are nearly 1,500 detainees being held in Eloy. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a government agency. It said in a statement it was \"committed to ensuring the safety and welfare of all those in its custody.\"\n\nICE said that during the afternoon of the concert, inmates on the south side of the jail \"were confined to their cells and residence pods\" for about an hour. The reason they gave for the confinement was concern that the unofficial concert was visible from the south recreation yard. The agency was concerned that this \"might cause a disturbance.\" They were restricted to protect \"both detainees' and employees' safety,\" said the agency.\n\nJuanes is a Latin American mega-star who has sold millions of albums. He topped the Billboard Latin chart in the United States for a record 92 weeks in a row with his song \"Un Dia Normal\" in 2002\\\\. Legend has won nine Grammys. Last year, he won an Oscar with the rapper Common for the song \"Glory\" from the film \"Selma.\"'"

            "text": "\tWhen Olivia Hernandez was in middle school, she decided to teach herself Korean.\n\nShe had became hooked on K-wave, South Korean pop music, television and culture.\n\nNow a student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Hernandez jumped at the chance to take a beginning class in the Asian language. She and other students are learning grammar and the proper way to address elders and bosses.\n\nTo make class more fun, the teacher usually shows a Korean rock music video. Once, Hernandez might have appreciated it only for the melody.\n\n\"Now I understand what they are saying. Now it makes sense,\" she said. Hernandez hopes to become a therapist and wants to use her Korean language skills in her job.\n\n## Sharp Rise In Past Decade\n\nAccording to a recent national study, the number of college students taking Korean classes is soaring. The Modern Language Association reported that students in Korean language classes rose 45 percent from 2009 to 2013. Overall, language studies declined 6.7 percent. Interest has dropped for many popular foreign languages, including Spanish, French and German.\n\nA total of 12,230 students take Korean across the country. It is still far from the most popular foreign language. Many more take Japanese, Chinese and Arabic. Currently, just 154 colleges offer Korean, but that is 70 percent more than a decade ago.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Korean popular culture in film and music has captivated the minds of young people,\" said Rosemary Feal. She helps lead the Modern Language Association.\n\nShe said that students take fewer foreign language classes because colleges lack the money to offer them. Also, students feel pressure to focus on classes that will help them get jobs later on. They take science and business classes, for instance, instead of history. Speaking a second language is important, Feal said. People who know foreign languages, for instance, can earn more money.\n\n## Video Hit \"Gangnam Style\"\n\nSome of the interest in Korean language class is coming from the children and grandchildren of Korean immigrants, according to college officials. It is non-Koreans, though, who are driving the increase in class signups.\n\nSome are drawn by the K-wave star Psy in his 2012 international video hit \"Gangnam Style.\" Others are big fans of the KoreanTV series \"Queen of Housewives.\" Students also may want to learn Korean because they are interested in working for Korean companies.\n\nAt UCLA, more people are signing up in both in the beginner Korean courses and in the \"heritage\" classes. The heritage classes are intended for Korean-Americans who know a little Korean but often don't know much grammar. Professors say they have waiting lists for the classes.\n\nLos Angeles \"is a great place to study Korean,\" said UCLA's head of humanities, David Schaberg.\n\nIn a recent heritage class, lecturer Jane Choi told her students about some of the complicated Korean ways to address people politely. She used illustrations from the \"Calvin and Hobbes\" comic strip. These examples showed how teachers and children in Korea speak to each other.\n\n## Learning The Alphabet\n\nAndrew Hahn is a senior at UCLA. He said his first language at home was Korean but that he does not speak it very well.\n\n\"As a Korean-American, it is only right to learn my native tongue and become comfortable with it. And it is a way to connect back with the culture,\" said Hahn, who is in the heritage class.\n\nLearning Korean, he said, will help him later when he works. He hopes to become a lawyer.\n\nNon-Korean students say that learning the alphabet is easy. Pronouncing some consonants can be difficult, though.\n\nFreshman Michelle King grew up in Salinas, California. She did not know anyone whose family was Korean. She became a fan of K-wave boy band Super Junior and the group Big Bang.\n\nKing is drawn by K-wave music. It's \"so different from American pop culture,\" she said.\n\n## Singing K-Wave Songs\n\nKing now majors in East Asian languages and hopes to become fluent in Korean.\n\nShe and other members of a campus club of K-wave fans recently visited Koreatown in Los Angeles. They shopped at a music store and ate at a Korean restaurant. They also sang along to K-wave music at a Korean club.\n\nIt's still hard for her to read Korean song lyrics fast enough to keep up. She is learning another important lesson though. Knowing another language, she said, \"breaks down barriers between people and teaches them to look beyond surface level.\"'"

They're laughing during their weekly radio show.\n\nMoments later, they turn more serious as they play Palestinian hip-hop. The discussion turns to the war in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting there. Heads nod in the packed bar to the rhymes of a Palestinian rapper.\n\nShorbaji and Alameh are among several Lebanese graffiti artists and rappers trying to reach unhappy youth. Lebanon - like much of the Middle East - is in the middle of political chaos and violence. The artists are trying to bring young people into a debate about the troubles.\n\n\"People don't want to be preached to. So we're just doing a fun thing in order to put out serious issues,\" said Alameh, 32.\n\n## Rapping About Society's Conflicts\n\nOne example is Shorbaji's latest music video for his song \"O.P.P.\" The song takes its title from the 1991 hit by U.S. hip-hop group Naughty By Nature. The remake by Shorbaji, 29, is about a bomber working as a bank clerk. The clerk is thinking about whether or not to bomb the bank.\n\nAnother example is rapper and graffiti artist Omar Kabbani, 31. He runs a rap, graffiti and street clothing group with his brother Mohamed.\n\n\"They say I was born with a microphone and my twin brother with a spray can,\" Kabbani said. \"We consider ourselves to be the eight o'clock news when we go out to do graffiti.\"\n\nKabbani says he wouldn't call their work political. Yet, their music and street art does not avoid Lebanese society's conflicts. Many of their designs feature \"Grendizer,\" a giant war robot from Japanese cartoons. They use Grendizer to make fun of people who blindly follow Lebanon's religious and political groups - and their private armies.\n\n\"Many people that were warlords in Lebanon are now ruling the country,\" Kabbani says. Lebanon went through a 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Leaders of armed groups during the war now run Lebanon's government.\n\n## \"Create And Change Visual Scenery\"\n\nThe Kabbani brothers' latest graffiti mural is about the recent bombings that shook Lebanon. It features the popular 1980s video game character Bomberman. He's shown running with a cartoon-like bomb in his hands, ready to blow up. Bomberman skips past the word \"Wanted,\" written in Arabic. Kabbani says the graffiti is about how Lebanese leaders use the threat of terrorism. He says they frighten people about the threat of terrorism to increase their power.\n\nJackson Allers is an American journalist in Beirut who writes about Arab hip-hop. Allers believes Lebanese artists are just beginning to discover how much power they have.\n\n\"Their influence is increasing,\" he said.\n\nAli Rafei, 28, is a graffiti and street artist from Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. Since civil war began in neighboring Syria, fighting has spilled over into Tripoli.\n\nRafei said decay in his city from the fighting has provided space for his street paintings. They can easily be seen and appreciated.\n\n\"The emptiness that's there pushes you to create and change visual scenery,\" he said. Rafei hopes to change people's views and reduce anger. People \"would prefer a drawing with colors and some meaning to them than a gray wall with pictures of politicians that do nothing for them.\"'"

Now, some fans want to learn to move like Jedis.\n\nLightsabers in hand, fans are meeting every other Saturday in a group called Magic City Jedi. They gather for a new yoga-meets-dance class that incorporates \"Star Wars\" Jedi moves with martial arts. Think Lightsaber Combat 101.\n\nThe 90-minute classes are held at I Am Equilibrium yoga studio in Doral, Florida. Longtime friends Alfred Smith and Santiago Martinez started the class. The pair believes South Florida needs a place where people can play-fight with lightsabers to escape the daily grind of their jobs.\n\nMartinez, 38, works at a Miami bank. \"We knew there was going to be interest because there are 'Star Wars' fans everywhere,\" he said. \"As old as the movies are, there are certain ideas and ways of behaving that can translate to real life.\n\n\"What kid doesn't want to be Luke Skywalker or Han Solo? What kid doesn't want to swing a stick like a laser? This is something that allows me to forget what is going on in my life and go into the class and live out a fantasy.\"\n\n## Escaping Daily Grind With Little Fantasy\n\nSmith said he studied the moves that lightsaber groups in San Francisco, California, and New York City, New York, performed. Based on what he saw, he began developing his own class with Santiago. Although their project was in the works for a long time, the December release of \"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,\" the series' latest movie, \"put fuel to the fire,\" said Smith.\n\nSmith, 40, is a yoga teacher in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \"I have been following this for some time, lightsaber combat in general,\" said Smith. \"I'm a big 'Star Wars' fan.\"\n\nAt a recent Saturday class, 17 barefoot men, women and children lined up in rows before Smith and Martinez. Some students brought their own fancy toy lightsabers that light up and make electronic laserlike sounds. Others used the class sabers made of plastic pipes wrapped in colorful pool noodles.\n\n\"Star Wars\"-themed shirts were everywhere. A teen girl had one that read: \"Physically, I'm here, mentally I'm in a galaxy far, far away.\"\n\n## Learning Mental Discipline - Like A Jedi\n\nBefore they could learn Yoda's moves, however, the students had some meditation and yoga to do.\n\n\"This is balance, this is presence, attention,\" Smith told the students as they performed the tree pose. \"Throughout the movements and throughout the practice, you are engaged.\"\n\nThe teachers then reviewed lightsaber defensive and offensive techniques.\n\nWith their strongest foot forward, students lurched their sabers downward to each side, and then up to the mid-section and eventually to the head.\n\n\"Imagine you are drawing an 'S,'\" Smith said, watching as the students practiced in pairs.\n\n## One, Two, Three - Strike!\n\nEach lesson tied into a Jedi theme.\n\n\"A Jedi is always aware of everything, not just what they are focusing on but also their surroundings,\" Smith said.\n\nAlthough the teachers were serious, some of the wannabe Jedis giggled as they lifted their sabers and struck their partners. One student wore a GoPro camera on his headband to capture every step.\n\nThe students learned several new moves. One was called a \"flourish,\" scurrying forward or back while twirling the lightsaber like a baton. They also learned how to \"bash,\" which is a fast forward attack that ends with a recoil.\n\n\"If you think of a snake, it's a quick strike,\" said Santiago, as he demonstrated the move. \"Every 'Star Wars' movie starts with a bash. ... It's a hit and pull back.\"\n\nClass ended with a final meditation.\n\n## Making Yoda Proud\n\nEveryone ended the class with a smile. Most agreed it made for a fun workout.\n\n\"You really feel like a Jedi,\" said Valerie Villar, 26, of Kendall, Florida, who attended the class with boyfriend Gerry Brenes, 29. \n\n\"It's a great opportunity to continue to live out that fantasy,\" said Brenes. \"Just the sense of centering yourself and meditating.\"\n\nVictoria Diaz, 17, brought her best friend to class. She said she signed up because she \"wanted to learn how to become a Jedi, and this is the closest thing to becoming one.\"\n\nThe class was Frankie Andollo's third. The 35-year-old from Coral Gables, Florida, brought his copy of Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber to class and wore a T-shirt from the new movie.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Jose Torres loves mariachi. Mariachi is a style of traditional Mexican music he grew up with. You might think that his children, growing up in Chicago, would not share his taste. Kids are more likely to seek out new pop music than listen to their parents' favorite songs.\n\nBut his 12-year-old daughter Alexa is learning mariachi at school. She is participating in a new Chicago Public Schools program that teaches students to play the traditional Mexican music.\n\nAlexa goes to Richard Edwards Elementary School. It is a magnet school that offers unique classes on Chicago's South Side. A magnet school often attracts students from far and wide with special interests and talents. In addition to math, English and history, Richard Edwards Elementary teaches students about Hispanic arts.\n\n## Families Become Closer\n\nTorres says that mariachi is bringing his family together. \"She's asking questions about her family, her background,\" Torres said while sitting outside Alexa's music classroom.\n\nRichard Edwards is one of five Chicago schools that added mariachi programs this year. The programs were introduced by the Mariachi Heritage Foundation, a group that brings mariachi to Chicago public schools.\n\n\"It gives parents the opportunity to have a topic they can speak on,\" said Cesar Maldonado, the president of the Mariachi Heritage Foundation.\n\nMaria Pulido teaches music at Richard Edwards. She has noticed how interested parents are in the mariachi program. She said that a line formed outside of her classroom door at this year's parent-teacher conferences.\n\n\"Last year, I never had any parents come talk to me,\" she said.\n\nPulido is teaching students to play mariachi songs on violin. The program eventually will also include mariachi singing.\n\n\"That's something the parents can say 'Wow, I know that song. I used to sing that song when I was young,'\" she said.\n\n## New Music Appreciation\n\nMariachi is often performed by groups of musicians playing string instruments and trumpets. Players usually wear brightly colored costumes. Mariachi songs can be fast or slow and come from various regions of Mexico.\n\nAlexa said she now appreciates mariachi music.\n\n\"I find it more interesting because I understand now what goes into it,\" she said.\n\nStarting a mariachi program for elementary school students is not easy. Marcia Neel organizes mariachi programs in schools around the country. She said one challenge is getting people to take mariachi as seriously as they do older music programs like orchestra and band.\n\nShe hopes that will change. \"The key was to take mariachi from being an out-of-school thing and put it into the school day,\" she said.\n\n## More Classes On The Way\n\nMoney is also a concern, Maldonado said. This year's five programs cost $300,000. He bought 450 violins with the money, and in January he hopes to buy more mariachi instruments and expand to seven other schools. Nearly 40 Chicago schools are on a waiting list.\n\n\"Until we get it to every school in the district that wants it we won't stop,\" he said.\n\nChicago is not alone in bringing mariachi into the classroom. The traditional Mexican folk music is being taught in dozens of areas nationwide in cities including Las Vegas, San Antonio, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona.'"

His trips aren't vacations though; the viola and violin teacher is going there to teach music.\n\nThis summer, Hurley is going to Beirut, Lebanon. He will be going to a kind of summer camp for students who already have some musical training. The students rehearse and put on a concert at the end of the visit.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. government helps send musicians, dancers and teachers overseas in hopes that the artists will spread goodwill for America around the world.\n\nThe idea to send artists overseas got its start in the 1950s. That's when the United States sent jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong and others abroad to showcase the special American art form.\n\nThe programs have since exploded. The latest rage is hip-hop.\n\n## It's All One Language - Music\n\nHurley says the experiences he's had in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Thailand have been life-changing for him and he thinks the experiences have changed the lives of his students as well.\n\n\"It's opened my eyes to other places,\" he said.\n\nThe teaching is slower because the students don't speak English. Because of this, the teachers must use their hands and the language of music. In the end, it all comes together for the big final concert.\n\n\"It's always great,\" Hurley said. \"You've worked so hard to pull it off in two weeks' time. The parents are proud. The kids are proud.\"\n\nThe Beirut program has 100 students, including several from Syria and Iraq.\n\n\"I think it brings goodwill toward us, and goodwill happens person by person,\" said Hurley.\n\nThe U.S. government pays for these kinds of programs.\n\n\"With than half of the world's population under age 30, it's especially important for us to provide avenues for connecting with youth,\" said Susan Pittman, a spokeswoman for the government.\n\n## A Popular Program\n\nThe idea is to use the arts to push the U.S. government's interests in other countries. Performers and teachers have been eager to sign up for the program.\n\nOklahoma City musician Kyle Dillingham plays the fiddle. With his band, Horseshoe Road, he likes introducing foreign audiences to Western swing, folk music, bluegrass and jazz. His band recently completed a 16-day tour in Liberia, in West Africa. It performed for Liberia's president, as well as in a town with no electricity.\n\n\"At the heart of what we do is sharing our music with these people and giving these people a taste of American culture,\" Dillingham said. He also holds student workshops.\n\n## Hip-Hop Goes Global\n\nHip-hop artists are the most requested groups by foreign nations. Rodney Hill and a troupe of dancers were in Central Asia earlier this year. In 2012, they performed in Egypt, Israel and Palestinian territories. Hill also held classes and gave talks.\n\nThe surprise may be that hip-hop is now so well-known because of social media. The students were even able to notice differences in style. For instance, they could spot West Coast style, which has a laid-back feel, Hill said.\n\n\"We did what we did; tell hip-hop through a story, and people gravitated to us,\" Hill said. \"They knew it on YouTube and multimedia.\"\n\nMark Katz, a music professor at the University of North Carolina, is leading a new two-year program for the government, which is all about hip-hop.\n\nKatz, who has written a book about hip-hop DJs, says hip-hop is global.\n\nKatz has taken hip-hop teams - disc jockeys, rappers, beat makers and dancers - to India and Serbia. In September, he will go to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to Montenegro.\n\nIn India, Katz said, the students loved everything about the experience.\n\n\"They meet Americans,\" he said. Katz believes it shows a different side of America. He thinks it helps students see that not all Americans are the same. \"The idea is they will think positively of the U.S.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO, Ill. - Sophia Pellar plays the flute in her New Trier High School pep band. The noise from the band used to hurt her ears. The pain ended after an ear doctor gave her some special earplugs.\n\nThe earplugs are designed to protect musicians from hearing loss. Still, Sophia giggles nervously when she explains that the earplugs have yet to become part of her regular routine.\n\nSophia, who is 16, said pep band can be \"crazy loud.\" She wears the earplugs then. \"But the thought of wearing them every day is a little embarrassing,\" she said.\n\n## Parents Are Usually Unaware\n\nResearch indicates that as many as 1 in 5 teens suffers from hearing loss. Much of that hearing loss is caused by noise damage. More doctors and school band directors are urging kids to protect their hearing. In some cases, they provide earplugs. Yet experts say their messages are not working as well as they can. The reason is students think it is \"uncool\" to wear earplugs. The same thinking once kept people from using bike helmets, shin guards and sunscreen.\n\nThe music educators now being trained at colleges and universities are learning about the problem. They are told that they should teach the importance of students protecting their hearing during rehearsals and performances. Still, officials say that parents typically are unaware that their children need to protect their ears.\n\n## The Music Gets Louder\n\nSophia's mother is Chimene Pellar. She became alarmed recently when she learned that Sophia is often in pain after playing her flute in tight space with her fellow musicians.\n\n\"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade,\" said Pellar, a doctor. \"I also have concerns when I walk by my kids when they have their earbuds in and I can still hear their music. And the longer they listen, the louder it seems to get.\"\n\nMedical professionals who study teen hearing loss say loud music from instruments, concerts and earbuds can harm the hair cells inside the ear. The result is hearing damage that builds up over time. The damage cannot be reversed.\n\nMore teenagers have hearing loss, said Dr. Henry Ou. The increase \"is not a surprise when you look at our society, which has gotten busier, nosier and overstimulated,\" Ou said. He studies ear, nose and throat medicine at Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Sound is just energy,\" Ou said, and when it is too loud, sound \"can cause damage.\"\n\n## An Uncomfortable Ear Needs Earplugs\n\nThe National Association for Music Education has a message for teachers and band directors. The group wants them to address the dangers of noise-induced hearing loss. They suggest, for example, making sure that students are not performing at high volume levels for a long time.\n\nMusic teachers and band directors can encourage behavior, Michael Butera, who runs the association, said. But teachers cannot force students to wear earplugs, he said.\n\nAt Barrington High School, band director Randy Karon said he often talks to his students about the need to protect their hearing. They need to do this both during practice and performances and outside of the band program, too, Karon said.\n\n\"My general rule is, if your ear feels uncomfortable at any time, put a pair of earplugs in,\" Karon said. He even keeps a large jar in the band room stocked with foam earplugs for his students.\n\nKaron said he also is increasingly aware of the need to protect his own hearing.\n\n\"Music is my livelihood, and if I can't hear, I'm in trouble,\" he said.\n\n## Drummers Already Use Them\n\nAt New Trier, band director Matt Temple's music program is one of 400 nationwide participating in Etymotic Research's Adopt-a-Band program. The program pairs schools with local ear doctors. The doctors give earplugs to students.\n\nEtymotic is a company that manufactures earplugs. The company sells new earplugs that it says are smaller and less obvious. They made these because some people did not want to be seen wearing earplugs.\n\nTemple said it was not clear if his musicians will wear their new earplugs beyond pep band season.\n\nHe said a lot of the drummers and percussion members \"already have form-fitted earplugs, and they wear them a lot.\" However, Temple added that many teenagers think they cannot be hurt.'"

The Polish-Canadian classical musician might not know what he'll be getting for his birthday, but at least he knows it will be an exciting one. Lisiecki will turn 20 on his way to perform for the first time in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"We're going to get some warm weather, which is always nice when you live in Canada,\" Lisiecki said. He lives in Calgary with his parents, who will be traveling with him to Abu Dhabi.\n\n## His Passport Packs A Punch\n\nLisiecki will also be going to Spain. He will wrap up his travels with a March 28 concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. The Kennedy Center's website shows the March 28 recital is sold out.\n\nOf course, Lisiecki won't sit still for long after that. He will return to the Kennedy Center on April 7 to appear as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nLisiecki's birthday tour only adds to the accomplishments that he has racked up in the past five years or so. When he was 15, Lisiecki signed a contract to make albums for Deutsche Grammophon, a classical music record company. He started making appearances at famous concert halls all over the world. He played with the New York Philharmonic and played in London. He even starred in a season-opening concert for the Orchestre de Paris in France.\n\n## Bach To His Roots\n\nLisiecki juggles an intense schedule of concerts and recordings. When he played with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 2014, he performed three times in one week.\n\nPart of Lisiecki's success has to do with the fact that he simply enjoys being at the piano. He describes it as a different world altogether - a colorful world where anything can happen. \"I think that also communicates to the audience,\" Lisiecki says.\n\nLisiecki's March 28 performance will include pieces from Bach and Mendelssohn. Lisiecki, who has roots in Poland, will also play pieces by Polish composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Besides being a composer, Paderewski was also the first prime minister of Poland after World War I.\n\nThe program will also include all 12 of the etudes in Chopin's \"Opus 10.\" The etudes aren't often played together. Lisiecki wants to give his audience the rare opportunity to hear the pieces in order. He says it will help them get the \"big idea\" that links the etudes together.\n\n\"That gives the audience a different feeling - a special feeling - and really also demonstrates Chopin's genius.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - At a small park in Santa Monica, a group of Los Angeles musicians gathered. All wore dark blue and orange T-shirts printed with the words \"Listen Up!\"\n\nSoon, union leaders, a minister and a local city councilman had the crowd fired up. They called on the Lionsgate movie studio to \"stop sending musicians' jobs overseas.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake, music that we produce\" is critical to the \"success of any film that's produced here,\" said Neil Samples, a violinist. \"We say to Lionsgate: Abandon the low road, stop offshoring jobs, do the right thing and bring the music home.\"\n\n## The Movie Gets Whisked Away\n\nThe rally is the latest sign of problems between local musicians and their employers. The American Federation of Musicians (AFM) is the union representing the LA musicians. It has previously organized rallies against Marvel Studios. The union accused Marvel of hiring London musicians to work on such movies as \"The Avengers\" and \"Iron Man 3.\" Those films were shot in the United States. Therefore, they said, they should have used American musicians.\n\nThis time the union has singled out Lionsgate. It says the studio is hiring foreign musicians to record music for movies filmed in the United States.\n\nIt has pointed to such Lionsgate releases as \"The Hunger Games\" and \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn,\" which were scored in London, and the recently released \"Draft Day.\" The Kevin Costner movie about the NFL draft was filmed in Ohio, but was scored in Macedonia.\n\n\"'Draft Day' - what could be more American than that?\" said violinist Rafael Rishik. \"To say with a straight face that the only way we could do this without going broke is to score this in Macedonia - it's hard for us to swallow.\"\n\nA spokesman for Santa Monica-based Lionsgate declined to comment.\n\n## The Local Industry Is Nervous\n\nThe unrest comes at a time of growing anxiety in the local music industry. For many years, film and television work have been a key source of income for hundreds of local musicians.\n\nA large movie can employ more than 100 musicians.\n\nFor that reason, Hollywood has long been a major draw for some of the world's top musicians. But as more filming has moved overseas, local musicians are having a tougher time making a living.\n\nOn any given day, about 2,000 local AFM members will work on a film or TV show. But their earnings have fallen heavily in recent years. In 2007, union members collectively made $30 million in wages. Now, they earn about $15 million a year.\n\nIf the decline continues, LA's musicians may leave to work elsewhere.\n\n\"One of the fantastic things about being a musician in LA is that you're surrounded by\" great players, said violinist Marc Sazer. \"We have the stars from the whole world gathered in the LA musical community. As more work goes off to London, Bratislava and Prague, that's going to disappear.\"\n\n## It's A Financial Battle\n\nThe American Federation of Musicians might be facing an uphill battle.\n\nMusicians traditionally could count on film work being done in LA. This was true even when a movie was shot elsewhere, because of the high level of talent here.\n\nBut these days, more film and TV production is leaving the state. Studios are taking advantage of tax benefits that aren't available in California.\n\nThe number of movie-scoring jobs has declined 50 percent in the last five years.\n\nMuch of the work has gone to Britain. However, orchestras in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Macedonia also are attracting more Hollywood business.\n\n\"Every orchestra in the world would love to be doing Hollywood movies,\" said union official John Acosta. They've been trying very hard \"to market themselves\" to Hollywood, he added.\n\nThere's also growing pressure from studios to save money by hiring lower-cost musicians in Europe. Hourly rates there are a fraction of what they are locally.\n\nFor example, musicians in Macedonia might get paid only $10 to $15 an hour. By comparison, musicians in LA receive $75 an hour.\n\n\"Everyone is looking to save money,\" Acosta acknowledged. \"Composers want to save as much money as they can upfront.\"'"

            "title": "Street signs mark the spot, of rap lyrics",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES -Tony Castillo noticed something new. He was skateboarding down Fairfax Avenue one December morning, like he had for more than two years.\n\nA bright red sign with white text stared him in the face. It was clasped to the streetlight pole in front of the sneaker store Flight Club. It looked like a regular street sign, but there were no instructions on parking, driving or walking. Instead, it displayed the words to a rap song. And the words referred to the very spot Castillo had just gone by.\n\nBun B the OG like '95 Air Max / Neon green outta Flight Club off Fairfax\n\nHours later, the 25-year-old from the Venice, Calif., area found himself sweeping in front of his store next door and gravitating toward the sign again. He set to work in removing the sign from where it was. After about 15 minutes of working, Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.\n\n\"I can see the energy the artist put into it,\" he said. \"This is some really thoughtful stuff.\"\n\n## Street Signs Taken\n\nArtist Jason Shelowitz installed 45 of the 46 signs he had designed for Los Angeles County in December. Shelowitz, also known as Jay Shells, believes all the signs he put up have disappeared.\n\nThe newspaper staff searched for 19 and found only bits of one. A spokesman for the city of Los Angeles said it is against the law to post signs on public property without a permit, but the city has no record of removing any of the signs.\n\nSome signs have been taken by street-art enthusiasts like Castillo. At least one quoted artist took his sign for himself. Rappers including Murs, Action Bronson and Lupe Fiasco have shown they approve of the project using social media. They have been posting pictures of their signs on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.\n\nShelowitz said he is going to return to Los Angeles later this month. He plans to put up six new signs around town. Gallery 1988 on Melrose Avenue plans to exhibit limited edition signs and photos of signs starting in April.\n\n\"I was thinking (the signs) would be a hidden gift for people who pay attention to their surroundings,\" Shelowitz said. \"I wanted it to be something where if you happened to see it, you'd be like, 'That's ... awesome!' - and just take a minute.\"\n\n## A Corner In New York\n\nGrowing up in the suburbs of New York, he was surrounded by music. He and his friends drove into the city to see live hip-hop. As they got older, some became DJs and producers. \"Never quiet,\" he said. \"Always on.\"\n\nYears later, in his home studio on the Upper East Side, Big L's track \"Lifestylez Ov Da Poor &amp; Dangerous\" started playing one day. The song warns against late-night trips to a park at the corner of West 139th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York. Shelowitz contemplated the lyric, and the seed for the project took root.\n\n\"I think I just realized at that moment - I had never been there,\" he said. And when he arrived, \"I just thought it would be so cool to mark that corner with the lyric.\"\n\nSoon he was sending mass emails and requests on social media. He asked people for any rap lyric that mentioned a very particular location. After the suggestions rolled in, he put up more than 50 signs in New York. Months later, he carted 46 signs to Los Angeles during a holiday visit.\n\nShelowitz took to Twitter in late December. He sent out pictures of each sign's location, weeks after he put them up.\n\nBut by then, the treasure hunt had already begun, and most of the signs were gone.\n\n## Stealing His Own Sign\n\nAnwar Carrots, 23, took it upon himself to steal his own sign.\n\nCarrots showed up at a friend's listening party at Diamond Supply Co. several weeks ago. He was immediately greeted by chatter about his sign.\n\n\"What quote?\" he wondered, so a friend took him a few steps outside. There he saw words he had rapped at age 17 \"just for fun\" with his friend Casey Veggies.\n\n\"I kind of freaked out,\" said Carrots, who helps run a clothing and management company. \"I'm not a rapper ... the lyrics are off (and) I had seen those quotes when I go to New York sometimes, so I was like, 'This is legendary.'\"'"

            "text": "\tWOODSTOCK, N.Y. - In this school, students will be encouraged to bang their heads and whip their hair.\n\nStudents at Woodstock Music Lab will practice fancy finger work alongside guitar heroes. Jamming in class will be encouraged. Assignments will include recreating the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds.\" Making a rock album based on Egyptian mythology will also be part of the program.\n\nStudents will learn these activities when a rock music school opens in the famous Catskill Mountains. Think of music school -- just with the sound of screeching guitar. Co-founder Paul Green sees the school as a \"giant, fertile petri dish\" where young guitarists and producers rub shoulders with one other.\n\n## Roll Over, Beethoven! Make Room For Adele\n\nGreen recently showed off the old elementary school that will become the Woodstock Music Lab. \"Odds are you can step out of the studio and say, 'I need a saxophone,' and some other kid here working on a jazz project will say, 'I'll be right down!'\" he said.\n\nGreen is a talkative rock teacher who has opened rock schools in the past. Michael Lang co-founded the college with Green. Lang organized the original 1969 Woodstock music festival. The famous festival took place in a muddy field some 50 miles from here and featured performances by Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.\n\nThe Woodstock Music Lab founders have raised several million dollars. However, they need twice that amount to open the school. They hope to open as early as next year. The founders reached a milestone this summer when they bought an elementary school for $1 million. It is located a few miles from Woodstock's central village.\n\n## This Is Not The School Of Bach\n\nWalking through empty classrooms this week, Green and Lang described where performance spaces will be. The gym will become a recording studio big enough for an orchestra. Students will attend the school for two years. They will learn about performing, production, arranging and marketing.\n\n\"We're really looking for people who want to get an education about the entire business,\" Lang said.\n\nThe founders hope talented students who are college age, or even in their 20s or 30s, will apply. Metal heads, indie types and beat makers are all welcome. Everyone will learn how to play two instruments a semester. Students will choose one instrument, and teachers will choose the other. The Woodstock Music Lab will not give out college degrees at first, but the founders expect students will be able to earn credits accepted by colleges and universities.\n\n## Is This The Stairway To Heaven?\n\nGreen and Lang will use their connections to bring in well-known musicians to be guest professors. Some even own homes in the woods around Woodstock. Jon Anderson, former singer of the British rock band Yes, has agreed to teach at the school.\n\n\"You ever see the commercials for 'SportsCenter' with Grant Hill hanging out?\" Green asked. \"We want it to be like that.\"\n\nStudents also will see a lot of Green. He now runs the Paul Green Rock Academy. The building outside of Woodstock has a pirate flag flying out front. On a busy day of after-school lessons, Green moved from room to room acting like the Jack Black character from \"School of Rock,\" hugging and teasing students. He stuck his head into one lesson to belt out a line from the rock musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" in full ham mode: \"One of my 12 chosen will leave to betray meeee!\"\n\n## Step Aboard The Yellow Submarine\n\nRock musicians have long held mixed feelings about formal education. Still, Lang and Green see their school nurturing young artists in a way that big record companies don't do anymore.\n\nMark Mulligan is an expert on the music business. He said such a talent incubator could be useful. To be an artist today \"requires much more than being a good musician,\" he said. Bands and artists need to be skilled at marketing and social media, he added.\n\nGreen stressed that the school will concentrate on creating great art like that of the Rolling Stones and Radiohead. When Green was asked if strict school coursework might choke the spirit of rock'n'roll, he laughed.\n\n\"We're standing over the spirit of rock'n'roll with some paddles and rubbing them together,\" he said, \"and I'm yelling, 'Clear!'\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - On a Sunday in the Windy City that lived up to its nickname, Nik Wallenda walked high in the sky and lived up to his family's nickname. They are known as the Flying Wallendas, famous for their daring high-wire acts.\n\nBelow him were cheering crowds.\n\nWallenda, a tightrope walker and daredevil, made two high-wire walks and broke two world records that day, all without a safety harness or net to catch him if he fell.\n\nHis first walk took him across the Chicago River on a cable stretched between two skyscrapers. It took him 6 minutes, 51 seconds. The cable was strung at a small angle so he would be walking uphill. Wallenda set a world record for the steepest tightrope walk between two buildings.\n\n## \"Listen To That Roar\"\n\n\"You guys watching think I'm crazy, but this is what I'm made for,\" Wallenda said after stepping onto the first wire.\n\nWhile crossing the river, Wallenda was about 630 feet above the ground. That's as tall as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, or twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty. It was windy up there, but Wallenda wasn't shaken.\n\n\"It's not bad, but [the cable] is definitely moving,\" he said.\n\nEven high above the ground, Wallenda talked to the people below. Police estimated that more than 50,000 people lined the streets to watch Wallenda's stunts.\n\n\"Listen to that roar,\" he said. \"I love Chicago and Chicago definitely loves me.\"\n\n## Highest Blindfolded Walk Ever\n\nAfter successfully completing the first walk, Wallenda took an elevator down to the street, and returned to the first skyscraper for a second walk, this one blindfolded.\n\nBy crossing between two buildings blindfolded and more than 500 feet above the ground, Wallenda set another world record, for highest blindfolded walk ever.\n\nThe Discovery Channel showed Wallenda's walks live on television. Since he used no safety equipment, the channel had to make a plan in case he fell. Using a 10-second delay, the Discovery Channel planned to cut away from the live broadcast if Wallenda fell, producers said.\n\nWallenda had his own plan if he lost his balance or tripped: grab the wire and hold on. His crew can reach him in about 90 seconds anywhere on the wire.\n\nWhen he trains in Sarasota, Florida, Wallenda regularly practices falling and grabbing onto the cable. The 35-year-old married father of three says he is strong enough to hold on to the cable for 20 minutes while waiting to be rescued.\n\n## Below, At State And Wacker Streets\n\nAmong the thousands of people who turned out to watch Wallenda and cheer him on were the Ross family of Tinley Park, Illinois. Nikki and Rich Ross and their 7-year-old son Jake set up folding chairs at the intersection of State Street and Wacker Street. They ate sub sandwiches as the excitement grew around them.\n\nRich Ross said the family had seen Wallenda cross the Grand Canyon on television, but that the atmosphere in Chicago on Sunday was much more exciting.\n\n\"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience to see this firsthand instead of on TV,\" he said. \"It's incredible just to experience being down here.\"\n\nJake Ross said he was looking forward to seeing Wallenda walk blindfolded. Jake has practiced tightrope walking himself, even though he says he is afraid of heights.\n\nHis father, Rich, said he hadn't considered covering his son's eyes in case Wallenda fell. \"There are a lot of safety precautions in place. They have to have it completely safe before they let him walk,\" Ross said. \"It is a little windy, though.\"'"

            "text": "\tDUBLIN - Ireland and the U.K. are firing the first shots in Europe's latest war on tobacco. It's a battle that may end up being fought in the courtroom.\n\nLast week, Ireland became the first European country with plain packaging laws. Now cigarettes sold in Ireland will come in olive green packets with no logos. The goal is to make cigarettes seem less attractive to people who might pick up smoking.\n\nThe only pictures on the packets will show lungs that have been damaged by smoking. The boxes already have a health warning, but now it will be twice as big. It will cover 65 percent of each box.\n\nIt could take up to two years, but eventually cigarette boxes in Ireland will all look the same.\n\n## Taking The Lead In Europe\n\nIreland is following the example set by Australia, the first country in the world to outlaw traditional cigarette labels. Australia has had plain cigarette packaging since 2012, but the World Trade Organization is still looking at the laws. The WTO decides on rules for trade between countries. It might decide Australia's laws are unfair. Worries about the WTO didn't stop Ireland from passing a law like Australia's.\n\nIreland has a history of trendsetting tobacco laws. Ireland banned smoking in bars and restaurants in 2004. Then, most of Europe and the U.S. did the same. According to Bloomberg, the number of Irish adults who smoke has dropped to about 23 percent, though that's still above the average of 20 percent in countries around the world.\n\nNow the U.K. is hurrying to join Ireland and Australia in the fight against smoking. British lawmakers will vote on the plan to add a plain packaging law on Monday.\n\nThis is bad news for the tobacco business. Tobacco companies are already having a hard time right now because fewer people are smoking in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nFour of the world's biggest tobacco companies are getting ready to take the Irish government to court. They don't think they should have to change their labels. The tobacco companies have said they will fight the U.K. law as well. The court cases may decide what happens to cigarette packaging throughout Europe.\n\n## Message To Big Tobacco\n\n\"I have a message for the tobacco industry,\" said James Reilly, the government official behind the Irish laws. \"They (can come after) us, but they must understand we will win... They may have billions behind them, but we have the truth and the people on our side.\"\n\nP.J. Carroll is Ireland's oldest tobacco company. The company says the new packaging standards are against the law. The company says the Irish government would basically be taking property from companies without paying for it.\n\nJapan Tobacco Inc. calls the new standards unfair. The company says that there is no \"evidence to suggest (plain packaging) will result in public health benefits.\" Other tobacco companies are also preparing to take legal action.\n\nIf the cigarette producers win their case, they will get to go back to their old packaging. The Irish government may also have to pay tobacco companies for their court costs and the sales they lost. But plain packaging is something the whole country seems to want, so it's a risk the Ireland government is willing to take.\n\n> Update: On March 16, the U.K. passed a law to require plain cigarette packaging in England.'"

            "text": "\tThe Brontosaurus got its name back.\n\nFor more than a century, scientists thought the gigantic dinosaur might not have existed. They thought it was the same dinosaur as the Apatosaurus. But a new study has found that the Brontosaurus is really a Brontosaurus after all.\n\nThe long-necked, long-tailed sauropods were the largest animals to ever walk the Earth. The most famous of these giants is probably the Brontosaurus, the \"thunder lizard.\" The plant-eating dinosaurs lived about 154 to 150 million years ago during the Late Jurassic Period.\n\n## Game Of Bones\n\nThe first Brontosaurus was named in 1879 by Othniel Charles Marsh, a paleontologist, or scientist who studies fossils. In 1903, another paleontologist, Elmer Riggs, decided that Brontosaurus was the same dinosaur as the Apatosaurus. According to the rules of scientific naming, the oldest name wins.\n\nNow a new study says that Brontosaurus was the right name all along. Scientists found that the Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus fossils look different enough to belong to separate groups after all.\n\nFor instance, the neck of the Brontosaurus is higher and narrower than the neck of the Apatosaurus, says study author Emanuel Tschopp. He is a paleontologist at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nAlthough both are very massive animals, \"Apatosaurus is even more extreme than Brontosaurus,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers analyzed 477 different parts of 81 sauropod fossils. It took them five years and many visits to museums in Europe and the United States to look at the dinosaur bones.\n\n## Taking Another Look\n\nAt first, the scientists just wanted to understand the family tree of the diplodocids species, which is part of the sauropod family. The diplodocid dinosaurs include Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and now Brontosaurus.\n\nIn a nearly 300-page report, the scientists concluded that three known species of Brontosaurus exist. Brontosaurus excelsus was the first discovered, and the other two are Brontosaurus parvus and Brontosaurus yahnahpin. They published their findings online April 7 in the journal PeerJ, a magazine for scientists.\n\nMike Taylor teaches paleontology at the University of Bristol in England. He said the research is complete and comprehensive. He also said that the researchers were careful to make sure that other scientists could check that their results were correct.\n\nThe study \"really sets a new standard,\" Taylor said. \"I am in awe of the authors.\"\n\nTschopp said they wouldn't have been able to do the study 15 years ago. Many dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus have been found recently. These discoveries made it possible to take another look at how different the two dinosaurs actually were, he says.\n\n## \"Much More Diverse\"\n\nKenneth Carpenter is the director of paleontology at Utah State University Eastern's Prehistoric Museum. He was also impressed by the study, but said the fossil on which Apatosaurus is based has never been described in detail. He said the researchers should have described the Apatosaurus dinosaur in detail first. \"So is Brontosaurus valid after all?\" he asked. \"Maybe. But I think the verdict is still out.\"\n\nAll in all, these findings emphasize \"that sauropods were much more diverse and fascinating than we've realized,\" Taylor said. The discovery that the Brontosaurus and the Apatosaurus were two different dinosaurs is \"only the tip of the iceberg,\" he added.\n\nHe expected that many other sauropods will need to be renamed as researchers take a closer look at them.\n\n\"The Late Jurassic of North America in which they lived may have been a weird time,\" said Mathew Wedel, a paleontologist at Western University of Health Sciences in California. Many new species developed then in a harsh environment. This \"raises the question of how they could have found enough food to have supported them all.\"\n\nNow, scientists have new mysteries to solve.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Feel bad for the common Mormon swallowtail butterfly male. His possible female mates can come in four different color patterns. But only one of those patterns looks familiar. The rest look a lot like other butterflies, and poisonous ones at that.\n\nThe problem is unknown to 75 percent of the swallowtail butterfly ladies. Because they look like a poisonous butterfly, they are left alone by predators. But while masquerading as another species works just fine for them, the male and the masculine-colored female are still at risk.\n\nBiologists have studied for a long time how animals can look like other animals. This is because it teaches them a lot about the process of natural selection. Natural selection is often called \"survival of the fittest.\"\n\nIt means that animals with traits that help them will survive. A trait might be their color. It might be what they eat or how they hunt. An animal's traits can help it live longer. If it lives long enough, the animal's children can also have traits that help them survive. Eventually, the whole species might have these survival traits. Animals without these traits might get eaten or die out.\n\n## Why Just The Females?\n\nScientists have studied how animals and plants change to imitate other plants or animals. Still, mysteries remain. Why can only female swallowtail butterflies mimic other butterflies? Why can't the male butterflies?\n\nThe scientists think it might be caused by a \"super gene.\" Genes are like instructions for the body. They tell the body what an animal should look or be like. They can tell what color it will be, how strong it is, how big it is and more.\n\nScientists \"just couldn't imagine that a single gene could do all this,\" said scientist Marcus R. Kronforst. They believed it has to a be group of genes working together - a super gene. Each individual gene, they figured, was handling a small part of the color pattern.\n\nResearchers have found evidence of such a super gene in one butterfly species. So Kronforst looked for the super gene of the Mormon swallowtail. To find it, he mated butterflies with different wing patterns. Then, he studied the genes of some 500 of their offspring.\n\nHe said they expected to find a bunch of genes that pooled together to make up a \"super gene.\" Instead, they found just one gene.\n\nThe gene they found is responsible for making the females able to change patterns, but it has nothing to do with whether the butterfly will be a female or male.\n\n## Pairing Harmful And Helpful\n\nOther broad questions remain. \"If mimicry is helping these females survive, why on Earth aren't the males getting the same advantage?\" Kronforst said. \"We simply do not understand the answer to that question.\"\n\nAnd how does the non-mimicking female pattern stay alive? \"If she really was that bad off, that copy of the gene would simply disappear from the population,\" Kronforst said. The butterflies that imitated other butterflies would do so much better that the one that could not imitates others would just disappear. \"But that pattern hangs on,\" Kronforst said.\n\nHe believes that what is called \"counterbalancing selection\" may be at play. Sometimes if a harmful characteristic is paired with a helpful one, both are kept.\n\nKronforst wants to find out how the gene acts in other animals that have the same male-female differences as the Mormon swallowtail. What other changes might it drive? Does it change flight patterns as well?\n\n\"It's possible that this gene is doing lots of other stuff,\" Kronforst said.'"

            "text": "\tLAKE TAHOE, Calif. - On April 1, California Governor Jerry Brown stood on a patch of brown grass in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The ground there should be covered with a few feet of snow at this time of year.\n\nBrown watched as state officials checked the historically low levels of snow in the area. Then he announced new rules about using water. California has never had water rules like these before.\n\nBrown told the State Water Resources Control Board that they must put rules in place to make sure everyone uses 25 percent less water. That means California will save 1.5 million acre-feet of water over the next nine months.\n\n## Fighting The Drought\n\nOther parts of Brown's plan include:\n\n-Making sure golf courses, cemeteries and other grassy areas use less water.\n\n-Helping cities replace grass with rocks or plants that won't use as much water.\n\n-Rewarding customers who buy dishwashers and washing machines that use less water.\n\n-Making sure new homes use smart lawn care systems.\n\n-Making sure city workers don't water the grassy areas between traffic lanes that are just for decoration.\n\n-Making water more expensive so people won't waste it.\n\nFrank Gehrke has been part of California's snow survey program since 1987. He said there is always snow on the ground on April 1.\n\nGehrke said California is setting a record for having so little snow on the ground. That's bad news because California is already in a drought. California has gone for a long time with very little rain - and this time is usually the rainiest part of the year.\n\n## A Shrinking Snowpack\n\nCalifornia's \"snowpack\" measurements are usually highest on April 1. Some of the snow is packed almost as tight as ice and other snow is loose and fluffy. That is why the scientists don't measure how many inches of snow is on the ground. They melt it down to see how much water it makes. The water from this year's snow is only about 5 percent of the usual amount.\n\nWhen the snowpack melts, the puddles soak down into the ground or they flow into streams and rivers. The melted snowpack usually makes up almost a third of California's water supply.\n\nWater reservoirs are places where extra water is stored. Recent rainfall has raised water levels in California's reservoirs. Officials from the Department of Water say it's still not enough. They say California needs water from melted snow.\n\nDepartment spokesman Doug Carlson said his team has never observed anything like this before. He said he would usually see 60 inches of snow on the ground at one of the snowpack measuring spots on April 1.\n\nCarlson said he thinks that California will need to use groundwater, which is water located below the earth's surface. Carlson warned that there are also problems with using groundwater. He says California has already used too much of it.\n\n## Recent Rain Has Helped\n\nOfficials said the low snowfall is due to low rainfall and warm weather. The Department of Water Resources said that the northern Sierra only has 76 percent of the rain it usually gets. According to the National Weather Service, temperatures in the area have been higher than normal for the past 15 months.\n\nFortunately, the rest of the state's water situation isn't quite as bad as the snowpack.\n\nThe weather was warm when recent storms hit California and they brought in rain rather than snow. Now California's rain levels are lower than average but still better than they were last year. The northern Sierra stations have already gotten more rain in the past six months than they did for the entire year before that.\n\nThe rain has helped refill the state's reservoirs. Still, it hasn't been enough to make the State Water Resources Control Board feel comfortable about water levels. As Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus described it, the state of California's snowpack is \"just terrifying.\"\n\nThe board recently put together an emergency plan. It has stricter rules about using water during the drought. Officials told cities to limit the number of days people can water their yards. The board also warned that it will make the rules tougher if they don't see improvements soon.\n\n## \"Ringing The Alarm Bells\"\n\nSo far, Marcus said the board hasn't seen enough \"stepping up and ringing the alarm bells.\"\n\nGovernor Brown agrees that things need to change. He and other officials have created new plans in response to the drought. Last week, the governor signed a $1 billion plan into law.\n\nMost of the money will go to big projects that will take a long time to complete, like recycling sewage water and improving treatment plants. The plan also includes $127.8 million to help make changes right away. That money will buy food and water supplies. It will also protect California's environment from the effects of the drought.'"

            "title": "A nuclear disaster chased away humans, but wildlife has thrived",
            "text": "\tTom Hinton had never heard the sound before. Wolf howls, long and loud, seemed to come from every direction in the darkness. Awe and fear crept down Hinton's spine.\n\nMost humans haven't experienced this in tens of thousands of years, he said.\n\nHumans have not lived in the remote area along the Belarus-Ukraine border for many years.\n\nThey all left after a very different sound nearly 30 years earlier: the massive explosion of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986. It killed dozens and drove more than 100,000 people from their homes. These days, abandoned apartment buildings are wrecks. Vines crawl up the crumbling walls of old farmhouses and break open skylights into their roofs. No one lives there.\n\n## Wildlife Populations Are Flourishing\n\nNot humans, that is. Wildlife populations - shaggy-haired wild boar, long-legged elk, howling wolves - are flourishing according to a study published this week in the journal Current Biology. It found that mammal numbers in the no man's land are as high, if not higher, than in even the most protected wildlife parks in Belarus.\n\n\"What's surprising here was the life was able to increase even in an area that is among the most radioactively contaminated in the world,\" said Hinton. He studies how radiation affects plants and animals, and he co-authored the study.\n\n\"It shows ... how much damage we do,\" said another co-author, Jim Smith. He is an environmental science professor at the University of Portsmouth.\n\n\"Not that radiation isn't bad,\" he added, \"but what people do when they're there is so much worse.\"\n\n## When People Left, Number Of Animals Increased\n\nThe study is the first real count of wild animals in the exclusion zone. It is the area around the reactor where humans cannot live.\n\nAnimal numbers were low when scientists first started counting them in 1987. But they rapidly rose once humans left the region. Brown bears and rare European lynx - cats the size of a Great Dane - quickly appeared in the forests, even though they hadn't been seen for decades before the accident. Wild boar began living in abandoned buildings. Trees grew in the villages' empty streets.\n\nWithin 10 years, every animal population in the exclusion zone had at least doubled. At the same time, the same species were vanishing from other parts of the former Soviet Union. Their disappearance was likely caused by increased hunting, poorer wildlife management and other changes.\n\n## Radiation Hasn't Reduced Animal Numbers\n\nBy 2010, the last year of the census, the numbers of most animal species were as large as in any of Belarus' four national parks. For one species, the wolves, the population was seven times bigger.\n\nThis shows researchers that long-term exposure to radiation has had no effect on the animal populations.\n\nThis doesn't mean the zone isn't dangerous, Hinton stressed. While whole populations aren't dying out, individual animals might be getting sick. Also the soil in areas close to the nuclear reactor site is still poisonous.\n\n## Wolves Are An Indicator Of How Well An Ecosystem Is Doing\n\nThe presence of wolves is particularly important. They are a sign of the health of the entire ecosystem. If they're flourishing, that means that every other level of species, from elk and deer on down to insects and plants, must also be healthy.\n\nAnother team of researchers is counting wildlife on the Ukrainian side of the exclusion zone, where no one is allowed to live.\n\nOne of the scientists, Nick Beresford, praised the study and its findings. \"People have said before that wildlife in the zone is flourishing,\" but there was no proof, he said. \"This is the first study to really back it up with science.\"\n\nWalking around the exclusion zone is like being in \"a national park without the people,\" Hinton said.\n\n## \"A Forest With Some Buildings In It\"\n\nEven the Soviet city of Pripyat in Ukraine, which once housed tens of thousands of workers at the Chernobyl plant, has been taken over by trees.\n\n\"When I was there 15 years ago, it looked like a city with some trees growing in it,\" recalled Smith. \"Now it looks like a forest with some buildings in it.\"\n\nFor Hinton, it is both amazing and sobering.\n\n\"It's an amazing experience from a wildlife perspective,\" he said. \"It's sad to see the houses and the cars and the baseball bats, and you envision the life that people had to drop and leave. But you also see wild boar running around, and you don't see that as soon as you leave the zone.\"'"

            "title": "China says ivory sales will stop \u2001Ethe question is when",
            "text": "\tBEIJING, China - China has promised to stop selling ivory - it just has not said when it will actually do it.\n\nStill, this change could be a major victory in the battle to stop elephant poachers.\n\nTop Chinese wildlife official Meng Xianlin said his country was still deciding when and how to take action. Meng pointed out that China is not the only one that needs to make changes. He said countries like the United States need tougher regulations, too.\n\n\"Some people say, 'China should take the leadership, you first, you stop everything and other countries will follow,'\" he said. Meng believes a long-term solution will require more cooperation between countries. It will not happen overnight.\n\nMeng's announcement is a major change for China. Selling ivory is against the law in many parts of the world, but not in China. Wildlife experts say that making it illegal to sell ivory in China is the best way to stop poachers from killing elephants to get their tusks. If China stops selling ivory, it will be harder for poachers to find people to buy their ivory.\n\n## Chinese Government Praised By Several Groups\n\nThere is no way for customers to know whether elephants were killed to get the ivory they are buying. Poached ivory can still wind up in China's legal ivory stores. That means shoppers' money might go to poachers without them knowing it.\n\nMost of China's ivory was imported in 2009. Last month, China destroyed nearly 1,500 pounds of poached ivory in a public ceremony. Chinese government official Zhao Shucong announced that China would start keeping a closer eye on its ivory trade. Zhao said that, eventually, China would completely stop selling ivory products.\n\nWildlife experts were surprised to hear Zhao's announcement. Several groups praised the Chinese government for its leadership. They say ending the legal ivory trade in China will make it much easier to stop illegal activity.\n\n## But Some Wonder If Chinese Are Serious\n\nOther groups weren't so quick to celebrate. Some people wondered whether China was serious about shutting down its network of carving workshops.\n\nThe government used to say that ivory carving was an important part of Chinese history. Some say it is hard to believe the government has changed its mind about that. They think it might just keep selling ivory to workshops until its supply is gone.\n\nCristian Samper is president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. He said Meng's remarks should be a warning to poachers all over the world.\n\nNow that China has made up its mind about ivory trading, Samper says the government needs to make a plan. It needs to figure out how to make sure ivory trading stops. Samper also says people should stop buying ivory. That way, poachers won't have a reason to kill elephants.\n\nThe Chinese government bought 62 tons of ivory from Africa in 2008. Then China imported it in 2009. At the time, elephant numbers were relatively strong. Since then, China has sold smaller amounts of its ivory to more than 30 licensed carving workshops.\n\nMeng said the Chinese government sells five tons of ivory a year to carving workshops but would \"gradually\" reduce that amount to zero. China won't say how much ivory it still has left.\n\n## Elephant Population Is Declining\n\nMeanwhile, the African elephant population has been cut in half over the past 16 years. More than 40,000 animals have been killed for their tusks in just the past two years.\n\nMeng said attitudes towards animal conservation are changing throughout China, particularly among young people. Fewer people want to eat shark-fin soup because it is made from an endangered animal. Rhinoceros horn was once a popular Chinese medicine. It was banned in 1993 and now it is hard to find.\n\nMeng's speech said China should not be the only country to take action.\n\nThe United States is the world's second-largest market for illegal wildlife products. People in the U.S. are still allowed to buy and sell ivory harvested before 1989. That was the year a worldwide ban went into effect. Hunters can also bring ivory into the United States as long as they do not sell it.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama said the U.S. needed tougher rules for ivory trading. New York and New Jersey both passed laws outlawing it, but the U.S. has not completely banned it.\n\nPeter LaFontaine works for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. LaFontaine believes the United States must lead by example. He says China's announcement \"puts the ball back in our court.\n\n\"It's up to us to change the laws - and actually enforce them - before it's too late.\"'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - The Chinese breathe in some of the dirtiest air in the world. People have developed a new tool to help them fight air pollution, also called smog. The tool is a computer app.\n\nThe app shows a map of northeastern China covered with large orange circles. Each circle represents one of China's worst polluters. The app reports the amount of pollution each factory releases into the air as it happens.\n\nThe information comes from monitoring equipment at about 10,000 factories around the country. The app makes the information available to millions of Chinese on their computers, tablets and cellphones.\n\n## Smoggy Skies\n\nThe goal is to get people to pressure the government to force polluters to stop.\n\nAir pollution in China is among the worst in the world. Pollution covers China's cities in dirty clouds and makes Chinese factories one of the leading causes of global warming. Global warming is the heating up of the Earth caused by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.\n\nChina has many laws against pollution, said Ma Jun, one of China's best-known environmentalists. He works for the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, which created the app. However, the government does not force companies to follow the anti-pollution laws. Companies don't want to cut pollution because it would cost them money.\n\nMany of the worst polluters are companies owned by China's government. Others have close ties to Chinese government officials.\n\n## Public Pressure Needed\n\nChina is not a democracy. There are no elections, and courts are controlled by the government. In a democracy, elections and courts help people influence their government to make changes. In China, lots of people must pressure the government to make changes. Showing pollution on the app can encourage people to pressure officials to crack down on polluters, Ma said.\n\nOver the past several months, the app has been downloaded about 10,000 times.\n\nWhether the app will be enough to stop polluters is not known. However, people in China are becoming more worried about pollution.\n\nFive years ago, a polling company asked the Chinese people to rank their concerns. The environment ranked pretty low then, said Victor Yuan, who owns the polling company. Now, pollution is among the top problems the Chinese worry about.\n\n## More Smog, Shorter Lives\n\nA study published last year by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences showed that air pollution cuts short the lives of people in northern China by 5 1/2 years.\n\nAnother study estimated that in 2012, burning coal led to 670,000 early deaths in China. The early deaths were caused by diseases such as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. Even places as far away as California are affected by Chinese pollution, which blows across the Pacific Ocean. On some days, it makes up about one-quarter of the pollution in the California air.\n\nAfter years of trying to hide information about pollution, China's government now admits there's a problem. Until 2012, cities could not reveal the levels of a type of pollution that causes the most damage to human lungs, Ma said. Now, 190 cities do.\n\nThe goal of Ma's app is to let people know about pollution, so they'll complain about it and put pressure on the government.\n\n## Turning Gray Skies Blue?\n\nIt may be working. So far, about 200 major polluters have spoken to him about their cleanup plans.\n\nChina has promised to cut pollution over 15 years. The cleanup will be hugely expensive. Right now, coal provides about 70 percent of China's energy. It is also responsible for at least half of its pollution, said Alvin Lin, who works for an environmental group in Beijing.\n\nChina will have to stop using as much coal for electricity to cut its pollution. Officials say China also must close down its oldest and dirtiest factories.\n\nIt can be done, Ma said. He pointed to the blue skies at a recent meeting of world leaders in Beijing as proof of what can be achieved. The Chinese government took enormous steps to clear the air. It shut down polluting factories. It also reduced traffic, so fewer cars burned gas. The results showed \"you don't need 30 years\" to clear the air, Ma said. China just needs the desire to tackle the job, he said.'"

            "text": "\tSANTA CRUZ, Calif. - Surfing first came to California in 1885. Three Hawaiian princes introduced the sport to Santa Cruz by riding simple boards made from California redwoods.\n\nSurfing has changed a lot since then. Today, surfers check satellite weather forecasts on their cellphones before heading out to catch waves. The biggest change to California surfing, though, may not be the surfers. It just might be the waves.\n\nGlobal climate change is threatening many of the best surfing spots worldwide, as the Earth heats up and storms change. Monterey Bay in California has been a famous surfing area for a long time. The forecast for the future is not clear, but it does not look good.\n\n\"It definitely worries me,\" big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt said. He has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather patterns during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.\n\n## Climate Calculations\n\nA wave that a surfer rides is usually created far out in the ocean. Storms far from shore send swells, or sets of waves, toward the California coast. By the year 2100, these storms could shift. The swells might move parallel to the coast instead of toward it.\n\nDifferent swells and higher sea levels could wipe out many of today's favorite surfing spots.\n\nTo make these predictions, scientists made global climate models, using computers and calculations. The scientists look at past conditions, current trends and expected greenhouse gas levels in the future, caused by burning gas, oil and coal.\n\nScientists recently used the models to study how a warmer world might affect waves, said Li Erikson, a coastal engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz.\n\nThe results surprised both scientists and surfers. Both groups assumed a warmer and stormier future might push more waves toward the coast.\n\n\"I thought so, too,\" Erikson said with a laugh. She said there might be more storms, but storms over land may not create higher waves along the coast.\n\n## Rising Sea Levels Not Good For Surfing\n\nGood surfing conditions, such as large, well-shaped waves, depend on many different things. Swells form in the deep ocean, and as they get closer to the coast they are affected by local winds and storms. The swells must be sent in just the right direction to create perfect waves. Climate change may upset this balance.\n\n\"We'll roll with it,\" said Pete Ogilvie, a Monterey Bay surfer for more than 30 years. He is facing the possible changes with a laid-back Surf City vibe.\n\nClimate change may affect waves in several ways. A warmer ocean will melt polar ice caps. Sea levels along the Northern California coast could rise between 1 1/2 and 6 feet by the end of the century. Higher sea levels will change how waves break along the coast.\n\nAs sea levels rise, waves will not break \"in the same spots that they used to,\" said Curt Storlazzi, a geologist and oceanographer with the USGS in Santa Cruz. \"They're going to break much closer to shore.\"\n\n## Surfers On The Lookout\n\nJohn Dee has been surfing in and around the bay for 20 years. He is concerned about losing the area's low-tide surf spots - where the waves are best when water levels are low.\n\n\"If there's a 3-foot tide, everyone's out here,\" he said recently as he headed out to surf. \"If there's a 5-foot tide, nobody's out here.\"\n\nClimate models do predict larger storms and bigger waves in the oceans. But that may not benefit California's surfers. The North Pacific Swell, which creates many surfing waves today, is expected to shift.\n\n\"As the temperature rises, especially in the Arctic, the big winter storms are moving farther north,\" Storlazzi said. So, areas along California could see fewer waves.\n\n## Move The Surfboard To A New Spot\n\nThere is also an unpredictable weather pattern that could change wave patterns. It's called El Ni\\xc3\\xb1o.\n\nEl Ni\\xc3\\xb1o brings warm and high waters to the Pacific coast. Those conditions create strong storms that drive waves and winds directly into California's coast. That could improve surf conditions around Monterey Bay, at least for awhile.\n\n\"(The El Ni\\xc3\\xb1o waves) hammer the shoreline,\" Storlazzi said. \"They're the biggest and best waves.\"\n\nMonterey Bay could end the 21st century with poor surfing waves if the predictions are correct. Still, the changing climate and rising seas could create better surfing conditions in other places along the California coastline. It is impossible to say where.\n\nThe uncertain future may leave some surfers looking for answers. But others are taking a different view.\n\n\"When waves die in one spot and pick up in another, you move to that spot,\" Ogilvie said.'"

            "text": "\tThe Cuban crocodile was already considered to be one of the world's most endangered crocodiles. Now it is at even greater risk of disappearing than scientists had previously realized.\n\nThe problem is that the Cuban crocodile has been mating with its American cousin.\n\nIt seems the island's native species has been doing quite a bit of interbreeding with the more common American crocodile. Over time, its offspring are becoming less and less \"Cuban.\"\n\n## Gene Pool Is Not As Deep\n\nScientists consider the Cuban and the American crocodile to be separate species because each has its own set of genes. Genes can be thought of as instructions that are passed down from parent to child. They are unique. They shape how living things look and behave. In humans, for example, there is a gene for red hair. In Cuban crocodiles, there are genes that make them what they are. A species' complete set of genes is known as a genome.\n\nAs Cuban crocodiles mate with American crocodiles, the Cuban crocodile genome is becoming more mixed. In each baby, a portion of the Cuban crocodile genome is replaced by American crocodile genes. With each new generation, more and more Cuban genes are lost. Eventually, the species could disappear.\n\nScientists already knew the two species were mating with one another in the wild. However, they only recently discovered just how frequently this was happening.\n\n## Wild Crocs Tell The Story\n\nA team of researchers led by Yoamel Mili\\xc3\\xa1n-Garc\\xc3\\xada studied genes found in the scales of 227 wild crocodiles. They found that the level of interbreeding is much higher than previously believed: 49 percent of the wild crocodiles sampled had mixed genes.\n\nThe Cuban crocodile was once found throughout the island of Cuba. However, over-hunting starting in the mid-1800s caused its population to drop. Today there are only about 4,000 Cuban crocodiles left.\n\nNow the Cuban crocodile is at risk of losing what makes it distinct. Its genome may become so \"American\" that it will not be a separate species anymore.\n\nScientists say the Cuban crocodile is special and worth protecting.\n\nMili\\xc3\\xa1n-Garc\\xc3\\xada is trying to determine what causes the interbreeding. He suspects that hunting and the disappearance of swamps and marshes is driving both species into the same areas. Once living side by side, the two types of crocodile are much more likely to interbreed.\n\n## Captive Crocodiles Offer Hope\n\nIn addition to the wild crocodiles, Mili\\xc3\\xa1n-Garc\\xc3\\xada's team also studied 137 captive Cuban crocodiles. The animals live at the Zapata Swamp Captive Breeding Farm. Since 1974, Cuban crocodiles at the farm have been kept apart from American crocodiles. A study of their genes gave scientists some reason for hope.\n\nAround 30 percent still had certain Cuban crocodile genes that were not found in other crocodiles. In the future, those animals could be used to help keep the Cuban crocodile from disappearing.'"

            "text": "\tIt's no surprise that dogs like being petted. Unlike other animals, like porcupines, dogs are a hands-on species that loves physical contact.\n\nBut research suggests that dogs aren't the only ones who benefit from the petting. Positive interactions between people and dogs actually make both species happier. After enjoyable activities, like petting, play or talking, both dogs and humans feel a surge of chemicals in their bodies. The chemicals are called endorphins. The endorphins lead to bonding and happy feelings.\n\nA recent study shows that eye contact may be enough to increase our endorphins. Dogs pay close attention to human faces. In some cases, they can even pick up on specific facial expressions. The act of gazing at your dog - or your dog gazing back at you - has been shown to increase endorphin levels.\n\n## Sharing A Long Gaze\n\nThe new study was conducted by Miho Nagasawa, of Azabu University in Japan, and her team of scientists. They looked at the levels of certain endorphins in humans and dogs before and after the two species stared at each other. They found that owners and dogs that shared a long gaze had higher levels of oxytocin in their urine. Oxytocin is an endorphin. It is sometimes called the \"cuddle hormone\" because it has an important job in human bonding. A mother's body releases oxytocin after she has a baby. It helps her feel attached to her newborn baby. Gazing between dogs and owners is another behavior that leads to feeling attached.\n\nThe researchers collected urine samples from 30 dog-and owner pairs before and after they spent 30 minutes together. They found that the longer the dog and human stared at each other, the higher the endorphin levels were in both species. In other words, the longer the dog and human stared at each other, the more connected they felt.\n\nThese findings may help explain our intense and deep relationship with dogs.\n\nNagasawa recommends that dog owners do more than give commands to their dogs. She encourages humans to think about the effects of their gaze when they are building a relationship with their pet.\n\n## Does It Work With Wolves?\n\nNagasawa's study fits into a larger puzzle that many scientists are studying related to evolution. Coevolution is a theory that two species evolved over time in ways that are related to one another. The gazing study supports the idea that there is a connection between humans and dogs that goes back a long time.\n\nNagasawa wanted to understand if there was a similar connection between humans and other animals. So her team also conducted a gazing experiment with wolves. The wolves in the study had been raised by humans. They wanted to see if wolves would experience the same rush of endorphins that dogs did. However, there was a major difference between the dogs and wolves. The wolves couldn't hold gazes with the humans in the study for more than a few moments. The researchers concluded that the \"dog-to-owner gaze\" developed over time as humans domesticated them. Since wolves do not typically interact with humans, they did not develop that skill.\n\nTesting evolutionary theories like coevolution can be tricky. Scientists have to be careful to determine what animal behaviors are due to evolution, and which ones are because of how an animal was raised.\n\nIt is important to understand the differences in animals when scientists are making conclusions about evolution. For example, in the studies with the wolves, researchers had to think through many questions about the setting and wolves' behavior. In the gazing study, were the wolves exploring a new environment where the testing took place? Were they trying to escape? If so, those reasons may help explain why the wolves were not staring at the humans.\n\nSo far, science has supported what many people feel about dogs: there is a deep bond between a dog and its owner. However, it is too early to rule out other species, including wolves, from sharing similar connections to humans.'"

            "text": "\tSACRAMENTO, Calif. - California's capital city has hot, dry summers and gets little annual rainfall. Yet, the city's lawns are supposed to look like lush lawns in rain-soaked England.\n\nSacramento has a long history of green lawns. That may be starting to change, however. With a lack of rainfall, local governments are worried about having too little water. California is in a drought. In January, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency because of it.\n\nSo cities in California are nudging home builders to replace grass with low-water plants that more naturally suit California.\n\nA growing number of cities are even paying homeowners to tear out their lawns.\n\n## Beauty And Benefits\n\nAnd a few home builders are planning housing projects with less grass. Instead, they'll put in plants that make more sense for California's regular droughts.\n\n\"We're on the cusp of change,\" said Kevin Carson. He is a boss at The New Home Co., a company that builds large groups of homes, called developments.\n\nThe developer is building the first major housing development in decades in the town of Davis, Calif.\n\nCity officials in Davis insisted on the plan. The project will feature drought-tolerant plants along its bike paths. Most front yards will be landscaped with low-water plants in place of grass. They're planning gardens of lavender, wild roses and brush, Carson said.\n\nA big unknown is whether buyers will want homes without lawns. Carson and others said it's a matter of showing homeowners the beauty and benefits of low-water plants.\n\n\"We have to give them some different opportunities,\" Carson said.\n\nToday, there's basically one way most people think of to landscape a house: a lawn surrounded by shrubs and flowers with a shade tree or two. It's known as the English garden and now it's nearly everywhere. But that wasn't always the case, experts said.\n\nThe lawn took hold in the mid-1800s. Seed companies sold the idea to homeowners, said Thomas J. Mickey, author of \"America's Romance with the English Garden.\"\n\n\"Seed companies had a huge influence on California landscapes,\" he said.\n\n## The Perfect Lawn\n\nSalesmen went west to promote yards and sell grass seeds, Mickey said.\n\nPeople moving from the East Coast also brought their ideas of landscaping with them to the West. The emerging middle class wanted lawns just like the upper class.\n\nA well-groomed front lawn became a symbol of wealth.\n\n\"It really took off when people had the money to move to the suburbs,\" Mickey said. \"Real estate agents would say, 'Now you can have a lawn.'\"\n\nThe federal government, too, promoted lawns to homeowners. In its yearbook from 1897, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) described the ideal turf.\n\n\"A perfect lawn consists of the growth of a single variety of grass with a smooth, even surface,\" wrote the USDA.\n\nHomeowners took the advice to heart, competing to have the perfect lawn. Today they spend billions of dollars on their lawns.\n\nCities throughout California now require homeowners to cut water use by 20 percent or more.\n\nCalifornia's towns and cities are also exploring alternatives to encourage fewer lawns. For instance, Sacramento started a program that pays people to switch from grass to plants that use less water.\n\n## Saving On Water\n\nRoseville, Calif., launched its own cash-for-grass program in 2008.\n\n\"We had a line outside the door the morning we started,\" said Lisa Brown, who runs Roseville's water-conservation program.\n\nThe program pays homeowners to replace lawns with drought-tolerant plants.\n\nAn average size lawn needs 45,653 gallons of water per year, Brown estimated. The same size area needs only 12,338 gallons of water a year if it has low-water plants, she said.\n\nSince the program began, at least 500 homeowners have signed up. The change saves an estimated 14 million gallons of water annually, Brown said.\n\nBritta Kalinowski joined the program in 2009. Her front yard was once flat turf, but now it's a mix of rosemary and lavender, periwinkle and crape myrtle, with a variety of height and color.\n\nInstead of mowing once a week she trims her plants a couple of times a year and sometimes replaces a plant or two, Kalinowski said.\n\n\"I'm really happy with it,\" she said. \"It looks more interesting. Some of our neighbors are ripping their hair out because they can't keep their lawns green. They water and they fertilize. I don't have that trouble.\"'"

            "text": "\tA new study is good news for researchers testing Ebola vaccines.\n\nIt shows that the deadly Ebola virus is changing more slowly than scientists thought.\n\nA team of scientists discovered that the virus is not mutating especially quickly. As a virus mutates, its structure changes. Sometimes, this makes viruses become better and quicker killers and makes it harder for people to fight them off. An earlier study suggested the Ebola virus might be changing twice as fast as in previous outbreaks. The new findings published in Science magazine show that the earlier study seems to be wrong.\n\n## The Virus Has Not Changed Much\n\nUnderstanding the virus's mutation rate is important. Researchers must develop vaccines against Ebola as it is now. If the virus would dramatically change, the vaccines likely would not work.\n\nThe Ebola virus has killed more than 10,000 people in the past year in West Africa. For the new study, researchers analyzed DNA from several outbreaks of Ebola. DNA holds the information that tells your body how to grow and function and is passed on from parents to children.\n\nThe researchers compared the DNA of Ebola samples collected in Guinea in March 2014 with Ebola samples from Sierra Leone collected in June. They also compared those samples to newer Ebola samples from Mali collected last fall. The researchers were looking to see if there were differences among the samples.\n\nThis new snapshot of Ebola showed that there were surprisingly few differences. The changes mostly appeared to be minor. In fact, the researchers calculated that there was little change in the mutation rate between Ebola now and in earlier outbreaks.\n\n## Positive Vaccine Tests On Monkeys\n\nThe new study tracked changes in Ebola over a longer period than ever. This gives a fuller picture of the virus and its changes, said Heinz Feldmann, the main author of the study. He is a virus expert at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\n\nThe study means that it's \"less likely than we thought that vaccines and treatment options will fail,\" Feldman said. Still, it may not be the final word. More samples of the virus taken in 2015 from other places in West Africa will give scientists a clearer picture, he said.\n\nThe results are much-needed good news in the fight against the deadly virus.\n\nCurrently, there is no proven vaccine to prevent Ebola. But several possible vaccines are being tested on people.\n\nRecently, a vaccine was successful at preventing the disease in macaque monkeys. The monkeys often stand in for humans as test subjects.\n\n\"Findings in nonhuman primates are always significant,\" says Thomas Geisbert. He studies viruses at the University of Texas. Geisbert said the experts still have to see how the vaccine compares with others being tested in humans.\n\n\"The availability of a good and safe vaccine would make an immense difference. We are going to see future outbreaks of Ebola,\" said Keiji Fukuda. He is with the World Health Organization (WHO). Even if one drug is successful against Ebola, he said, researchers should continue to develop other drugs.\n\n## Stronger Health Systems Are Necessary\n\nMeanwhile, experts are starting to think about how to combat future outbreaks of Ebola.\n\nVictor Dzau is the president of the Institute of Medicine. The organization is bringing together a group of 15 experts. Their mission is to figure out the best way to use international aid money and create strong health systems.\n\nTheir conclusions will be especially important. During the current Ebola outbreak, the international community took months to organize the response. It took months to send doctors and set up hospitals, and countries did not send enough money.\n\n## Fewer Sick People\n\nThe number of Ebola cases has definitely slowed in West Africa. In total, 79 new cases of Ebola were reported to the WHO for the week of March 22. It was the lowest number of cases for a week in 2015 so far. Health experts are looking toward the day that Ebola will be gone from West Africa. Yet people in Sierra Leone and Guinea are still coming down with the disease.\n\nIn Liberia, which came close to being declared Ebola-free, a new case of Ebola was discovered last week.\n\nAs Ebola slows, the international health-care community may move on to other problems. Fukuda said he is  terrified that Ebola will disappear from people's memories. He said that would be tragic.'"

            "title": "25 years later, Exxon Valdez oil spill lingers",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Andy Wills was laying on a friend's couch in Cordova, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. He was up early, ready to head out and fish for herring in Prince William Sound.\n\n\"My buddy had just handed me a cup of coffee in the morning and we're watching 'Good Morning America,'\" Wills said. \"And there's the Exxon Valdez on TV, spilling oil.\"\n\nHe added, \"We were like, 'No!' It was just the start of a nightmare.\"\n\nThe herring of Prince William Sound still have not recovered. Neither have killer whales, and legal issues remain unresolved a quarter of a century later. Monday marked the day when the disaster struck, 25 years ago. On that day, the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef and spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into the waters of the sound. At the time, it was the nation's largest oil spill.\n\n## Recovery Open To Debate\n\nPrince William Sound today looks breathtaking. It's a stunning setting of cliffs, blue-green waters and thickly forested islands. Pick up a stone on a rocky beach, maybe dig a little, though, and it is possible to still find pockets of oil.\n\n\"I think the big surprise for all of us who have worked on this thing for the last 25 years has been the continued presence of relatively fresh oil,\" said Gary Shigenaka. He's a marine scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe question of how well Prince William Sound has recovered is open to debate. Exxon Mobil Corp. says studies show the area is bouncing back. Exxon Mobil is the company that was shipping oil inside the Valdez.\n\nThe area where the spill happened is doing very well and there has been \"a very solid, complete recovery,\" said Richard Keil, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.\n\nGovernment scientists have a different view.\n\nThe Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council is a group set up to make sure the Prince William Sound returns to its normal environment. It considers the numbers of pink and sockeye salmon to be back to normal. Bald eagles and harbor seals have also bounced back. Several other species are listed as recovering but not recovered.\n\n## \"People Got Real Hurt\"\n\nSea otters have had a rough time. Thousands died in the months following the spill, and the population has struggled to recover in the 25 years since. The U.S. government reported earlier this month that the sea otters of the area had finally returned to their pre-spill numbers.\n\nStill not recovering are the herring, a group of killer whales and a type of seabird.\n\nWills, who fished salmon as well as herring, said the spill left a huge mark on those who made a living from Prince William Sound.\n\nExxon gave money to pay people for losses, but checks were too late and too little, he said.\n\n\"A lot of people got real hurt. I got divorced. It was rough,\" said Wills, who now runs a bookshop and cafe in Alaska.\n\nAmong the scientific puzzles of the spill, the fate of the herring is a particular mystery. It's an essential species for the ecosystem. Whales, salmon and birds all feed on it.\n\n## Herring Never Recovered\n\nPrince William Sound was home to a moneymaking spring herring fishery. It helped fishermen who were badly in need of cash in between fishing seasons.\n\nScientists found physical abnormalities in herring exposed to the oil. Then, four years after the spill, the herring population crashed dramatically. The reasons are a subject of intense debate. Suggestions have been made that the effects of the spill could have made the herring weak against disease.\n\nThe herring never really recovered, and herring fishing has been closed for most of the last 20 years.\n\nThe killer whales of Prince William Sound also have suffered. Two groups were hit especially hard. Scientists saw killer whales from one of the groups swimming through oil floating on the ocean surface. A Los Angeles Times photo showed whales from the other group swimming near the tanker as it gushed oil. Populations dropped dramatically in the year after the spill.\n\nOne of the groups continues to slowly recover. The other numbered 22 killer whales at the time of the spill and is down to just seven. Scientists now expect it to go extinct. If so, it would be the end of a whale line that has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last ice age.\n\nThe federal and state governments are still weighing the science of the spill's effects. Court cases will decide whether to seek more money from Exxon Mobil for cleaning up remaining oil.'"

            "text": "\tKANSAS CITY, Mo. - Farmers can't change the weather, of course. But perhaps now they will be able to outwit Mother Nature.\n\nNew technologies like those from a California company called Climate Corp. are combining agriculture with math formulas. They offer farmers a way to handle severe weather patterns.\n\nThese days more and more farmers are seeing crops wilt from overheating, drought and increasingly wild weather swings. Climate Corp. is among those offering help.\n\n\"We're moving into a period of very unstable weather, and that's what producers need to be prepared for,\" said Jerry Hatfield, a scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\n## Mountains Of Data\n\nScientists believe they know the cause of the crazy weather: climate change, or [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) caused by humans when they burn fuels like gas.\n\nThere are still many people who don't believe that climate change is real. And this is perhaps especially true in an industry as tradition-bound as farming.\n\nStill, scientists and farmers are increasingly planning ahead. They are trying to figure out ways to have a bountiful harvest if rain is less dependable and temperatures shift.\n\nEnter Climate Corp. Started six years ago, the company uses huge amounts of data and numbers to develop hyper-local weather forecasts.\n\nClimate Corp. produces its forecasts from weather readings at 10 million locations. These readings are matched with 40 years of national crop-yield data.\n\nThe company can provide detailed information about 29 million fields in the United States. Farmers receive field-specific forecasts for rain, soil conditions and wind speed.\n\nThe service can also give farmers a range of details about their land. For example, farmers can get information about projected yields, the amount of soil moisture and how well their crops are growing.\n\nClimate Corp. promises a new way for farmers to adjust to extreme weather. And, it adds, even farmers who can't stomach the words \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" will find it useful.\n\n\"Farmers still face a tough battle out there every year. Hopefully this helps them,\" said Climate Corp. vice president Jim Ethington. \"It's by no means a silver bullet.\"\n\n## Weather Increasingly Unpredictable\n\nBut some farmers don't just question global warming. They are also doubtful about the new forecasting methods.\n\nTed Guetterman farms about 10,000 acres with his dad and three brothers.\n\nGuetterman, 45, said he's willing to look at high-tech farming methods. Still, he thinks he's his own best judge of what needs to be done.\n\n\"Nobody knows my land better than I do,\" Guetterman said. \"I've been farming it all my life.\"\n\nGuetterman said he would take some advice from an outside company. But, he added, \"I'm not going to do my whole farm that way.\"\n\nThe emergence of farm number crunchers comes as global climate change is worsening. Rising temperatures and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are altering the outlook for the country's $300 billion agriculture industry. And they are changing the way crops are grown.\n\nA USDA report this year warned of increasing fluctuation in weather patterns and the effect on crops.\n\nAgriculture will be able to adjust to climate change in the near term, the report asserts. But in the long run, changing environmental conditions present \"unprecedented challenges.\"\n\nThose shifts will likely cause serious problems for Kansas and other Great Plains states, including Oklahoma, Nebraska and South Dakota.\n\n## Crops Yields Will Drop\n\nThe USDA estimates that wheat production across the Great Plains will drop 6 percent by 2050 because of warming temperatures. And corn yields will fall 4 percent over the same period.\n\nA study by Kansas State University researchers also points to serious problems ahead. It estimated that for every 1 degree Celsius increase in average temperature, the state's wheat yield would drop 21 percent. This translates to a loss of 10.6 bushels per acre.\n\nIt's a startling number considering that temperatures are expected to rise. Much of the middle of the country is expected to see temperatures increase by 2 to 3 degrees C in the next 40 years.\n\nFew in Kansas believe climate change is going to push wheat or corn out of the state. But it could make growing them more risky.\n\n\"The variability from year to year is going be greater than it has been in the past,\" said soil scientist Charles Rice. \"The producer is going to have to have money in the bank to pay for those poor years.\"\n\nRice and others emphasize the need for better ways to adapt. Areas of focus include better weather forecasting, new plant-breeding methods and better soil management.\n\nFor instance, scientists are looking at how to develop a type of wheat that holds up better against the warming effects of climate change.\n\nHatfield, the USDA expert, said farmers will need to adjust to climate change.\n\n\"Climate has changed, climate is changing,\" he said, \"and climate is going to change in the future.\"'"

            "title": "Florida ferns face threats to survival; fans work fervently to save them",
            "text": "\tMIAMI, Fla. - Somewhere in South Florida, an extremely rare fern is barely hanging on in the wild.\n\nThe fern was discovered in 2006 near Florida City in a location plant experts prefer not to give away. They worry that the fern - the only one of its kind growing wild in North America - could disappear forever. So two years ago, a team led by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden launched a rescue mission. Its purpose was to collect and grow fern spores, seed-like cells which can become new plants. The spores themselves are no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence.\n\n## Trying To Score With Spores\n\nThe team planted the spores and waited.\n\n\"I had a heck of a time getting spores,\" Fairchild botanist Jennifer Possley said this month, as she displayed the fern. Botanists study plants. The wispy, Caribbean maiden hair fern is about 6 inches tall. It one of about 20 now growing at the garden.\n\nThe Caribbean fern mission was successful, but a larger fern crisis is playing out across Miami-Dade County in South Florida.\n\nWith 124 native ferns, Florida has more species than anywhere else in the United States outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico, Possley said. Of those, 48 types of ferns grow in Miami-Dade County. More than half, 26, are threatened or in danger of becoming extinct. Fourteen species of fern have already disappeared.\n\n## Does Development Spell Doom?\n\nIf the surviving ferns grew in large, protected preserves like Everglades National Park, Possley would worry less. However, seven of the ferns are found only in small nature areas. The areas are now surrounded by highways, business areas and busy neighborhoods.\n\n\"This is where I come in and start to sweat,\" Possley said.\n\nNative ferns were once found all over South Florida. They had admirers who flocked to fairy-like caves, braving thorny vines and spiders, in search of rare species. Tours were even led into fern-lined sinkholes, giant holes in the ground.\n\nFern fans like her will go almost anywhere for the plant, Possley wrote in an article.\n\nLike dozens of other rare plants and creatures, wild ferns began disappearing from the wild. Buildings and roads were built over fern habitats. Collectors also nearly wiped out some species by taking the plants from the wild.\n\n## Location, Location, Location\n\nPossley says one fern can produce billions of spores. But spores can be picky about the location where they will grow. Also, ferns grow slowly, so its hard to bring them back quickly.\n\nConsider the brown-hair comb fern. First spotted in 1962, the rare fern was nearly wiped out about three years ago. Possley learned about the threat because she tracks rare plants. She and other botanic garden plant experts collected spores of the fern just before they were destroyed.\n\nThen began the time-consuming work of growing the ferns from the spores. Mike Freedman, who is with the botanic garden, spent months tending to the spores. He made a special container to improve their chances of surviving. Six weeks after the spores started growing, the ferns remained tiny. Their heart-shaped leaves could be seen only under a microscope. At three months, they measured about an inch tall, looking a little like parsley. At about a year, the ferns were finally 2 to 3 three inches tall and large enough to be put in pots. They were shipped to a greenhouse where Possley and other botanists have been growing about 300 rare plants.\n\n## Can \"Fairy Gardens\" Make A Comeback?\n\nThe garden was able to plant its greenhouse-grown ferns in the wild, and the brown-hair fern managed to hold on, Possley said.\n\nThere is another threat that increasingly puts ferns at risk. Rising sea levels blamed on climate change could alter the fern's habitat. Climate change involves the warming of the earth. Fairchild is now working to identify land where rare ferns used to grow so they can be replanted there. The garden is also sending seeds to the nation's seed bank. The National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation in Colorado stores seeds and animal tissue important to U.S. agriculture.\n\nPossley would love to see the \"little fairy gardens\" that once drew tourists replanted. Still, she recognizes the challenges.\n\n\"Now most of them are buried underneath Miami,\" she said.'"

            "title": "Heard through ear bones, tales of the fish and the ocean",
            "text": "\tSEATTLE - A tiny white sliver inside the heads of fish could hold evidence of a century's worth of humans wrecking the environment: atomic bombs, overfishing, even climate change.\n\nFish ear bones, also known as otoliths, are like tree rings for the ocean. A layer of calcium carbonate laid down each year offers a snapshot of both the fish's yearly growth and its surrounding ocean.\n\nThe University of Washington's Burke Museum has been transferring and cataloging 2 million pairs of otoliths. Scientists hope this collection will help them track the health of fish populations and the ocean itself up and down the West Coast. It represents some 80 species gathered over the past half-century.\n\nThe otolith collection had been sitting in an old Sand Point hangar. It belonged to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Ted Pietsch, a UW professor at the Burke Museum, got a grant last year to transfer the otoliths to the museum - all of a 10-minute drive away.\\n## Archived In A Museum\n\nThe reason for the not-so-far move? Fire. The thousands of flammable Styrofoam boxes, piled 20 feet high and filled with ethanol for preservation, were a huge fire hazard.\n\nThe threat of fire convinced the National Science Foundation to fund a two-year, $500,000 grant. Instead of sitting uncataloged in a hangar, the otoliths will be archived in the Burke. They can now be searched online by scientists and researchers.\n\nThe UW recently made the first loan of the otoliths to Oregon State University. Researchers there are studying the age when flatfish settle to the ocean floor. A flatfish swims on its side and has both eyes on its upper side.\n\nImportant information is held in the chemical makeup of each otolith layer. It has interested archaeologists, geochemists and fish biologists alike.\n\nFishermen were the first to benefit from the otolith information. It is used in population models that help determine catch limits each year. Fish populations are closely managed by NOAA so as not to repeat disasters such as cod overfishing on the East Coast.\n\nOtoliths reveal age. When taken together with the sex, size and capture location for many fish, they paint a portrait of the population's health. Scientists can calculate how much fishermen can catch without causing a whole species to collapse.\\n## Going To Sea To See Otoliths\n\nTrained observers go to sea with fishermen to gather information. NOAA's fishery research centers rely on scientific survey boats as well as these observers to collect otoliths.\n\n\"Each fish has its sweet spot,\" says Katherine Maslenikov, fish-collections manager at the Burke. She has dug through fish heads herself as an observer on fishing boats.\n\nThree pairs of otoliths - scientists collect only the largest pair - sit in capsules of liquid behind the fish's head. Technically, they are stones, not bones, because they contain no live cells.\n\nOtoliths are unique to each species. A pollock's are wing-shaped and about two centimeters long. Others are delicate white filigrees pretty enough for jewelry. The salmon has especially tiny and hard-to-find otoliths. This huge variation among species is what makes deciding the age of otoliths such difficult work.\n\nDetermining the age of otoliths is the specialty of Tom Helser's lab at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, a part of NOAA. His 12-person lab ages about 30,000 otoliths a year.\n\n\"Flight recorders\" is how Helser likes to describes otoliths.\\n## Recording Migration Patterns\n\nOcean temperature varies from shallow coastal waters to deeper ones, so otoliths record migration patterns in their levels of oxygen-18. Oxygen-18 is a slightly heavier version of the typical oxygen-16 atom we all know. Because it varies with temperature, the oxygen-18 level rises and falls with the seasons. Each rise and fall represents one year. A recent study in yellowfin sole found a sharp increase in oxygen-18 after the fish turned 7 years old, meaning it moved into deeper, colder waters. As juveniles, they must have lived near the coast.\n\n\"This is an animal that responds extremely closely to temperature as it grows older,\" said Helser. He noted how climate change could interfere with the fish's usual behavior.\n\nCombining growth information with temperature could also shed light on [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).\n\nOn a longer time scale, 4,000-year old otoliths in prehistoric trash heaps are a record of ancient surface-water temperatures. This is the basis of a collaboration between Helser and archeologists in Newfoundland. The chemical signature of the atomic bomb is seen in otoliths, too.\n\nSome of the otoliths in the collection date to the 1960s, and that includes rockfish, which can live more than 100 years.\n\nThe real goal in cataloging the collection is to aid this wide range of research.\\n## A Wealth Of Data\n\nOn a Thursday morning, Helser walked through the cavernous NOAA hangar counting pallets of otoliths. Next to boat parts and old office equipment are another 100 or so pallets yet to be moved to the UW. Each pallet contains up to 200 boxes. Each holds 100 pairs of otoliths when full.\n\nThe UW is about halfway through cataloging the otoliths. A team of undergraduates is deciphering the scrawled handwriting and putting otoliths in orderly, archival-quality boxes.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be overwhelming, just the number of samples,\" said senior Kali Williams. She was sorting through her umpteenth box.\n\n\"This process really highlights the value of collections,\" added Maslenikov. \"For a long time, they just kept them in boxes, and all of a sudden there's this wealth of data so many people can use. What if they'd just pitched them?\"'"

            "title": "South Florida's coral reefs recovering from disease and damage",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - South Florida's coral reefs are a natural wonder. They are huge and beautiful underwater structures made out of limestone deposited by tiny animals called coral polyps. Thousands of kinds of fish, as well as other kinds of animals and plants, call them home.\n\nAnd the reefs bring in a lot of money to the area too - as much as $6 billion - because they are popular with divers, boaters and fishermen.\n\nThe reefs were formed over thousands of years. They took shape as free-swimming coral larvae attached themselves to submerged ridges in warm, shallow waters.\n\nBut for many years all has not been well with South Florida's reefs. They have suffered serious damage and disease.\n\nNow, at last, they appear to be recovering.\n\n## Recent Study Raises Hopes\n\nIn recent years, the area's reefs have been spared from major storms and ship groundings. This has allowed them to survive and even grow offshore.\n\nA study released this month brought more good news: Coral reefs may be able to adapt to warmer sea temperatures. This is significant because [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) is making sea temperatures go up.\n\nBut, scientists said, reefs can only take a limited degree of gradual warming. Carbon emissions must be reduced to keep water temperatures from getting too high.\n\nCarbon emissions are anything that raises the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are a major type of so-called greenhouse gasses. Greenhouse gasses cause what is known as the greenhouse effect, which is making global temperatures gradually rise.\n\nStill, the study is raising hopes that Florida's reefs will survive.\n\nFlorida is a low-lying state just above sea level. And it is home to 84 percent of the nation's reefs. This makes it especially threatened by sea-level rise and global warming. It also makes it a perfect place to check on the progress of conservation.\n\n## Still, Extra Help Needed\n\n\"We haven't had a large crash in the population of corals. And we have seen some good signs that the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) - staghorn coral - continues to be abundant and may even be increasing in abundance in some places,\" said conservationist Richard Dodge. \"So that's the good news.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"The bad news is: There are still some coral diseases out there. We still worry about bleaching, which appears to be caused by warmer water temperatures. But we are lucky in South Florida to avoid a lot of hurricanes and tropical storms lately.\" Such storms, Dodge said, can cause major damage to reefs.\n\nThe reef recovery also has been helped by improved sewage systems. These prevent polluted water from seeping into the ocean. Greater public awareness has also led boaters to avoid dropping anchors on the fragile reefs. And moving ship anchorages farther offshore has prevented damaging ship groundings.\n\nPeople now realize, conservationist Chris Bergh said, that they need to take better care of coral reefs. And reefs will need extra help to get them through \"a stressful time, as the climate continues to change.\"\n\n\"We have hit bottom and are ever so slowly seeing some recovery,\" he said. \"There are a lot of big and expensive things that still need to be done, and I guess the most expensive of all is getting a handle on the root causes of climate change.\" And that essentially means, Bergh said, getting a handle on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Environmental And Economic Mission\n\nTo help restore damaged reefs, scientists are growing baby corals in indoor nurseries. Once grown, they are transplanted offshore.\n\nThe struggle to preserve reefs has turned into an economic as well as an environmental mission. This is because of their importance for recreation and tourism.\n\nStudies in 2000 and 2004 found that reefs along the southeast Florida coast generated $6 billion of economic activity. They also supported 71,000 jobs.\n\n\"It's probably a lot more than that by now,\" said diving shop owner Jeff Torode. \"Without reefs, you don't have fish. Without fish, you don't have divers, you don't have snorkelers.\" And without reefs \"you don't have something to protect those shorelines. For me to be in business, it's in my best interest to protect the coral reefs.\"\n\nReefs are a big draw to tourists and their spending money.\n\n\"There's no doubt that if we destroy those beautiful reefs, there will be some significant economic impact,\" said tourism expert Abraham Pizam. \"It's an important element that should be preserved for generations to come.\"'"

            "text": "\tFRESNO, Calif. - Mountain residents and the Fresno County sheriff are squaring off against a federal wildlife agency over frogs and toads in an Endangered Species Act fight that is spreading like wildfire along the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nPeople are reacting to proposed protection for the amphibians, fearing it will \"seal off\" land to logging, grazing and hiking, and threaten the use of foothill reservoirs. The economy will be devastated, they say.\n\nFish and Wildlife leaders say they are not proposing to shut down forests.\n\n\"We don't have the authority to do that,\" Fish and Wildlife spokesman Robert Mole said. \"The proposed critical habitat does not block growth or restrict access. We're trying to minimize or avoid impacts on the species.\"\\n## Tale Of A Frog And Toad\n\nThe species in question are two distinct groups of the mountain yellow-legged frog and the Yosemite toad. They are being killed off by widespread fungus, a loss of their habitat and the addition to the area of fish that eat the frogs and toads.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in April proposed protection under the Endangered Species Act. The proposal came after years of pressure from environmentalists.\n\nThe service also proposed designating 1.83 million acres of critical habitat for the amphibians. The areas are considered essential for the frogs and toads to survive.\n\nBut worried people in California asked for a delay so they could make more in-depth comments about the plan. Fish and Wildlife extended the period for the public to submit comments from June to Nov. 18.\n\nIn Fresno County, the mention of the protections stirred bad memories of the 1990s. The logging industry back then was hurt by U.S. Forest Service protections for such sensitive species as the California spotted owl.\n\nThe owl was not an [endangered or threatened species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). But the U.S. Forest Service plans were designed to protect large, old trees, where the owls liked to live. Logging was dramatically cut back. Most lumber mills shut down in this part of the mountain range. Some California towns were hit hard.\\n## The County Sheriff's In Town\n\nFresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said last month that she worries that the Endangered Species Act will hurt funding for law enforcement and public safety.\n\n\"What I don't want to see is any more damage to the local economy,\" she said. \"I don't want people who live 3,000 miles away dictating what we do.\"\n\nMims later said she was concerned about the added paperwork for new or expanding businesses. Fish and Wildlife leaders say they were not invited to the Prather meeting. They say there may be a misunderstanding about the 1.83 million acres that are labeled a critical habitat.\n\nThe label applies only to federal land or projects needing federal permits, spokesman Mole said. Fish and Wildlife must be consulted in those cases. The agency is routinely involved in many kinds of these projects.\n\nThe Madera Water Bank in California's San Joaquin valley is one example. That project is in the habitat for the protected blunt-nosed leopard lizard, Fresno kangaroo rat, San Joaquin Kit Fox and other protected species.\n\nTo get the project going, there were studies, added expense and requirements to set aside land for the animals.\\n## Amphibians Dying Too Fast\n\nMore than 300 species of plants and animals are under federal protection in California. That is the most animals in any state and second-most plants.\n\nEnvironmentalists and some scientists have been pushing for a decade to list the Sierra amphibians under the Endangered Species Act. The animals have been dying way too fast over the past two decades, say biologists.\n\nA government study this month revealed evidence that pesticides used in Central Valley agriculture are somehow drifting up into the Sierra and accumulating in amphibians. The chemicals add to the amphibians' stress, scientists say.\n\nBut the biggest problems are fish planted in high mountain lakes and a fungal infection, said scientist Vance Vredenburg, associate professor at San Francisco State University. The fish and the infection have wiped out millions of frogs, he said.\n\nMany amphibian species, including those in the Sierra, face extinction around the globe from similar conditions, Vredenburg said.\\n## A Link In The Food Chain\n\nThe frogs and toads are an important link in the food chain, consuming insects and providing prey for other creatures. As such, they are part of a mountain community that improves air and water quality.\n\nThe high-mountain meadows and lakes where the frogs live must be protected to give them a chance at survival, Vredenburg said.\n\n\"We need to pay attention to this,\" he said. \"Amphibians are long-term survivors. They've been around more than 300 million years.\"'"

            "text": "\tChristmas gifts from past years meet a sad end at Absolute Green Electronics Recycling in California. Computers are dismantled. Their parts get sorted into cardboard bins.\n\nOne bin holds nothing but hard drives. Another holds AC adapters. Bins stretch in rows across a huge warehouse. There are bins for cellphones, camcorders, digital cameras, cables and network switches.\n\nStacked-up printers form a miniature mountain. Old-fashioned picture tubes sit face-down on platforms. Flat-screen monitors are clustered along a wall like tombstones.\n\n\"There are different grades of boards,\" said owner and president Victor Kianipay, stepping past dust-covered TVs to poke into apple boxes filled with circuit boards.  Those boards are the guts of a computer. \"Everything gets separated,\" Kianipay said. \"There are so many layers and layers of product.\"\n\n## E-Waste A Global Problem\n\nThis is electronic waste, or e-waste.  Kianipay makes money from it. He moved 25,000 pounds of discarded items in last January's post-Christmas frenzy. But e-waste also is a global environmental problem. The rising tide of electronic junk now totals nearly 50 million tons a year worldwide, according to the Solving the E-Waste Problem Initiative, a coalition of governments, scientists and industry groups based in Bonn, Germany.\n\nWithin five years, the annual figure may reach 65 million tons, the group estimates. That is enough to fill trucks parked bumper to bumper going around three-quarters of the Earth. The waste is a particular concern. Much of it contains lead, mercury and other dangerous substances. Those substances are released when the waste is melted down to recover gold, silver and copper.\n\nA lot of companies send electronic waste to developing countries. Now there are big scrap businesses in poor parts of China and Africa. But it has also exposed large numbers of people to toxins and carcinogens. These are poisonous and can cause health problems like cancer.\n\n\"You see all these thousands - literally thousands - of women and young kids whose job is to cook circuit boards,\" said Jim Puckett. He is the founder of the Seattle-based Basel Action Network. The group is named after a Swiss city. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, international agreements were drafted there to stop the \"digital dumping.\"\n\nThirty-five nations have adopted the ideas of the Basel Convention, Puckett said. But the United States - by far the largest producer of e-waste - has not.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said \"most discarded consumer electronics end up in our landfills.\" No one is sure how much e-waste ends up being exported from the U.S., the EPA says, but \"the United States government is concerned that these exports are being mismanaged abroad, causing serious public health and environmental hazards.\"\n\n## Boosting Recycling In The U.S.\n\nPuckett has spent years investigating the issue. He estimates that \"about 50 to 80 percent of what is handed over to recyclers is exported.\"\n\nPushed by environmental activists, Congress and state governments are trying to ensure that e-waste gets properly recycled here. A proposed law was introduced in July.  It would prohibit the export of electronic junk containing toxins to nations that cannot process them safely.\n\nIn addition, President Barack Obama established a task force in 2010. Its job is to encourage development of \"greener\" electronic devices and to boost recycling in the U.S.\n\nCalifornia became a national pioneer by passing a recycling law in 2003. The law created a system offering money to prevent the disposal of most video-display devices and certain other types of electronic equipment in landfills. The law especially targets outmoded TVs and computer monitors that have cathode-ray tubes - not flat screens.\n\nThe old TVs are particularly bad. They contain both lead and mercury, said Mark Oldfield, a spokesman for the state's Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery.\n\nMore than 1.5 billion pounds of video-display equipment has been collected because of the law since 2005, Oldfield said.\n\nInside a long, cluttered warehouse at EZPC Recycle in Santa Ana, Calif., owner Chris Chun has a workbench where his staff tests discarded computers. Devices that still work are sold. Computers are offered at a steep discount to schools and churches.\n\n\"I have kids. I want them to have a clean, safe environment,\" said Chun, a father of two boys. If electronic equipment gets tossed into a dump, \"it just stays there,\" Chun said.\n\n## Shredded Then Sent To Canada\n\nStill, e-waste is never particularly easy or clean even when handled properly. Taking apart some equipment requires removing up to 50 screws, Chun said.\n\nHuge shredders turn circuit boards and hard drives into large bits of glass, metal and plastics. Those pieces then have to be melted to separate valuable metals, said Ted Smith. He is the founder of the San Francisco-based Electronics TakeBack Coalition. The melting happens in machines called smelters.\n\n\"There are no smelters that do this in the U.S.,\" due to the environmental effects of the smelting process, Smith said. Therefore, the shredding companies send the metal to a smelter in Canada.\n\nSo far, nearly half the states have passed e-waste recycling  laws. Still, environmentalists fear they are only losing ground because of the astonishing explosion of devices.\n\nConsumers upgrade their cellphones even when the old ones still work.  There are also all sorts of new products. GPS systems and Google Glass are two.\n\n\"Four hundred million gadgets a year get thrown away in this country,\" said Annie Leonard. She is the president of The Story of Stuff Project in Berkeley, Calif.'"

            "text": "\tPITTSBURGH - Many were shocked when the Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark decided it had to end the life of an 18-month-old giraffe.\n\nWorkers at the Danish zoo said they had no choice. The animal, named Marius, could harm the European giraffe population. Its genes were too much like those of other giraffes.\n\nAll plants and animals have genes. They play a big part in what animals and plants look and act like. Genes are passed down from parents. They determine eye color, hair color, athletic ability, health and more.\n\nIf an animal species' genes are too alike, it can be more likely to become sick or have certain problems. The animal species may become weaker. It might not be able to change with its environment.\n\nFor example, a disease could spread among giraffes. Giraffes that have the same genes may all end up dying of the disease. Giraffes with different genes might be able to stay alive.\n\n## Was Killing It The Only Way?\n\nMany wondered why the zoo did not take other measures to prevent the giraffe from breeding. Zoo workers could have given the animal medication to prevent it from producing offspring. Another possible choice was to transfer Marius to another zoo. The zoo released a statement on its website explaining its decision.\n\n\"In Copenhagen Zoo we let the animals breed naturally,\" said Bengt Holst in the statement. He is the zoo's scientific director. He explained that the zoo's animals breed at the same times they would in the wild. The use of medication or an operation to prevent breeding can cause painful problems, so the zoo believes it is better for the animal to be killed.\n\nAn operation could be dangerous for a giraffe, explains Joerg Jebram. He oversees the European zoo association's [endangered-species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) program for giraffes. Zookeepers would have to sedate the animal to keep it calm during an operation. Sedation makes the animal tired, which puts giraffes at risk of falling and breaking their necks.\n\nThe European zoo association said it supports Copenhagen Zoo's decision to put the giraffe down. The association said it \"believes strongly\" in protecting animal gene pools. Gene diversity is important to the giraffe population's health.\n\nMany in the United States were outraged by the giraffe's death. U.S. zoos said they would never take such action.\n\nSharon Dewar works for the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. She says Europe and the United States have different ideas about how to manage animal populations. \"We only breed animals that we are assured can be cared for and housed for the entirety of their natural life,\" she says.\n\n## \"Very Careful Planning\"\n\nThe Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) oversees more than 200 facilities in the United States. AZA looks at all animal species every one to three years. The group advises zoos on whether or not to mate the animals. The advice is based on housing availability, population size and other factors. If breeding is not advised, zoos can take other measures to protect the animals.\n\nA spokeswoman for the San Diego Zoo said putting animals down is not used to keep their numbers under control in the U.S. Its staff only considers putting an animal down it it is suffering.\n\n\"The goal is always very careful planning,\" said Christina Simmons of the San Diego Zoo. There are a number of ways to prevent breeding, she explains. Animals can be given medication or an operation. They can also be separated.\n\nSimmons said the San Diego Zoo places animals in select groups to prevent breeding. These groups are found in nature, but would not have babies. Examples include single-gender groups and groups with animals past reproductive age.\n\nDewar of Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago says that in North America accredited zoos operate under the same rules. All animal offspring are guaranteed a sustainable home for their natural life.'"

            "text": "\tDETROIT - According to a recent study, the Great Lakes are in worse shape than previously realized. Pharmaceuticals - that is, medicinal drugs - caffeine and items such as toothpaste additives have been found farther out in the water than ever before. And they have been detected in worryingly high levels.\n\nThe disturbing new study was released last month. It was the first to thoroughly test for the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products - or PPCPs - within the Great Lakes.\n\nProfessor Rebecca Klaper, who co-authored the study, said she was surprised by its findings. She and the other researchers had expected that the PPCPs would be undetectable because of the Great Lakes' huge volumes of water. Lakes Michigan and Huron, for example, together have 2 quadrillion, or 2,000 trillion, gallons of water. The two lakes are connected.\n\nPharmaceuticals found in Lake Michigan two miles offshore included a diabetes medication and a hormone used in birth-control pills. The new findings are alarming researchers, who are now learning more about the dangers of PPCPs. The concern is that the products might harm fish and other aquatic life, Klaper said.\n\n## Health Threat To Great Lakes\n\nIf they are causing damage, Klaper said, we'll need to try to get rid of them through water treatment.\n\nKlaper and her team looked for 54 PPCPs and hormones in Lake Michigan. Testing was done over two years at varying distances from Milwaukee's two main wastewater treatment plants. Such plants are supposed to clean up wastewater - that is, water from sewer pipes feeding into the lake. Because sewage contains a lot of feces and urine, it also contains a lot of the chemicals humans take in. These can come from everything from soda to medicine.\n\nThirty-two of the PPCPs were found in Lake Michigan's water and 30 in the lake's sediments - that is, its mud. The most frequently found products were detected as far out as two miles from the wastewater treatment plants. These included:\n\n-Metformin, a diabetes medicine.\n\n-Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, soda and energy drinks.\n\n-Sulfamethoxazole, which is used to treat conditions such as urinary tract infections and inner-ear infections.\n\n-Triclosan, which is added to many products, including toothpaste and soaps.\n\nFourteen of the PPCPs were found in concentrations that had a medium or high ecological risk.\n\n\"The concentrations found in this study ... indicate a significant threat by PPCPs to the health of the Great Lakes,\" the research report states. The threat is particularly severe for plants, fish, and animals near the shore.\n\n## \"Exposed To A Chemical Soup\"\n\nWhile only Lake Michigan was studied, PPCPs most likely are also building up in other Great Lakes, according to Klaper.\n\nIt's alarming that the chemicals were found that far from shore, said Olga Lyandres, who works for the Alliance for the Great Lakes.\n\nPeople always knew that you had check for PPCPs right near where treated water was being emptied into the lake, she said. But it was assumed that because the lake is so large, PPCPs couldn't be \"affecting the lake as a whole.\"\n\nThe number and variety of PPCPs found is also making people worried, Lyandres said.\n\n\"There are some questions that are still unanswered,\" she said. \"You can study one chemical at a time, but in reality, we're exposed to a chemical soup.\"\n\nAnother study led by Klaper last year revealed some of the damage that may be being caused by PPCPs. The study exposed fathead minnows to low levels of two PPCPs commonly found in water: linuron and DEHP. Male minnows exposed to a mix of the chemicals had reduced levels of testosterone, a hormone needed for reproduction. This was not the case, however, when they were exposed to either one of the chemicals alone.\n\n## Water Treatment Doesn't Fully Remove PPCPs\n\nPPCPs are widely considered potentially harmful. But not much is known about what effect very low levels may have. This has meant that little to nothing is done about them when it comes to water treatment.\n\n\"We don't do anything specific for them,\" said Dave Johnson of the Muskegon Wastewater Management System. \"We have our treatment that's in place\" for sewage \"and that's all they get.\"\n\nThe Muskegon plant treats water for the city and surrounding areas. In 2010, Johnson said, it conducted a study of PPCPs in water coming into the plant and flowing out. The study showed wastewater treatment did not fully remove a number of products. These included the painkillers acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and the anesthetic lidocaine. Tests also found traces of sucralose, a sweetener sold under the brand name Splenda.\n\n\"That's why it's a very good dietary sweetener; it doesn't break down very well and you don't get the calories from it,\" Johnson said. \"But it works the same way at the wastewater treatment plant - the bacteria isn't able to break it down.\"\n\nThere are new treatment technologies that can remove low levels of PPCPs. But, Johnson said, only the newest plants have them. And remodeling older plants can be extremely expensive. Wastewater treatment officials will \"definitely wait and see\" what scientists come up with before doing any expensive remodeling, he said.\n\nResearchers should now concentrate on figuring out which PPCPs are the most important to remove, Klaper said. And also, how best to remove them.'"

            "text": "\tKLEINMACHNOW, Germany - Twenty-five years ago this week, the Berlin Wall fell, the Cold War ended, and many people had a chance for a new type of life.\n\nKlaus-Jurgen Warnick is one of those people. In November 1989, he was here in Kleinmachnow, outside Berlin, as East German guards decided that letting people go to the West was a better idea than opening fire on them.\n\nSince 1961, the Berlin Wall had split Berlin - and Germany - in half. On the West side were the Americans, British and French. On the East side was the Soviet Union (now Russia). Life was very different on the different sides of the wall.\n\nWest Berlin, at first run by the Americans, was capitalist, focusing on free trade and free speech. East Berlin was communist, run by the Soviets, who wanted to build a completely equal society where the government owned everything and controlled most things.\n\n## Ossies, Former East Germans\n\nEast Germans had little freedom during this time: they couldn't travel freely, criticize their government, or buy many goods.\n\nStill, Warnick says that East Germans like him who crowded around the Berlin Wall in 1989 weren't trying to change the world. They just had dreams that life could be a little better.\n\nIn many ways, life is better today for Ossies, the name given to former residents of East Germany. They have free speech and elections. They can travel and they are free from government spying.\n\nStill, Germany remains divided in many ways: Ossies are paid less, have a harder time finding jobs, have less money saved, and receive less money from the government when they retire than West Germans.\n\nEast and West Germany are still seen as unequal, even though the country is united again. East Germans make less than west Germans. Employees at one shopping mall in East Berlin make $1,400 less each year than workers at a mall across the street in West Berlin.\n\nIn Kleinmachnow, the problems of splitting, then reunifying a country, are on display, even 25 years later. In this town it's the Ossies who have often suffered from the changes.\n\n## \"I Planted Trees\"\n\nThe problem in Kleinmachnow comes down to owning a home.\n\nIn East Germany under communism, personal property was not important because the government owned everything. In West Germany, under capitalism, owning things - and buying and selling them - was a foundation of society.\n\nDuring the 1950s, as communism took over East Germany, many people left for the West, abandoning their houses. The East German government took the houses and gave them to people, trying to find places for everyone to live.\n\nWarnick received a piece of land in 1969 and began to build a house on it. He met the love of his life, and they had four children.\n\n\"I planted trees, so that my grandchildren's grandchildren would know their grandfather's grandfather had put down these roots,\" he said.\n\nWhen the Berlin Wall fell 20 years later, Germany began to reunite. West Germans could now return to the East.\n\n## His Dream For The Future\n\nIn 1990, Warnick began to have trouble. The former owner of the house returned from West Germany. The man was nice at first. He said Warnick didn't have to leave right away, he could have six months to find a new place.\n\nEventually, Warnick won the right to stay in the house he built. He had to pay $180,000 to the former owner and to lawyers. Still, it was worth it to him to keep his house and the trees he'd planted - his dream for the future.\n\nWarnick is not alone. In Kleinmachnow, almost every property was in a similar situation. Eight thousand of Kleinmachnow's 11,000 residents were forced to leave their homes after Germany was reunited. Nationwide, about 4 million of East Germany's 17 million people were forced to move.\n\nLooking back, Warnick says they lived in a nation with no idea about land ownership.\n\n\"Who believes that their nation, their way of life, will collapse?\" he asked.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES-Scientists say that the more popular teens are, the more likely they are to be bullied. Only the king and queen of the prom are safe from [bullying](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying).\n\nNearly a fifth of teens are bullied. Only the most popular kids at the very top of the high school social ladder avoid it. This may come as a surprise. Most people would think that the least popular kids were the only targets.\n\nScientists Robert Faris of the University of California at Davis and Diane Felmlee of Penn State University created the study. They found that older views of bullying don't tell the whole story. For most students, gains in popularity \"increase the likelihood of victimization,\" they wrote in the magazine of the American Sociological Association. As kids move up the social ladder, the victimization becomes more severe.\n\nThe bullies, too, often \"possess strong social skills.\" They may have tough lives at home and bully others to move up the social ladder, rather than re-create \"their own troubled home lives.\"\n\n## Want Increased Importance\n\nTeens at the very top of the social ladder can \"afford\" to be nice. Yet, those in the next level down have to fight to keep themselves there, Faris said.\n\nHe and Felmlee looked at how being popular can increase the chances of becoming a victim. Their study explored the effects of being bullied. Bullied kids can suffer from feelings of sadness, increased worries and thoughts of killing themselves.\n\nThe scientists wrote that the ways in which popularity can increase the risk of being bullied \"have been largely ignored\" and that they have identified \"a new pattern of victimization.\" And it can work, they said. Evidence suggests that bullies' constant abuse is rewarded with increased clout and importance. They particularly gain more power when they target popular rivals.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that popular kids get targeted. If the tormentor is aiming to move up the social ladder, targeting popular kids makes sense, the scientists wrote. And for the most popular victims, the fall can be more extreme.\n\nTo sort this out, the scientists used information from more than 8,000 students in 19 North Carolina schools. They asked them about their five closest friends, and five students who had \"picked on or were mean\" to them. Then they asked them about five kids they in turn had been mean to. They used that web of connections to draw their conclusions.\n\n## Seeking Some Sort Of Shield\n\nIn the group, about half the students were white and a third black. Most lived with two parents. Girls had higher rates of victimization. The researchers noted that there could be differences in other population groups.\n\nSome students found protection; being friends with teens of the opposite gender provided some sort of shield.\n\nThe scientists don't suggest that unpopular teens don't get bullied. But their study found that theirs is not the whole story.\n\nFaris also said that there was a message in the study for teenagers and their parents: It's probably better to have a few close friends than 200 Facebook friends. In addition, the \"drama\" that's often discussed about teenage relationships might be taken more seriously - by students and parents, he said.\n\nAnd many students, Faris said, don't see what's happening \"as bullying and they may be sort of like fish in water.\" They may be used to \"having a lot of drama around them.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - A $60 million project to repair the U.S. Capitol dome started with a coffee can full of rust.\n\nAlan M. Hantman, who was the Capitol's architect from 1997 through 2007, put some rusty parts from the dome in the can. Congress meets in the Capitol building. He used to carry the can to meetings held by lawmakers, to show them that the dome was crumbling above them.\n\nMany of the bolts that held the iron dome together had fallen off. The metal straps that held the dome's metal sheets together had cracked. The Capitol's dome was built more than 150 years ago and weighs nearly 9 million pounds,\n\n\"Cast-iron parts were basically holding each other in place,\" Hantman said.\n\nHe built a wooden rail just below the Statue of Freedom, which sits on top of the dome. He wanted to make sure that tourists who climbed near the top on tours would not shake anything loose.\n\n\"We didn't want people leaning on the railing up there,\" he said.\n\n## Decades To Secure Money For Repairs\n\nStill, it would take an additional 10 years before the architect who followed Hantman could get the money to begin fixing the dome. The new architect was Stephen T. Ayers. He had to rebuild ornaments, strip away layers of paint dating from a century ago, and replace some heavy glass windows.\n\nThe dome had not been repaired in more than 50 years. Since then rust has built up. Rain and snow worked their way into tiny holes in the cast iron, enlarging them, leaving more than 1,000 cracks.\n\nIn May 2014, workers began erecting the 1.1 million pounds of scaffolding. The scaffolding is a temporary structure built around the outside of the dome that lets workers fix it. It has become part of the view of the city. In the evening, it gives the Capitol an eerie glow.\n\nInside the dome, workers installed a puffy cloth just below the ceiling. It has a doughnut hole in the middle that allows visitors to see the mural painted on the inside of the dome.\n\n## Capitol's Unique Needs, Purpose Complicate Work\n\nThe repairs are being done a little at a time. Members of Congress want to be able to use the Capitol building during construction. They still need to get to their meetings there and also want the people back in their home states to be able to take tours of the building.\n\nTo make sure the project does not get in the way of those activities, much of the work has been done on nights and weekends. The rotunda is the large room under the dome. It has largely remained open to visitors and staff, closing for only a few weeks in April 2014.\n\nEven with all the work, few people argue that the cost and trouble is not worth the effort.\n\nDemocratic Representative Zoe Lofgren from California is on the committee that oversees the project. Lofgren said that lawmakers have to make sure that the dome doesn't get to the point where it falls apart. \"That's what this is all about.\"\n\n## But Schedule, Budget Are On Track\n\nLofgren said the project, so far, is on time. Workers have begun removing some of the scaffolding and plan to finish in time for the 2017 inauguration, the ceremony when the next president is sworn in. The project is on budget too, not costing more than planned. In addition to about $60 million for the dome repairs, the project includes $16 million to fix the inside and $21 million for work on the rotunda.\n\n\"We'll see if that can be maintained,\" she said about the repair cost. \"It's a major project.\"\n\n## Capitol Follows Washington Monument's Repair\n\nWashingtonians are used to monuments wrapped in scaffolding. Beginning in 2013, the Washington Monument, which honors George Washington, was wrapped in a metal frame so workers could fix damage from an earthquake. Unexpectedly, the scaffolding's geometric shape became a beloved part of the capital city's skyline.\n\nThe scaffolding around the monument was lit from within, which made it look like a glowing rocket ship. Some wanted the metal frame to stay there even after the work was complete, but it was removed in May 2014.\n\nLofgren thinks the Capitol scaffolding also looks like a spaceship.\n\n\"Obviously, it's not as beautiful as the building itself,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tCHARLOTTE, N.C. -  Lewis Hine created a type of American photography that showed people in daily life. In 1908, he captured a haunting image of a too-young worker in a cotton mill in Lincolnton, N.C. She was a little girl of 9 or 10, staring out a window.\n\nIt became one of the historic pictures among more than 5,000 he made while working for the National Child Labor Committee. He documented abuses of child labor laws in textiles and other industries. His work led to the start of documentary photography.\n\nMost of Hine's photos listed people's names, but the Lincolnton girl was identified only as a \"spinner\" at the Rhodes Manufacturing Co. A second photo of her in the same mill, standing next to an older girl and a woman, also had no names.\n\nNow, a Massachusetts historian believes he's solved the mystery of both images. He has tracked down descendants of 350 people in the Hine photos.\n\n## Photo And Possible Names Posted\n\nAuthor and historian Joe Manning spent five years trying to find the names of the people in the Lincolnton photos. He posted the pictures on his website and ran an ad in the Lincolnton Times-News, but got no responses.\n\nThen he came up with the idea of searching the 1910 Lincolnton census, a count of the population the government does every 10 years. He made a list of all white girls who were born around 1898 and had a sister who was about two years older. He found 12 names, including a girl named Lala Blanton.\n\nManning knew that thousands of people search online every day for information about their ancestors. So he published the names under the mystery photos on his webpage.\n\nTwo months later, he got an email from Myra \"Carol\" Cook of Louisville, Ky. She thought the person identified as Lala Blanton might be her late grandmother, who spelled her name Lalar Blanton.\n\nCook sent Manning pictures of Blanton as an adult in Shelby, N.C. He took them to Maureen Taylor, a face-recognition expert he'd relied on in the past. Taylor has been called the nation's best historical photo detective. She said the faces matched perfectly.\n\nManning and Cook feel confident the little girl in the photo is Lalar Blanton.\n\n\"I never cease to be amazed when I find descendants of people in the photos,\" said Manning, 72. He is a retired social worker in Florence, Mass. \"I'm not only giving them back their history, but I'm giving the children (in the photos) back their dignity.\"\n\n## Hunting Descendents Of Hine's Subjects\n\nFor 105 years, the unidentified girl by the window has been seen as \"nothing but a child laborer,\" said Manning. \"Now, we're finding out she was a person, not just a picture. She becomes a human being.\"\n\nManning became interested in Hine nine years ago. He is friends with the author Elizabeth Winthrop. A Hine photo of a young girl in a textile mill inspired a fictional character for one of her novels.\n\nWinthrop asked Manning to try to find out what happened to the real girl.\n\n\"It was an exciting idea,\" he said. \"I tracked down descendants and found her granddaughter in 11 days.\"\n\nManning has been hunting descendants of subjects in Hine photos ever since.\n\n\"I'm in awe\" of Manning's ability at tracking these people down, said professor Robert Allen. He has also found relatives of mill children in the Hine pictures.\n\nA Gastonia native and professor of American Studies, Allen found Gaston textile images in the Hine collection at the Library of Congress. In 2008 he helped start a community project exploring that history.\n\nNearly 30 descendants of children in the mills came to a Gastonia gathering. The event marked the 100th anniversary of Hine's picture-taking.\n\n## Fond Memories Of Granny\n\nThe photos give information about the history of children working the factories.\n\n\"It's so foreign to us today,\" said Allen.\n\nAs an adult, Cook was familiar with the famous Hine photo of the girl by the mill window. Studying old family snapshots, she always thought the child resembled her grandmother Blanton. She had died when Cook was 10.\n\nCook, now 50, remembers her grandmother as a \"kind, generous, godly woman.\" But she wasn't just a sweet old lady. She \"was real feisty. She could be tough,\" Cook recalled.\n\n\"If granny ever mentioned working in a mill, I don't recall,\" Cook added. \"But I do know she was very protective of children, especially little girls. She was determined I would have pretty things - clothes, dolls - all the things she didn't have as a little girl. She spoiled me rotten. She wouldn't let Mother spank me.\"'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - Eating a fatty Peking duck dinner might make some feel guilty about not watching their diet. But healthy types who dine at the Da Dong restaurant chain here in the Chinese capital don't have to feel so bad: They did a little weightlifting before their meal.\n\nThat's because the menus at Da Dong are heftier than a small gym dumbbell: 5 pounds, 4 ounces, to be exact. The 140-page menu measures 20 inches tall, 15 inches wide and more than an inch thick. It outweighs National Geographic's Global Atlas.\n\nPacked with rich color photos, the volume is divided into chapters. A table of contents listing about 200 dishes runs four pages.\n\nDa Dong's gigantic menu may be among the most eye-popping in town, but it's hardly alone in its big size and fancy design. All over China, restaurants have been supersizing.\n\n## BIG And Colorful\n\nMiddle-8th in Beijing uses a 128-page, 3-pound menu. At Pure Lotus, the golden-paged menu is huge: It stretches 2 1/2 feet wide and weighs 4 pounds, 5 ounces. If that isn't enough, another of their menus is carved into an inch-thick wooden plank, also 2 1/2 feet wide. Countless other restaurants offer customers menus as large and colorful as American high school yearbooks.\n\nLong Chinese menus are hardly new; just ask anyone who's ordered from a Chinatown takeout joint in the United States. Harley Spiller, who holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Chinese takeout menus at more than 10,000 and counting, says his longest comes from Grand Sichuan in New York City. But in general, Chinese menus in the U.S. are slimmer than in China.\n\nThere are many explanations for China's expanding menus.\n\nChinese cooking is very varied, and also very adjustable. Cooks can produce many different dishes out of the same few ingredients. Just switching from boiling to frying or using a slightly different sauce gives cooks a different dish. In addition, people get paid less than they do in the U.S. Restaurants can afford to have more cooks in the kitchen.\n\nFamily-style ordering, where everyone shares dishes, feeds a desire for a wide selection. In addition, cooks are eager to appeal to the different tastes of diners from China's various regions. Customers range from the spicy-loving Sichuanese to the more delicate-dining Shanghainese. Also, many Chinese like to show their generosity by treating others to big, fancy meals. That leads to a fondness for unusual and special dishes.\n\nRestaurant-owner Jen Lin-Liu offers yet another explanation. She says the supersizing is a reflection of two things: China's past as a poor country, mixed with its newfound wealth.\n\nThe Chinese can now afford all sorts of food they couldn't just 10 years ago, she said.\n\n## Dishes With Poetic Names\n\nDong Zhenxiang, the owner of Da Dong, says he started adding photos to his menu in the early 1990s. He found that foreigners as well as Chinese appreciated the visual guide.\n\nChinese dishes sometimes have names that are more like poetry than a description. \"Even Chinese people, if they don't know the story behind it, they'll find it hard to understand,\" he said. \"Take, for example, The Dragon and Tiger Fight. It's fish and chicken. But if you don't know that, you don't know what's in it. A picture will show you. Even I, as a professional chef, it's taken me years to realize why some dishes have their names.\"\n\nAs his menu grew more elaborate, Dong found himself with a problem: Customers were swiping them at a pace that made running his restaurants difficult.\n\n\"Ordinary customers and competitors would steal them; they would put them in their bags or under their coats. Waitresses would ask if they had taken them, and they'd just say 'no,' and we couldn't just search them,\" Dong recalled. \"We need about 200 menus for each restaurant, and we'd get down to 100 and there wouldn't be enough to allow people to order.\"\n\nSome restaurant-owners might have handled the situation by switching to simpler printouts. But Dong was inclined to go big and fancy.\n\nNow, his mega-menus are made once a year at a top printing house in Shenzhen, and theft is way down: Their sheer size makes them difficult to steal. Still, Dong said, \"we did have one person come in with a suitcase and manage to get one that way.\"\n\nIf diners really want to take home a menu, Dong said, there is a way: They can purchase last season's for $200.'"

            "title": "Are college recruiters shunning schools in  low-income areas?",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - The Webb Schools, a private high school in Claremont, attracts college recruiters from around the country and even the world. This fall, 113 Ivy League and other schools sent representatives to the campus. That's more than the 106 students in the senior class.\n\nThe story is different at Jefferson High School. It's a low-income public school in South Los Angeles with 280 seniors. Only eight recruiters from local universities showed up there.\n\nRecruiters' visits often are an important first contact for students. It allows them to discover schools far beyond their hometowns. And for colleges they offer an opportunity to discover talented students.\n\nCounselors and education experts say students lose out when recruiters skip their schools. They may be left behind in the competition to get into college and receive help with tuition for classes.\n\n## Little Money, Fewer Visits\n\nAcross Southern California, the story is the same: Campuses with a high proportion of low-income and minority students have fewer visits from college recruiters.\n\nAmong schools in well-off communities, La Canada High School had 127 visits from recruiters between August and November. Palisades Charter had 133; the private Marlborough School, a girls school, had 102.\n\nIn contrast, schools in low-income areas received far fewer visits. Pasadena High School had 20 visits over the fall semester; Compton High, five; Hoover High in Glendale, 15; Santa Ana High, five; Belmont High near downtown Los Angeles, about 25.\n\nSchools in poorer communities have trouble getting money and, as a result, visits from recruiters, said Jefferson Principal Michael Taft. He said his school lost funding for a full-time college counselor. That counselor had arranged visits. The counselor had also encouraged recruiters to overcome bad views about low-income, heavily minority public schools.\n\nColleges, particularly from out of state, say they do not discriminate against those schools. But they say they have limited time. And lack of money makes them return to schools where they've been successful in enrolling students. Some say that students' ability to pay for classes without a lot of help from the schools can sway their choices.\n\nAccording to education expert Gregory Wolniak, students at high schools receiving few recruiters often need more information and encouragement than do students at better-off schools. This is because they are more likely to come from families with less college experience.\n\n\"Having visits from schools can serve to compensate for some of those family background differences,\" said Wolniak.\n\n## Missing Talented Students?\n\nRoosevelt senior Beverly Vasquez said she found the college presentations at her public school helpful. But she believes more visits could expand students' horizons. It could help particularly with private and out-of-state colleges.\n\n\"I think it would make a huge difference,\" said Vasquez, who wants to study engineering.\n\nHer classmate Javier Evangelista also wants to study engineering. He said some colleges probably stay away from public schools like his because they don't think there could be a student in the school who could \"win the next Nobel Prize, come up with a new technology or change the world.\"\n\nHe added, \"I do believe they are making a mistake.\"\n\nAccording to education researcher Shaun R. Harper, too many colleges stick to traditional recruiting efforts. Many, he said, concentrate on high schools with lots of students who are the most ready for college. They also focus on schools that have previously sent graduates to enroll as freshmen.\n\n\"That is shameful since so many talented students are not given a chance or not introduced to the vast landscape of higher education opportunities,\" he said.\n\n## Seeking Low-Income Students\n\nIn research that tracked young Latino and black men with good grades in New York City, Harper found that many colleges avoided their high schools. They wrongly assumed, he said, \"that nothing good is going on.\"\n\nRecruiters say they seek talented minority and low-income students through other means than school visits. They find them through large college fairs, citywide recruiting sessions, online outreach and videotaped presentations. Some join community-based organizations that help young people enter college.\n\nNot receiving visits may hurt students' chances of getting into schools. Students who impress college representatives during high school visits may have a leg up in getting into schools. This is because recruiters usually help make decisions about who gets into the colleges and universities.\n\nJoshua Vincent, a Webb senior, said college visits to his school proved \"super-important.\"\n\n\"I got to know the people who might have my fate in their hands,\" he said. He said it doesn't feel like he handed his college application to complete strangers.'"

            "text": "\tBOGOTA, Colombia -- Wedged behind an exhaust-spewing bus and ahead of a honking car, Luis Enrique Neira urges his scrawny horse Pagatodo through a busy intersection. Neira has been a horse-cart driver, or a zorrero, since he was 12 years old. He scrapes out a living hauling loads and sometimes recycling scrap metal and cardboard.\n\nAuthorities say there are more than 2,290 zorreros in this bustling capital of 7.3 million, but the horsemen's days are numbered. Bogota is requiring them to trade in their horse and carts for small four-wheel vehicles. By the year's end, it will be illegal for horses to plod the streets.\n\n\"I've been a zorrero all my life and, thank God, I've always made enough money to put some yucca in my soup,\" said Neira, 51. He supports his wife, three children and five grandchildren with his horse cart. \"But I guess I will have to do something else now.\"\n\nRafael Rodriguez is the city's transportation head and is leading the program. On a recent morning he saw about a dozen zorreros bring in animals to a university where they'll be cared for and put up for adoption. Some hobbled in on split hooves, others with weeping saddle sores.\n\n## Beware Of Horse Droppings\n\nRodriguez said it's strange to find horses and mules pulling wooden carts through this major city. Bogota is almost as large as New York City and is South America's second-largest capital, packed with gleaming high-rises.\n\n\"It's a big contrast for everyone who comes here to Bogota. Some years ago, you could even find cows on the streets of the city,\" he said. \"We have a very relaxed way of living that allows many things like this. We have to tighten up a bit because the poor animals cannot keep living like that.\"\n\nBogota has been home to working animals since before colonial times. Horses and mules can also be found on the streets of Buenos Aires, Santiago and Montevideo. But in those cities the animals are usually kept in rural outskirts. In Bogota, horse carts are part of the urban landscape, snarling traffic and keeping pedestrians alert for horse droppings. City governments have been trying to get them off the streets for at least 50 years, Rodriguez said.\n\nPart of the problem is that there's no zorrero association or union, he said. \"They're a thousand-headed monster. You have to deal with each one of them individually and it has been very difficult,\" he added.\n\nThe program seems to work. Of the 2,890 working horses first identified, almost 600 have been turned in. Most of those have been adopted by farms, schools and other organizations.\n\n## \"I Don't Know How To Drive\"\n\nBut it's still not clear how well the program is working for zorreros themselves. The government hopes they will continue to make a living as scrap dealers and freelance haulers with their new motorized vehicles. But only 237 of the almost 3,000 zorreros in the program have a driver's license. The city says it will provide classes, but many worry that might not happen.\n\nRosa Garzon, 50, brought her horse Mil Amores to the trade-in. She received a paper that will entitle her to a vehicle. She said she could earn anywhere from $30 to $100 a day with her horse. But recent bypass surgery and bouts of low blood sugar make her scared of driving a motorized vehicle.\n\n\"I have a car now but they've left me without work. I don't know how to drive,\" she said, carrying a well-worn bridle. \"I hope one of my children will get a license and we can still make some money.\"\n\nDespite her shaky economic state, Garzon said she thinks the program is good. \"Maybe people will quit discriminating against us,\" she said. \"People are always saying 'Look at those zorreros, those thieves, and how they abuse their animals. And look how their horses are always crapping and pissing in the street.' \"\n\nThat harsh attitude of the horse-cart drivers was one of the problems in finding a reasonable solution, said Ricardo Mora. He is the Latin American program manager for the World Society for the Protection of Animals, which worked with the city on the project. Zorreros are stereotyped as animal-abusing thugs, he said. \"A lot of people were saying, 'Let's just take away the horses.' \"\n\nBut many zorreros have been on the job for 40 or 50 years, and have no other skills, he said. Images of skinny and mistreated horses gallop across social networks. But the vast majority of zorreros treat their animals with care.\n\n## \"A Very Noble Horse\"\n\n\"Some of the horses do live in very trying conditions, but so do the owners,\" Mora said. \"I've seen five people living in a small room and sharing the space with their horse.\"\n\nHumberto Rodriguez, 50, was dropping off his 4-year-old colt, Juancho, on a recent morning. When he was told that he couldn't see the horse after he was adopted, he began crying.\n\n\"This is like they were taking away a brother or a son,\" he said. \"Juancho is a very noble horse. I'm going to miss him for the rest of my life.\"\n\nAfter he collected himself, he wondered about a horseless Bogota.\n\n\"I know horses because I've seen them all my life,\" he said. \"But there are children who are never going to see one and they will always ask themselves, 'What is a horse?' \"'"

            "text": "\tWhen they grow up, the quiet kids from middle school will rule the world. Or, at least, they'll live healthier and more productive lives than the \"cool\" kids will.\n\nA new study looked at 13-year-olds who acted older than other kids their age - by doing things like dating or shoplifting. These were often seen as the \"cool kids.\"\n\nThe study found that these cool kids tended to develop problems with drugs and relationships by their early 20s.\n\nNearly 200 13-year-olds were tracked in the study for 10 years. A variety of behaviors were considered. Among them were how much students valued their popularity, how important appearance was in seeking out friends and if students used drugs or dated.\n\n## Popularity Doesn't Equal Social Skills\n\nThe researchers found that young teens who acted old for their age by doing such things as dating or shoplifting were considered popular. But as these \"pseudomature\" teens matured, things changed: Their behavior was no longer linked with popularity.\n\nInstead, they were thought to be less socially skilled than others their age, said Joseph Allen, who led the study. They also had more problems with drugs and alcohol.\n\nAllen said the average \"cool\" teen, by age 22, compared poorly with the average teen in the study. They had a 45 percent greater rate of problems due to drugs and alcohol. They also had a 22 percent greater rate of criminal behavior.\n\nTeens are impressed by these kids. Parents are impressed too, \"because they think that these pseudomature kids are on the fast track,\" Allen said.\n\n\"These kids are on the fast track,\" he said, \"but it's really to a dead end.\"\n\nHe added, \"They are gaining the appearance of maturity.\" But they are not gaining real maturity.\n\nResearchers suggest that these kids are failing to develop important life skills. They spend so much time trying to seem cool, they don't develop the skills needed for meaningful friendships.\n\n## It's Actually Cooler To Be Uncool\n\nThe study followed 86 male and 98 female middle school students for a 10-year period beginning in 1998. There were some surprises, Allen said.\n\nIn particular, it turns out that the sort of older behavior involved with dating early or minor theft is an excellent predictor of future drug and alcohol abuse. In fact, it is a better predictor than drug and alcohol use in middle school.\n\nResearchers are still following the students to see how they do later in life. All are now in their mid- to late 20s.\n\nOne conclusion of the study will be welcome: Parents shouldn't worry too much if their young teens don't seem that popular. If a kid prefers to spend Saturday nights at home watching a movie or reading instead of going out with friends, Allen said, there's no need for concern.\n\nMany \"uncool\" teenagers, he said, do much better later on than the popular kids do.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Sarah Ball was 15 and a sophomore at Hernando High School in Brooksville, Fla., when a friend posted on Facebook: \"I hate Sarah Ball, and I don't care who knows.\"\n\nThen there was the Facebook group \"Hernando Haters\" asking to rate her attractiveness. An email called her a \"waste of space.\" The emailer did not give his or her name. And this text arrived on her 16th birthday: \"Wow, you're still alive? Impressive. Well happy birthday anyway.\"\n\nIt wasn't until Sarah's mom saw the messages that the girl told her everything.\n\nMore young people are telling their family members about being [harassed](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) online, and it's helping. A poll released Thursday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found incidents of \"digital abuse\" are still happening a lot. But they are declining a bit.\n\n## More Teens Talking About Cyberbullying\n\nTeenagers and young adults are growing more aware about the harm done from online meanness and cyberbullying, the poll showed. There was also a slight increase among those willing to tell a parent or sibling.\n\n\"It was actually quite embarrassing, to be honest,\" remembers Ball, now an 18-year-old college freshman. But \"really, truly, if it wasn't for my parents, I don't think I'd be where I'm at today.\"\n\nThe survey's findings come a week after two Florida girls, ages 12 and 14, were arrested for allegedly bullying a 12-year-old girl online. The girl later killed herself by jumping off a tower at an abandoned concrete plant.\n\nThe poll found that 49 percent of young people ages 14 through 24 in the U.S. said they have had at least one brush with some kind of electronic harassment. That is down from about 56 percent in 2011. Of those who have encountered an incident, 34 percent went to a parent, compared with 27 percent just two years ago. And 18 percent asked a brother or sister for help. Only 12 percent did two years ago.\n\n\"I feel like we're making progress,\" said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor at Florida Atlantic University. \"People should be encouraged.\"\n\nWhen asked what helped, 72 percent of those who faced online abuse said that they changed their email address, screen name or cell number. Meanwhile, 66 percent who talked to a parent said it helped too. Less than one-third of people who retaliated found that helpful, while just as many said it had no effect, and 20 percent said getting revenge actually made the problem worse.\n\n## \"Cool To Care\" About Others\n\nGirls were more likely than boys to be the targets of online meanness. They also were more likely to reach out for help.\n\nThe poll also indicated that young people are becoming more aware of the impact of cyberbullying. Some 72 percent, up from 65 percent in 2011, said online abuse was a problem that society should address. Those who think it should be accepted as a part of life declined from 33 percent to 24 percent.\n\nHinduja credits school programs that are making it \"cool to care\" about others. Adults who can help teens talk through their options are more aware of the problem, too, he said. Those options can include deactivating an account or going to school administrators for help in removing hurtful postings.\n\nThat was the case for Ball. Her parents encouraged her to fight back by speaking up. \"They said this is my ticket to helping other people,\" she said.\n\nWith their help, Ball sent copies of the abusive emails, texts and Facebook pages to school authorities, news outlets and politicians. She also organized an anti-bullying rally. She still maintains a Facebook site called \"Hernando Unbreakable,\" and she works with local kids identified by the schools as victims of cyberbullying.\n\n## Many Schools Can Punish Cyberbullies\n\nBall  said she thinks if other teens are reaching out more for help, it's as a last resort. Many kids fear making it worse, she said. That was one reason Jennifer Tinsley, 20, said she didn't tell her parents in the eighth grade when another student used Facebook to threaten to stab and beat her.\n\n\"I didn't want them to worry about me,\" Tinsley, now a college student in Fort Wayne, Ind., said of her family. \"I just didn't want the extra attention.\"\n\nAccording to the Cyberbullying Research Center, every state but Montana has anti-bullying laws. Many of the laws address cyberbullying specifically. Most state laws are focused on allowing school districts to punish offenders. In Florida, for example, a law was passed allowing schools to discipline students harassing others off campus.\n\nIn Florida's recent cyberbullying case, the police took the unusual step of charging the two teen girls with aggravated stalking. Even if convicted, however, the girls were not expected to spend time in juvenile jail because they didn't have criminal histories.\n\nThe AP-NORC Center/MTV poll was conducted online Sept. 27 through Oct. 7 among a national sample of 1,297 people between the ages of 14 and 24. Funding for the study was provided by MTV as part of its campaign to stop digital abuse, \"A Thin Line.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - It has been 11 months since Beth Capper's son Ezekiel was born. Since then Capper, a Los Angeles mom, has gone days at a time without food to keep up her supply. It's not drugs or alcohol or even baby formula that Capper needs. It's diapers.\n\n\"There's no way around buying them,\" said Capper. The 41-year-old single mom doesn't work because of a disability.\n\nLike Capper, many mothers across the country cannot afford to keep their children in clean diapers. According to a report published in the journal Pediatrics, this is a problem that affects a large number of low-income Americans. Nearly 30 percent of mothers questioned for the study live in New Haven, Conn., and do not have enough diapers for their children.\n\nIt's a big problem that often goes unnoticed.\n\n\"I call it the silent epidemic,\" said Caroline Kunitz, who runs L.A. Diaper Drive. An epidemic is a problem that affects a large portion of the population. Kunitz's organization will distribute 1.5 million diapers around Southern California this year.\\n## A Constant Need\n\nIn Los Angeles, organizations report that the need for diapers is constant. These same organizations also report that diapers fly out of warehouses as soon as they're delivered.\n\nWhen word spread that a Los Angeles-based organization was handing out diapers directly to parents, desperate parents came to its office. The problem was that no diapers were being handed out. It was a big mistake. But parents didn't find out about the mistake until they had formed a long line, said Norah Weinstein, who works at the organization. The organization also received 3,000 voicemail messages that day.\n\nParents in need can get financial support from the government to pay their health-care costs. That health program is called Medicaid. Another program helps parents in need pay their rent. There is even a program that helps parents pay for food. But there are few places for parents to go when they need help paying for diapers.\n\nOn average it costs $18 a week to keep a young child dry and clean. A single mother earning $15,080 a year in a minimum-wage job would have to spend a little over $900 a year on diapers, according to the Pediatrics study. Minimum-wage work usually pays $10 and under per hour.\n\nMany families that earn [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) can't afford to buy mass amounts of diapers at stores like Costco and Target. And cloth diapers are often not an option because they require many trips to the laundromat. Those trips can become very expensive over time.\\n## Talking To Moms\n\nCo-authors Megan Smith of the Yale School of Medicine and Joanne Goldblum of the National Diaper Bank Network have been researching the diaper problem in the United States. They went to schools, stores, bus stops, beauty parlors and other locations in New Haven to talk to mothers.\n\nSmith and Goldblum asked the women about their health and medical care. They also asked the women about access to basic needs like food, housing and diapers.\n\nThey found that over 25 percent of the women in the study were in need of diapers. In order to get diapers for their children, the women had to ask for help from organizations, friends or family. Latinas had a higher level of need than African-American and white women. Women 45 or older, who the team assumed were mostly caring for grandchildren, also had greater need.\n\nWomen who said they had a lot of difficulty managing stress or sadness were nearly twice as likely as others to report diaper need, said Smith. \"The inability to provide a diaper increases the stress levels of mothers incredibly,\" she said.\n\nNearly 8 percent of the women in the study reported that they \"stretched\" diapers when they needed more diapers. Stretching a diaper is removing a dirty diaper, tossing out the solid waste, and then returning the diaper to the baby's bottom.\n\nWearing the same diaper for too long can lead to problems. Those problems include skin rashes and bacterial infections that require medicine.\\n## Diaper Need Hurts Wallets\n\nDiaper need also affects families' economic well-being, Smith and Goldblum said. Most child-care providers require that parents supply diapers. When families can't, children miss days in day care and parents miss days at work or school.\n\nIn 2011, Representative Rosa DeLauro introduced a bill in Congress. She wanted to make it easier for parents to use federal money to get diapers. In a letter to government officials, DeLauro mentioned that more than 1 in 5 mothers have had to stay home with their child because they didn't have diapers to send to day care.\n\n\"Losing out on day care makes it even harder for parents to put in a full day's work,\" she wrote. \"And so they fall further behind.\"\n\nDeLauro's effort failed. Critics like radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh told his radio audience that the bill \"gives a new meaning to the term 'pampering the poor.'\"\n\nFor now, parents in need of diapers will have to ask organizations for help.\\n## Diapers For Attending Classes\n\nCapper gets free diapers through Children's Institute Inc. Many of the 25,000 children and families served by Children's Institute receive diapers as a reward. In exchange for attending parenting classes, parents get diapers, said Megan Aubrey, who works at the Institute.\n\nThe promise of diapers motivates parents to keep showing up for class, said Aubrey.\n\n\"No one wants to have their child in a soiled diaper all day long,\" she said. \"It's a basic thing, but it's really empowering.\"\n\nBut when parents graduate out of the program they're, for the most part, back on their own.'"

Since then, he has been grabbing his old, black leather bag and making house calls in the city's most dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n## Helping Other Students In Turn\n\nRichardson also has helped inner-city students struggling with medical school. Three days a week, he helps them with their classwork at no charge.\n\n\"He's our brightest light,\" said John Bradley with the Chicago Area Health and Medical Careers Program. The program helps poor black and Hispanic students through medical school. By Bradley's count, Richardson has saved 50 students from dropping out of medical school, the most of anyone doing that kind of work.\n\n\"He's tremendous,\" Bradley said.\n\nRichardson knew no black doctors when he entered Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1982. His mother was a bookkeeper and his father was a construction worker who struggled with alcoholism. The family lived in a poor area with few jobs and much crime. They moved frequently, and Richardson remembers spending a night in a homeless shelter.\n\n## Mom Pushed For Excellence\n\nThere are many reasons why Richardson became a doctor, but it all started with his mother, Gladys Richardson.\n\n\"Her goal in life was to educate her children because she thought that was the only way out of Englewood,\" Richardson said, describing the tough South Side neighborhood where he grew up. His mother was strict and stressed schoolwork and excellence, he said.\n\nGladys supported the family, somehow earning enough to keep her four kids in Catholic schools. Homework was taken seriously, and straight A's were expected.\n\nThat was her way of making sure her children avoided the dangerous path many young people took in Englewood, he said.\n\nRichardson's neighborhood friends \"were into all sorts of bad things,\" but they protected him and his younger brother, Lendell, who also became a doctor. Their friends respected their dream of becoming doctors.\n\nTheir attitude was \"OK, don't mess with them because they may have to take care of us,\" Richardson said.\n\n## He Keeps On Going\n\nWhen he was young, Richardson dreamed of playing shortstop for baseball's Cubs, but he knew that education was his path in life.\n\nIn high school, he was one of the best students in his class and earned a scholarship to Loyola University in Chicago. In medical school, he was the only black male in his class.\n\nMedical school was so tough that Richardson had to study 12 hours a day. To get through it, Richardson said he relied on the example his mother set - and still does.\n\nAs a doctor, Richardson works six days a week. His patients can call him 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He says he sleeps four hours a night and does not drink alcohol or coffee.\n\nWhat keeps him going is the effect he has on people's lives.\n\nOn the same night he made a house call to Louise Cannon, he visited the home of 95-year-old Alberta Bowles, who lives alone.\n\nHe asked about her shortness of breath and gently massaged her hands, asking her if they hurt.\n\n\"One of the things I enjoy the most about having a doctor like Dr. Fred is that he's a good listener,\" Bowles said. \"He is the son I didn't have.\"\n\n## Next Generation Of Doctors\n\nAfter he finishes making house calls, he helps medical students study to be doctors.\n\nTwenty years ago, Clyde Whiting was one of those students.\n\nWithout Richardson's help, he might not have finished medical school. \"I could have been lost,\" he said.\n\nToday, Whiting is an emergency room doctor and Richardson is his own personal doctor.\n\nAt Louise Cannon's house, Richardson checked her blood pressure and hearing. After that, he let her 2-year-old great-great-granddaughter listen to her own heartbeat with his stethoscope.\n\n\"There you go,\" Richardson said. \"You could be a doctor someday.\"'"

            "title": "That parking meter is really a donation meter",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - It's something you might have wondered when asked for money by a homeless person: Will the change in my pocket prevent hunger or support an addiction?\n\nPasadena is now testing an alternative to giving money to panhandlers.\n\nFourteen repurposed parking meters across the city will collect change for nonprofits that help the homeless. The meters are painted bright orange and decorated with smiley faces and inspirational sayings. They are supposed to raise awareness for the city's homeless programs.\n\nPasadena is the first city in Los Angeles County to try the donation meters, though Los Angeles has been talking about trying them out in downtown. Officials do not expect to raise huge sums of money. The two meters currently in place raised just $270 over three weeks. \"This is a clear alternative,\" said Bill Huang, who works with the city. He says people will now know where their money is going.\n\n## Meters Get Mixed Reviews\n\nBut the meters have sparked debate. Some people say the donation meters would suck up all the money that could go to genuinely needy people. Paul Boden is the director of a homelessness advocacy group. He says the meters would not be needed if we addressed the economic and social issues that contribute to homelessness.\n\nHe thinks the meter programs are useless and says they are designed to help cities push out the homeless. In San Diego and Denver, for example, the donation meters were used as panhandling deterrents, installed in areas where people gathered to ask for money. Pasadena officials said their main goal is to raise awareness. They also admit the meters could reduce panhandling too.\n\nThe view on the streets of Pasadena is mixed.\n\nDorothy Edwards, 56, used to panhandle, or ask for money, by the Target in eastern Pasadena. She would use the money to buy food for her dog, rain gear and tents. Buying her own supplies helped her feel independent, but the money also made it easier for her to stay homeless, she said.\n\n\"Homeless people wouldn't be out there doing that if they didn't really need it,\" said Edwards, who found permanent housing in 2011 after a city worker approached her. \"But when you look at the big picture, the meters are going to be a long-term solution.\"\n\n## Where The Money Is Really Needed\n\nBut other homeless people are uneasy about the idea. Holly Johnson, a woman panhandling on Lake Avenue, said that nonprofits don't always spend money on what homeless people need. Granola bars are pointless for people without healthy teeth and canned food is no good without a can opener.\n\nShe needs money for her own reasons like her health and safety. Underneath an eye patch her eye is red and swollen from infection. She also said the outdoors are especially dangerous for women. Panhandling money could pay for a hotel room where she could sleep without fear of sexual assault. \"It's a nice idea,\" Johnson said. \"But we won't get that money.\"\n\nPasadena leaders argue the meters could encourage the public to give more. They say people might feel better knowing that their money will not be used for drugs or alcohol. That would attract people who would not otherwise give.\n\nHuang cited a recent survey by a neighborhood in San Francisco. It found 44 percent of panhandlers surveyed admitted to purchasing drugs and alcohol with handouts, in addition to food. About 31 percent of visitors to San Francisco's Union Square said they would prefer to donate to services supporting the homeless. They would rather do that than give money directly to the panhandlers.\n\n## Some Cities Have Better Luck\n\nSince 2007, Denver, Colorado, has installed 55 refurbished parking meters to collect donations. Officials claim the meters have cut down on panhandling while raising more than $30,000 annually for food, housing and therapy for the homeless. In other cities the results have been more modest. In Orlando, Florida, 15 parking meters raised $2,027 in three years. That's just $27 more than what the city spent to install them. In downtown San Diego, California, about 20 meters generate about $3,600 a year in change.\n\nThe Pasadena meter campaign was designed by a class of students at the Art Center College of Design and cost about $350,000. It was paid for by money from companies. The meters were also donated and most of the cash was spent on the design of the meters, Huang said. No city funds were used.\n\nTwo local organizations will collect the money from the meter, and groups helping the homeless can apply for the cash. Businesses can also sponsor meters for a $1,500 annual donation, which will pay for the future upkeep of the meters.\n\nHuang says the money could help low-wage workers pay their back rent to avoid being kicked out of their homes. He also says it could build housing for the homeless and help pay for cheaper housing. Programs like these have helped cut Pasadena's homeless population in half over the last three years, down from 1,300 in 2011 to about 650, officials said.'"

            "text": "\tTHREE RIVERS, Calif. - Tourists and animal lovers hoping to see a bear in Sequoia National Park this fall might be disappointed. They probably stand a better chance of spotting one in this tiny town at the park's entrance.\n\nThree Rivers is a town in central California that is absolutely crawling with hungry bears. They venture down from the mountains because of the drought. The lack of rain has dried up their food supply, so they head in to town to find things to eat. They need to fatten up for winter so they can hibernate.\n\nEveryone seems to have photos of the creatures on their phones or stories of coming into contact with them.\n\n## Plenty Of Acorns In Town\n\nChas Haws' eyes bugged out as he recalled his surprise meeting with a bear one day. It happened before dawn as he walked to Antoinette's Coffee and Goodies shop along the main road.\n\nHe carefully stepped back as the bear reared up and then walked away.\n\n\"He didn't care about me at all,\" Haws said. \"I didn't smell like a muffin - yet.\"\n\nThere is no doubt bears are invading this town, which has a population of about 2,200. It is home to a mixed group of park workers, cattle ranchers, hippies, yuppies and artists. It is also a retreat for Hollywood actors and actresses.\n\nMost seem to be delighted by the visiting black bears, many of which are brown and cinnamon in color. They can be seen lumbering through grasslands, trotting across roads or wading through rivers.\n\nThe four-year drought has ruined the berry crop in the Sierra Nevada mountain range and led oak trees on parched hillsides to produce fewer acorns. Now the bears have been forced into the valleys where towns are located.\n\nWater is plentiful in towns and acorns carpet the ground.\n\n## \"The Park Is Upon Us\"\n\nGregory Lockhart had seen one bear in 27 years until this season. Now they can often be spotted on the golf course out his back door and have been seen by the pool of a guest house.\n\n\"The park is upon us now,\" he said.\n\nOne person suggested in a Facebook discussion that visitors seeking bears not even bother going into the park. Other people made suggestions about where to find them.\n\nQuiet nights are interrupted by air horns, banging on pots or a gunshot to scare off bears known to search for food 20 hours a day as they prepare for long winter naps. Yet some people wonder if those shots are innocent.\n\nJeff Beck heard dogs barking in the middle of the night followed by gunfire.\n\n\"People are shooting the bears, there's no doubt,\" he said.\n\n## Conflicting Bear Stories\n\nA local newspaper reported that bears have been illegally killed. Others say there is no evidence of that.\n\nThe story, however, has created conflict between nature lovers and those who think it is untrue.\n\n\"I'm upset and sad, and I just question, 'Why?'\" Kathleen McCleary said, adding that some people feel a sense of outrage. \"I don't see any reason to be shooting them.\"\n\nDarrell Fleeman was so disgusted with the story that he stopped putting ads in the newspaper for his car repair shop.\n\n\"Where's the proof?\" he said. \"If that were the case, there'd be dead bears everywhere.\"\n\nState wildlife officers have not had as many complaints in this area of central California as last season, when bears made it to other cities in the valley.\n\nIn some towns, bears have been killed legally after they broke into cabins and cars.\n\n## Bears Need Full Stomachs For Winter\n\nIn Three Rivers, bears have knocked over plenty of garbage cans and raided fruit trees and grape vines.\n\nThey caused damage to an apple orchard at a ranch owned by actor William Shatner. The ranch caretaker said he got a permit to kill the offenders but never used it.\n\nBear hunting season runs until December 27 or when a statewide limit of 1,700 bears is killed. The state has not come close to that figure since dogs were outlawed in the hunt in 2013.\n\nGunfire may not be the biggest challenge for the bears at this point.\n\nIf they do not pack on enough pounds, they will not return to the mountains to den for the winter, said David Graber. He was a scientist for the National Park Service and is a longtime Three Rivers resident.\n\n\"If they don't hibernate, they're going to die,\" Graber said. \"That's a rare, uncommon event.\"'"

            "text": "\tWORCESTER, Mass. - Dr. Rick Sacra was given a second chance at life one year ago. He was cured of a deadly disease that has killed thousands.\n\nOn September 25, 2014, the 52-year-old Massachusetts physician stepped out of an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital. He had been successfully treated for the deadly virus Ebola.\n\nSacra caught Ebola while delivering babies in a hospital in Liberia, a country in West Africa. After being rushed back to the United States, he spent three rough weeks in the Omaha hospital. He suffered through fevers, vomiting, diarrhea and aches, never knowing if he was going to make it.\n\n\"Of course I knew that I might die,\" Sacra said this week. \"It made me very aware of how grateful I am for every day I'm given.\"\n\nSacra says he is now \"100 percent\" recovered and is feeling fine.\n\n## No Regrets\n\nMost West Africans who catch Ebola and manage to stay alive are not as lucky as he is, Sacra added. Many still have serious health problems. Often, people view them with fear and avoid them.\n\nSacra says he does not regret a thing, and he would do it all over again if he had to. \"Some risks are worth taking,\" he says. \"Even if I had died due to Ebola last year, I would not have changed what I did.\"\n\nSacra has spent many years working as a doctor in some of the world's poorest countries, where trained doctors are very badly needed. It did not take him long after he recovered from Ebola to get back to work.\n\nSacra is now immune to Ebola - once you have had the disease, you cannot catch it again. He has returned to Liberia three times so far this year.\n\n## Doctor Keeps Returning To Liberia\n\nIn April and then again in July, Sacra returned to the Liberian hospital where he caught Ebola. He has worked there for parts of every year over the last 20 years. The hospital is located just outside the capital city of Monrovia.\n\nSacra is now back in the United States but plans to return to the Liberian hospital again in November.\n\nSo far Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people. Doctors say it is now under control, but it has not been completely wiped out yet. Just weeks ago, Liberia was declared \"Ebola-free\" for the second time this year. Neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, however, continue to see a few new Ebola cases each week.\n\n## Need For Medical Help Is Still Great\n\nSacra says Liberia's need for trained doctors and nurses is just as great now as it was during last year's Ebola outbreak. Many Liberians stayed away from hospitals at the peak of the outbreak, because they were afraid they would catch the disease. Now many are just starting to return to hospitals, seeking treatment for other serious health problems.\n\nThe sudden rush of new patients is hard for many of Liberia's hospitals to handle. They just do not have enough doctors and nurses.\n\nSacra has no plans to stop his trips back to Liberia, which he travels to four times a year.\n\n\"When Liberia is on its feet again and it doesn't need help anymore, I'll probably move on to someplace else,\" he said. \"But as long as the needs are there and I can make a difference, I think I ought to keep doing it.\"'"

            "text": "\tGalden Sherpa wasn't startled by the low, thunderous boom he heard at the bsae camp of Mount Everest. Mountain climbers are used to such noises, which happen when the ice breaks under the sun's morning heat.\n\nBut then he heard the radio: A massive glacier had crashed down the mountain. Twenty-five Nepalese sherpa guides were buried under ice sheets the size of houses.\n\nThe next morning, Galden flew down the mountain in a helicopter. He hiked a short distance to where a dead body lay half-buried in the snow. Using a shovel and ax, he helped uncover the body. His heart sank when he recognized the face of a friend laying before him.\n\n## Time For A Different Job\n\nIn all, 13 bodies were recovered, nine men were rescued and three sherpas remained missing.\n\nGalden will not return to Mount Everest this year. His mother begged him to find another job. The 28-year-old knew she was right. The job had become deadly and it was devastating to see his friends die on the mountain. Still, it was not easy for Galden to leave the career that he had known for so long.\n\nThe avalanche in April 2014 was the deadliest ever recorded on Mount Everest. The mountain is the world's highest peak. All 16 victims who died in the disaster were sherpas, the term for local men who are paid to help tourists climb the mountain. Sherpas guide climbers, carry supplies and work at the camps. The profession is dominated by the ethnic Sherpa people who live in the Himalayan highlands, at the bottom of Mount Everest.\n\nA sherpa can earn up to $6,000 for reaching the top of Mount Everest, which is a lot of money in a country where most people make about $700 a year. Many sherpas earn extra income in the offseason by guiding tours of the lower peaks and studying English.\n\n## More Sherpas Needed\n\nThe climbing and weather conditions have changed a lot over the years at Mount Everest. Temperatures are increasing on the mountain, which melts the ice and leads to avalanches. In addition, as more climbers visit the peak, the working conditions get worse for the sherpas.\n\nThe mountain is extremely important to Nepal's tourism industry. According to the Himalayan Database, 658 people reached the summit of Everest in 2013, five times the number in 2000.\n\nWith customers willing to pay more than $60,000 to reach the summit, tour companies compete to provide their wealthy clients with luxury comforts. High-end expeditions now offer sushi, espresso, fully stocked bars and Internet cafes on the mountain. These amenities require equipment, which means that sherpas need to haul it all up themselves.\n\n## Safety And Insurance\n\nThe Nepalese government has taken some steps to make the climbing industry safer. They require that companies have insurance policies for their sherpas. These policies will help pay for any injuries the sherpas get while climbing the moutnain. Officials also contributed money to education funds for children of sherpas who died and paid death benefits to families following last year's avalanche.\n\nSome critics say that country should be doing more and that the families of sherpas who are killed should receive more money from the government.\n\nThe avalanche happened early in the morning on April 18. As the foreign climbers slept at base camp, the sherpas set off to begin preparations for the day's journey. They slowly hauled supplies up the peak, through a long maze of jagged glaciers and yawning crevasses. Shaky aluminum ladders lined the pathway to give the climbers support when walking.\n\n## The Ice Crashed Down\n\nThe team stopped for more than half an hour, working to repair a broken ladder. As they worked, a \"traffic jam\" developed, recalled Dawa Tashi, a 23-year-old sherpa.\n\nSuddenly the ice crashed down. Tashi turned his body as the snow hurtled toward him to protect his spine from impact. He then fell unconscious.\n\nEventually, rescuers found his body and dug him out of the snow using a shovel. His left shoulder, four ribs and nose were broken, and sharp pieces of ice had lodged in his face. It took him months to recover.\n\nTashi hasn't decided about whether he will return to climbing. His wife and doctor have encouraged him not to. But Tashi is the son of a climber and the oldest of three brothers. He feels a sense of duty that is hard to deny.\n\n\"The whole family would be unhappy if I go back,\" he said. \"But our profession is mountaineering. It will be difficult for me to do anything else.\"'"

            "text": "\tPHOENIX - Retired surgeon Peter Rork feels like Santa Claus with his sled.\n\n\"I've got all kinds of goodies in back of my plane,\" Rork said.\n\nRork's co-pilot is Doyle, his black Labrador retriever. His sled is a Cessna airplane. And his precious cargo sometimes barks.\n\nRork and Doyle, who live together in Jackson Hole, Wyo., spend their free time flying dogs and cats around the country. Their last flight in March included 30 small dogs traveling from Arizona to a shelter in Idaho.\n\n## Dog Is My CoPilot\n\nRork's organization, Dog Is My CoPilot, is one of several groups around the country that take dogs by car and plane from one state to another. When there are too many types of animals abandoned in one part of the country, the groups take them to another part. The fear is if there are too many dogs of a certain breed, not all of them will be adopted and some of them may be put to sleep.\n\nOn trips out of Arizona, the breed usually filling Rork's plane is Chihuahuas.\n\nThere are too many Chihuahuas in Arizona, said Melissa Gable. She is the spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Animal Care and Control shelter. \"Sending them some place where they might not have as many Chihuahuas certainly means they'll get adopted a lot quicker than they would if they stayed here.\"\n\nIn February, Arizona Chihuahua Rescue worked with Animal Care and Control. It transferred 25 Chihuahuas to an animal rescue group in Pennsylvania.\n\nJudy Zimet is a Phoenix lawyer and the executive director of Dog Is My CoPilot. The group flies dogs to 10 states in the Western U.S. Since it was founded two years ago, Rork has flown more than 1,000 animals to no-kill shelters in other states. A no-kill shelter will not kill animals to make room for new animals when the shelter is full.\n\nHow the breeds are chosen comes down to supply and demand, Zimet said. In some states, the groups take big breeds from shelters and transfer them to cities that don't have them. San Francisco, for instance, may not have a lot of large, floppy-eared breeds.\n\n## \"Chihuahua Country\"\n\nMaricopa County sends many small dogs to out-of-state rescue groups.\n\n\"Arizona is specifically Chihuahua country for us,\" Zimet said.\n\n\"Before we were bringing dogs, people would go to the shelter and they wouldn't find what they wanted. And they'd end going to the puppy mills or they'd go on Craigslist or to breeders,\" she said. Puppy mills are dog breeding centers that have the reputation for putting profits over the health of the animals. \"But now people can find what they need at the shelters, and that way we help reduce overpopulation,\" she said.\n\nKari Nienstedt is the Arizona director for the Humane Society of the United States. She said transporting animals to other regions is a national trend.\n\n\"I think it really kicked into high gear after Hurricane Katrina,\" Nienstedt said. Hurricane Katrina was a monster hurricane that hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005. Many pets were separated from their owners or were abandoned. After that, people realized some areas had too many pets and other areas too few.\n\n\"Up North there are a lack of puppies and small dogs. So sometimes they're shipping from South to North, sometimes they're shipping from West to East,\" she said. \"It's a great opportunity to reduce euthanasia (killing animals) in some of these cities.\"\n\n## \"A Labor Of Love\"\n\nMichael Morefield is the shelter manager at the Arizona Animal Welfare League. Maricopa County has the second-largest rate of euthanasia for cats and dogs in the country. The first is Los Angeles County.\n\nMorefield said Chihuahuas and pit bulls are the most common breed put down in Arizona.\n\nIn 2012, he said, 2,476 Chihuahuas were euthanized.\n\n\"It's massive; we have a very serious problem in Maricopa,\" he said.\n\n\"One of our dogs that was taken to Canada lasted three hours before he was adopted,\" he said.\n\nJonathan McDonell is with HALO Animal Rescue. He said working with Dog Is My CoPilot has been tremendously successful.\n\nHe called it \"a fantastic opportunity.\" The group helps HALO get dogs that have been there awhile into communities that really want them.\n\nLeigh Carter also works at HALO. She said 12 of the 30 dogs that were sent to Idaho last Friday have been adopted.\n\nRork, who supports Dog Is My CoPilot mainly himself, said he knows the animals he leaves behind likely won't survive. So he tries to pack as many dogs into the plane as possible.\n\n\"It's like a puzzle trying get all the crates in the plane,\" he said. \"It really is a labor of love and money, but I enjoy it.\"'"

            "text": "\tMost people will tell you they prefer fresh, tasty, healthy food over greasy fast food. The millennial generation, though, may be the first to put their money where their mouth is.\n\nFast-food restaurants say they are getting increasing pressure from the millennial generation to serve better food. Millennials are generally defined as 18- to 34-year-olds. And there's a lot of money at stake - more than $1 trillion.\n\nConsumer Reports recently asked readers to judge fast-food chains on quality, value and healthy menu items. They ranked older chains like Burger King, Krystal and Church's Chicken near the bottom. Consumer Reports is a magazine that publishes product reviews.\n\nAlthough they cost more, fast-casual restaurants are becoming more popular, according to the magazine. The fast-casual category offers counter service, like fast food, but the food is healther.\n\n## Quality Is Beating Out Quickness\n\nFood quality is mattering more to millennials than the convenience of fast food.\n\n\"Millennials have a renewed fascination with food,\" said David Farmer, a vice president at the Chick-fil-A chain. \"They grew up on food television and are more knowledgeable about ingredients. And social media has put a lot of attention on quality and customization.\"\n\nEsther Yi, who is 25, counts herself among that group. Yi is a food lover who thinks her generation knows more about food than other generations. They are more interested in trying new dishes and in good service, she said. They also expect that food be \"fresh\" and come from nearby farms, if possible.\n\nThey frequently post dinner pictures and restaurant reviews online.\n\nWorking in fast food's favor is that millennials don't have that much money. Plus, fast-food restaurants are cheap.\n\nBut fast-food companies also struggle with that age group. Fast-food restaurants must offer a menu that has to entice the most customers possible. But the more items they add, the more crowded and confused the menus become.\n\n## Tough Call: Salad Or Burger\n\nAs with all trends, there are exceptions. Millennials, like all customers, demand healthy choices in surveys. But when they actually walk into a fast-food restaurant, they buy the traditional meals, such as hamburgers and fried chicken, said J.M. Owens, president of the Greater Atlanta McDonald's Operators Association.\n\n\"All of us want to do a better job on what we put in our bodies,\" he said. In reality, though, people feel healthier if they see salads on the McDonald's menu even if they walk in and buy a cheeseburger.\n\nIn a sense, that may be why Krystal ranked low in the Consumer Reports survey, said Doug Pendergast, the company's president. Krystal has salads on the menu. But hardly anyone buys them. Sales of salads make up only one-tenth of 1 percent of the total, he said.\n\n\"In our research, we have seen a trend where the average customer has asked for more healthful options,\" he said. \"However, what people say in a survey and what they purchase in an actual restaurant are two different things. About 60 percent of all customers buy at least one Krystal hamburger with their order.\" Still, Pendergast and others involved in the fast-food industry said they are taking notes. Millennials have certain things in common.\n\n## Technology Weighs In On Food Choices\n\nThey like food they can share and they are more willing to experiment with different types of food. They love snacking. They also seek out chains with a strong reputation for treating their workers well and using healthy ingredients. Chelsea Phillips, 22, said she knows the big fast-food chains have salads. But she prefers going to Moe's Southwest Grill or Panera Bread because she thinks their ingredients are healthier.\n\n\"Moe's has free-range (chicken) and that's important to me because I focus on healthy eating,\" she said. \"It's a choice for me. I can't digest what they have at fast-food restaurants because the grease makes me sick.\"\n\nMillennials are known as heavy technology users. They use phone apps that allow them to post online about what they eat. Fast-food restaurants need to show this generation that they have low-calorie options.\n\nBut Lisa Gearhart thinks millennials are more interested in flavor than in tasteless dishes that are good for them.\n\n\"Millennials are also very health conscious, but not health obsessed,\" Gearhart said. She studies millennials for a Jacksonville, Florida, company.  \"For them, dining out is as much a social experience as much as it is about fueling up.\"\n\n## It's All About Good Food\n\nAtlanta's Wing Zone runs a yearly Facebook competition. The restaurant chain asks fans what new flavors it should develop for its chicken wings, said Matt Friedman, who started the company. Millennials also want their food cooked to order. Friedman said fast-food restaurants will have to be willing to prepare food the way customers want.\n\nMcDonald's Owens said that a lot of time has been spent trying to understand what they want. But millennials want the same thing as everyone else, he said. They want \"good food that you feel good eating on a regular basis.\"'"

Most of the people didn't know each other until three months ago. Now, they were united by their anger over the death of Michael Brown, and their thankfulness for Cat Daniels, who has fed them since August.\n\nThey call her \"Momma Cat.\" She has been serving Sunday meals to protesters outside the Ferguson Police Department nearly every week since Aug. 9. On that day, Brown, an unarmed black teen, was killed by Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Last Monday, protests broke out again after a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, Wilson. A grand jury is a group of citizens who decide if a person should be charged with a crime.\n\nDaniels, 53, who lives in nearby Florissant, has tried to calm the scene with plates of food. \"Momma Cat does have quite a bit of influence,\" said Pastor Henry Logan. He is a Ferguson activist who has been working with Daniels since August. \"She does it one meal at a time.\"\n\n## \"I Can't Sit Down\"\n\nAfter months of protests, sometimes violent, the city of Ferguson seemed to take a deep breath on Thanksgiving. The protesters were gone. The holiday was cold and quiet - at least for a few hours.\n\n\"It's a day to breathe, to love one another, to share and give thanks for what we have and what we will have,\" said Daniels. She was surrounded by fried turkey, collard greens and other dishes she spent a sleepless night cooking.\n\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon shared Thanksgiving dinner with National Guard troops. He sent more than 2,000 of the soldiers to keep the city safe. West Florissant Avenue, where protesters stole and burned stores after Monday's grand jury decision, was still under guard.\n\nSome of the protesters attended a fundraiser to provide meals for poor schoolchildren.\n\nMomma Cat said she was moved to help by the unfair treatment of black people by police.\n\n\"I can't sit down. I have to be on the right side of history. But it's not my fight these days,\" Daniels said. She said that it's the fight of younger people, but she believes it's her generation's duty to support them.\n\nTo do that, Daniels turned to one thing she believes can unite any group of people, regardless of what they think or where they come from, food.\n\n## Southern-Style Comfort Food\n\nSaid Daniels, \"Food has a healing power. Food can heal your soul.\"\n\nOn most Sundays, Daniels has been behind a row of warming dishes and cooking pans in the parking lot across from the police station. She has dished out food and advice to anyone who walks up.\n\nAt first, Daniels paid for most of the food out of her pocket. As the weeks wore on, she began accepting donations from the dozens of protesters she feeds each week.\n\nDaniels has been attending classes at a cooking school, the Culinary Institute of St. Louis. She also cooks meals for doctors at DePaul Health Center in St. Louis.\n\nDaniels says her passion is cake design, although she serves up Southern-style comfort food on Sundays. Police officers have yet to walk across the street for a meal, Daniels said. But if anyone with a badge and gun joins the buffet line, she'll gladly fix them a plate.\n\nA great-grandmother, Daniels has been a mother, therapist, chef and friend to the protesters.\n\n## Keeping The Protesters Fed\n\n\"She's definitely one of the mother hens,\" said Biko Baker, a demonstrator from Milwaukee. \"When you've got 35- and 40-year-old people calling you Momma, you've done something.\"\n\nBaker said the Thanksgiving dinner served at St. Luke's AME Church came at an important time for the demonstrators. \"Momma Cat gives us an opportunity for people to come together and heal,\" Baker said.\n\nBefore, Daniels and her husband had been thinking of selling their house. They wanted to move away from the area she says is divided between black and white and rich and poor. After Brown's death, Daniels said, she knew she had to do something.\n\nMaybe she didn't belong on the front lines of the protests, but she could at least keep the protesters fed.\n\n\"I'm not a professional protester. I'm not an activist,\" Daniels said. \"We had to get active. We had to say, that's enough.\"'"

            "text": "\tNORTHAMPTON, Mass. - Audrey Olmos-Govea remembers sitting in class at Smith College and not believing what she had just heard. The teacher turned to the students and said, \"You've all been to Europe, right?\"\n\nMost of her classmates agreed, which made Olmos-Govea feel like she did not belong. She is the first one in her family to attend college, and the family lives on the $15,000 that her mother earns. Olmos-Govea, who is from Pomona, California, had flown only once in her life. For her, a trip to Europe is out of the question.\n\n\"I haven't been to Europe,\" she told the class. \"My family didn't take vacations. I worked every summer.\"\n\nThe teacher turned red and apologized, and Olmos-Govea felt embarrassed. \"But after the fact, I knew it was the right thing to do,\" she said.\n\n## Overcoming Obstacles And Odds\n\nOlmos-Govea, who is Mexican-American, overcame tremendous odds just to attend Smith. Now in her third year, she came from a town where nearly 4 out of 10 people over age 25 did not graduate from high school. The majority of them do not speak English at home. Smith is a top all-women college that costs $63,950 each year, not including books. Olmos-Govea is only able to attend because the school is helping her cover the cost with financial aid and scholarships.\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of top small schools are trying to get first-generation Americans to attend college and do well. Nationally, just 3 out of 10 students whose parents are poor and born in other countries will graduate within six years, according to the Pell Institute. The organization does research to encourage first-generation students to go to college. Usually, it is supposed to take four years to graduate. The poorest students, like Olmos-Govea, have only a 1 in 10 chance of graduating in six years.\n\nAt Smith, about 1 in 5 of this year's freshmen are first-generation students. Five years ago, the college began a program that encourages those students to connect and learn about the school before classes begin.\n\n## College President Understands\n\nMany of these small colleges understand the challenges that keep first-generation students from graduating. The schools are expensive. Students may not be prepared for the difficult classes. They might also be afraid to ask for help.\n\n\"Last year I was talking to a student who was homesick. I started talking to her like I would any other homesick student,\" said Marge Litchford, a top official at Smith, who started the program for first-generation students. \"But then I realized she wasn't going to see her parents for the whole year because she couldn't afford to fly home.\"\n\nNot long ago, about a dozen new Smith students listened to a talk given by Smith President Kathleen McCartney. The first in her family to go to college, McCartney said a high school counselor discouraged her from applying to a good college, but she applied anyway to another top school near her home.\n\nShe described the struggle of living at home and working part time while taking classes. After her talk, she tweeted a photo of the group. The students decided to call it \"Hanging with my people @smithcollege #FirstGenSmithies.\"\n\n## New Programs Help First-Gen Students\n\nAngel Perez is an official at Trinity College in Connecticut. He said that schools help first-generation students more now than when he graduated in 1998.\n\nPerez said that when he went to college, he would not have told many people that he was the first in his family to do so. \"I'm just so shocked that students are willing to talk about it so freely,\" he said.\n\nThere are not many first-generation students at the best colleges and universities, a study by the University of Michigan found.\n\nHowever, some small private colleges are trying to change that. They are making an effort to enroll and keep first-generation students, and are reporting some success. At Smith, nearly 9 out of 10 first-generation students graduate within four years. The special program for first-generation students is aimed at giving them confidence and the feeling that they belong.\n\n## Gaining Confidence\n\nRichard D. Kahlenberg is with The Century Foundation, a group that promotes equal opportunity for students to go to college. He said the country will be stronger if more leaders know what it is like to grow up in a family where the parents have not gone to college.\n\nAs a new student, Olmos-Govea did not feel very comfortable. Now she is full of confidence.\n\n\"Being here,\" Olmos-Govea said, \"has taught me how to handle myself in those situations. It hasn't made me any less scared. But Smith has taught me to question.\"\n\n'"

            "text": "\tLouis Jordan had been missing for so long, some people were certain he must have died.\n\nTwo months after he disappeared on a fishing trip off the coast of South Carolina, several memorial services had been held for him.\n\nHis family had resolved not to accept that he was dead until he had been gone for at least four months. Still, they were extremely worried.\n\nAs the weeks passed, they kept hoping he would turn up. They decided to wait at least until Easter before giving up and admitting he must be dead.\n\n## Family's Prayers Answered\n\nIn the early morning hours of the Good Friday holiday, their prayers were finally answered: Their son, weather-worn and 50 pounds thinner, walked out of a hospital and into his parents' arms.\n\n\"A lot of us didn't believe we'd see this day,\" said Glen Davis, Jordan's stepfather.\n\nJordan, 37, was spotted Thursday afternoon and rescued from his crippled boat, a 35-foot fishing vessel named Angel. He was found about 200 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.\n\nJordan left on a fishing trip from South Carolina in January, but a couple days into the trip, his boat capsized when he was caught in some rough weather. The capsizing left him with a broken shoulder.\n\n\"I was flying through the air, somersaulting, and everything was upside down and backwards,\" he said on Friday.\n\nHis boat's mast was broken and its electronic steering system was damaged. Following that incident, his boat capsized at least two more times.\n\n## Rationed His Food And Water\n\nJordan had to drain the water from the boat.\n\n\"He was doing a lot of bailing in order to keep the boat up,\" Davis said.\n\nJordan survived on some limited food on board: flour pancakes fried on a propane stove and raw fish he caught with a hand net, Davis said. He rationed his food and water, drinking just a pint a day for long stretches. To add to his limited supply of water, he collected rainwater.\n\n\"For such a long time I was so thirsty,\" he said early Friday. \"And I was almost out of water, and every day I was like, 'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water.' And finally, right before I ran out of water, finally the conditions were perfect.'\"\n\nHe read the Bible repeatedly, cover to cover, he told rescuers. A blanket from his vessel protected him from cold winds and the burning sun.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, his parents became more and more worried.\n\nIt was not uncommon for Jordan to embark on grand adventures and not call his family for days or even weeks. The family became concerned, however, after a few cold winter weeks passed without a word from him. They grew even more worried when they did not hear from him on his mother's birthday.\n\n## What Kept Him Going\n\nFamily members began heading up and down the coast, passing out fliers with Jordan's photo.\n\n\"As time went on, it got more and more hard to think he was out there and he'd survived, especially some of those cold nights,\" said Davis.\n\nOn Thursday, the family got the great news they had been hoping for. Jordan's father text-messaged them that Jordan had been found alive.\n\nJordan was rescued by a cargo ship, the Houston Express. \"They saw me on the front of my boat, standing up there waving my arms, and they turned that huge skyscraper around,\" Jordan said Friday.\n\n\"I got down onto the deck, and he walked right up to me,\" said Kyle McCollum, a rescue swimmer for the U.S. Coast Guard, who hoisted Jordan off the ship. \"He had this nice smile on his face and I could tell he was in good spirits.\"\n\nIn the helicopter, Jordan pulled out two of the things that he said had kept him going: his battered and jacket-less Bible and the blanket that had shielded him from the sun.\n\n\"As soon as we crossed over land, you could see a large smirk on his face. He was definitely eager to get out of the aircraft,\" McCollum said.\n\n## \"A Great Easter\"\n\n\"I haven't heard you in so long,\" Jordan told his father. \"I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that, you know, I was dead, and I wasn't dead.\"\n\n\"We were,\" the elder Jordan replied. \"I thought I lost you.\"\n\nBack at home in North Carolina on Friday, Jordan was looking forward to eating a nice meal and seeing family again.\n\n\"The last couple weeks really weighed heavy on us,\" Davis said. \"Now we're going to have a great Easter.\"'"

            "title": "Stars help Clinton fire up young crowds, but hipsters still \"feel the Bern\"",
            "text": "\tIOWA CITY, Iowa - Hillary Clinton has the support of many famous friends. Actress Lena Dunham and singer Katy Perry are both on her side. Demi Lovato, another singer, performed at a Clinton campaign concert at the University of Iowa.\n\nIt is a play to help the former secretary of state connect with younger voters. So far, the star power is not swaying the college set. Many say they prefer her rumpled 74-year-old rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, regardless of whether he got star power behind him or not.\n\n\"Bernie appeals more to my cool,\" said Alex Bare, 19, a University of Iowa student. Bare plans to caucus for Sanders, but said he likes Clinton and came for the free concert in Iowa City on Thursday. \"He refuses to take money from super PACs. That's a really bold move and for me, that makes him cool.\"\n\nThe push for younger voters comes during an intensifying battle for the Democratic nomination. Clinton and Sanders are locked in a tight race in Iowa. Clinton has held the lead nationally, but Sanders has a clear advantage among younger voters. \n\n## Free-Tuition Idea A Huge Hit\n\nSeveral polls are suggesting that Sanders will have about 60 percent of Democratic caucus-goers under 45\\\\. About 30 percent are expected to back Clinton.\n\n\"He has the hipster vote,\" said Erin Kelleher, 26, a graduate student at the University of Iowa. Kelleher said she was deciding between Clinton and Sanders. But she said the Lovato show would not sway her. \"I don't care about the celebrities,\" she said.\n\nSanders has collected some famous friends, too. Actress Susan Sarandon and actor Justin Long are appearing at Sanders rallies in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 1 caucus. The campaign also has several celebrities doing media outreach on Sanders' behalf. This includes hip-hop artist Killer Mike and musicians from the bands Foster the People and Vampire Weekend. Sanders is already drawing big student crowds without their help.\n\nIt is not that the students were against Clinton - they simply like what Sanders has to offer more. Students are packing his rallies by the thousands because they like his push for free tuition at public universities and his long record on liberal issues. They like that he does not take money from political action committees. They even dig his rolled-up shirt-sleeves and his grumpy grandpa attitude.\n\n## \"Confident\" At Clinton Rally\n\nMost of all, students love the slogan \"Feel the Bern.\"\n\n\"Bernie gets me stoked,\" said Ian Wold, 20, a junior at the University of Iowa. He plans to vote for Sanders in the state's kickoff caucus.\n\nThe fight for younger voters harkens back to the 2008 race, when Clinton lost the youth vote to President Barack Obama. While younger voters tend to be less reliable participants, they can make all the difference in a close race. In addition, young enthusiasm helps a candidate project strength.\n\nAbout 1,700 students came to hear Lovato and Clinton on Thursday. Backed by a small band, Lovato performed several songs, including her hit \"Confident.\" After the performance, she said, \"I don't think there's a woman more confident than Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nClinton then came on stage and spoke for about five minutes. She called Lovato an \"extraordinary young woman\" and urged the students to caucus. She drew enthusiastic applause, pledging to fight for equal rights and to \"take on those big special interests.\"\n\n## Tactic Gets Mixed Reviews\n\nSome students at the University of Iowa and at the concert were Clinton fans. Austin Graber, 22, said he thought Clinton was \"the most qualified.\" And Lauren Ellbogen, 18, said she would be working at the caucuses for Clinton and said she didn't think Sanders was \"realistic.\"\n\nHuge numbers of young people turned out to rallies for Sanders on college campuses in eastern Iowa over the weekend. More than 2,000 people came to hear Sanders at Luther College in Decorah on Sunday morning. Decked out in \"Feel the Bern\" shirts, students screamed and cheered when Sanders touted his lack of a super PAC and pledged to provide free tuition at public universities. The crowds chanted: \"Bernie, Bernie, Bernie,\" and frequently yelled \"We love you Bernie.\"\n\nCelebrities have been campaigning for Clinton for months. Pop starlet Katy Perry performed at a Clinton rally in Des Moines, Iowa, in October. Actress Lena Dunham toured Iowa and New Hampshire and did events in Boston and Chicago for Clinton this month.\n\nMany students said the Lovato concert was a good move for Clinton, but they were not all convinced. Jen Moulton, 18, leans to Sanders. She said the concert was \"kind of cool, but it comes off like she's trying really hard.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - On Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she will be running for the office of president of the United States. The campaign will be her second attempt to become president.\n\n\"Everyday Americans need a champion. I want to be that champion,\" she said.\n\n## Hitting The Road For Votes\n\nClinton made her announcement in a video. She now plans to do a tour of a few states to connect with voters directly. She will visit coffee shops, day care centers and some people's homes.\n\n\"So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote. Because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey,\" Clinton said at the end of the video.\n\nClinton was secretary of state during President Barack Obama's first term. She is also a former senator and, as the wife of President Bill Clinton, a former first lady.\n\nIf elected, she will concentrate on helping the middle class and working families, she said. Finding jobs that pay well has been hard nowadays, but Americans have fought back against tough times, she said.\n\nHowever, she said \"the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.\"\n\nClinton said it doesn't have to be that way: \"So you can do more than just get by. You can get ahead and stay ahead. Because when families are strong, America is strong.\"\n\nStill, some fellow Democrats worry that Clinton might not really do enough to help the middle class if she becomes president. They have urged her to raise taxes on the wealthy and make tougher rules for banks and Wall Street.\n\n## Republicans Quick To Attack\n\nRepublicans did not wait for Clinton's announcement to begin their campaign against her. The party's leader, Reince Priebus, said she is too much like Obama, who is very unpopular with Republicans. Clinton's election would be like giving Obama a \"third term,\" Priebus said.\n\nRepublicans have attacked Clinton for using a personal email account while she was secretary of state. They claim it allowed her to hide some of her mistakes. They have also heavily criticized her handling of the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed a U.S. ambassador.\n\nOn Sunday, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said that Obama and Clinton made the enemies of the United States stronger. Bush is expected to run to become the Republican candidate for the presidency.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, also criticized Clinton. He pointed to the Clinton family's foundation, which he said took money from other countries when it should not have. The foundation was created to raise money for good causes.\n\nPaul said the foundation should not have accepted money from Saudi Arabia, where women are not allowed to drive.\n\nClinton claims to be a strong supporter of women's rights, so she should have turned down Saudi money, Paul said. \"Instead, she's accepting tens of millions of dollars.\"\n\n## Not The Only Democrat Out There\n\nClinton is the first Democrat to get into the race. However, there are some less-known Democrats who are considering challenging her. They include former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee.\n\nClinton must first win in the primaries, in which she will run against other Democrats. If she wins, she will then run against a Republican in the general election.\n\nSo far, Clinton seems likely to become the Democratic candidate in the general election.\n\nWhen it comes to winning the presidency, however, history may be against her. Americans do not seem to want one party to control the White House for too long. Only once in the last 50 years has the same party held the White House for three terms in a row, and Obama has already served two terms.\n\nThe 2016 campaign is likely to be the most expensive in history. Total spending on both sides is expected to go well beyond the $1 billion spent during the last election four years ago. This weekend, Clinton campaign fundraisers began calling wealthy supporters. They urged those supporters to give money to Clinton's campaign as soon as possible.'"

            "text": "\tDENVER - On Wednesday in suburban Denver, around 1,000 high schoolers took part in a large student demonstration. They had turned out to oppose a new set of high school history standards. The standards had recently been proposed by the area's school board.\n\nMost of the young protesters gathered at a busy street corner. They chanted \"Education without limitation!\" and waved signs and American flags.\n\nThe afternoon demonstration lasted about three hours. It was directed against a plan to make sure that history classes promote patriotism and respect for authority.\n\nLater, about 75 students from Alameda International High School walked out after meeting with Jefferson County School Superintendent Dan McMinimee. They had met to discuss the proposed standards.\n\n## Honesty In History\n\nThe standards the students object to were proposed by Jefferson County school board member Julie Williams. She is a conservative, meaning that she supports traditional attitudes and values. Many conservatives believe some school textbooks are too critical of America. They believe that reading such material will change students' thinking. Students, they fear, will read negative stories about America, then become rebellious. They fear that students will no longer feel proud of their country.\n\nWilliams' plan comes in response to a change in how history is taught in schools across the country. The Advanced Placement (AP) history test, which is given nationally, has changed. In response, classes that prepare students to take the test must also change.\n\nSupporters of the new approach to AP history say it will lead to a more balanced view. Both sides of the story should be heard, they say. What's more, honesty about our country's problems and mistakes is a good thing.\n\nConservatives like Williams fear the new approach would be too focused on the nation's problems. Under Williams' plan, a committee would review all AP history readings. It would make sure that classroom materials promote patriotism and \"respect for authority.\"\n\n## \"Out Here For The Right Reasons\"\n\nSo far, the district has not tried to stop student demonstrators. \"We're going to allow students to make their concerns heard,\" district spokeswoman Lynn Setzer said.\n\nSchool officials have been sent to watch over the demonstrations to make sure students stay safe.\n\nAt Wednesday's large afternoon protest, students gathered peacefully as police and school officials looked on. The majority of the students came from two high schools, Chatfield and Dakota Ridge.\n\n\"There are kids here\" just to skip class, student organizer Scott Romano said. \"But the majority of us are out here for the right reasons.\"\n\nThe protests began on Friday, before students joined in. Teachers staged a so-called \"sick out\" by taking sick days at the same time, causing two schools to shut down.\n\nStudents began walking out of classes in waves on Monday. Hundreds of students from at least six area schools have taken part so far.\n\nThe dozens of students who left Alameda International High School asked McMinimee about the school board plan. McMinimee said he was worried that students have not been fully informed.\n\nStudents, he said, \"don't necessarily have the whole picture.\"'"

            "text": "\tSIMFEROPOL, Ukraine - In an act condemned by the West, Russia seized Crimea and its naval port on Tuesday.\n\nThis came two days after Crimean citizens voted to separate from Ukraine and join Russia. If Russia does not give the Crimea back to Ukraine, it will change the map of Europe.\n\nMeanwhile on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed agreements with Crimea's pro-Russian leaders. The agreements give Crimea over to Russia. The signing ceremony was held in the grand St. George's Hall in the Kremlin, a historic fortress in Moscow. Shortly before, Putin gave a heated hour-long speech. It was greeted by applause from the joyful crowd.\n\nPutin said the decision to take over Crimea was based on the Crimean people's \"free expression of the will.\" In a popular vote on Sunday, more than 96 percent of Crimeans supported rejoining Russia.  Russia controlled Crimea until 1954 when the leader of the Soviet Union transferred it to Ukraine, and many Russians still live in Crimea. Ukraine gained independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union fell.\n\n## The West Threatens Punishments\n\nIn February, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine. He escaped following months of violent protests against his government that left many people dead. Yanukovych was pro-Russian, while the new government that took over is pro-West. Late last month, Russian soldiers, wearing unmarked uniforms, marched in and took control of Crimea.\n\nIn his speech, Putin blamed Ukraine's new leaders for the invasion. He called them names - \"nationalists, Russophobes and anti-Semites.\" A Ukrainian nationalist is a patriot, while a Russophobe is a person who is anti-Russian, and an anti-Semite is someone who hates Jews.\n\nPutin claimed that Russia went into Crimea at the request of its citizens. Putin would not admit that Russian soldiers actually invaded Crimea weeks before the vote. Putin referred to his soldiers as Crimean \"self-defense forces.\"\n\n\"Esteemed residents of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, all of Russia admires your (endurance), dignity and courage,\" he said in the televised speech. Sevastopol is the port in Crimea where the Russia navy's Black Sea Fleet is based. The port is vitally important to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the countries of the European Union have joined to condemn Russia for breaking international law. They have stopped the bank accounts of some Russian officials to pressure Russia into leaving Crimea. They are threatening further punishments.\n\n## Russia Will React, Putin Says\n\nPutin said that the West is threatening Russia. And Russia will react.\n\nBut he promised that Russia will not fight against Western countries. He said that Russia will do its best to build good relations with its neighbors and other countries.\n\nPutin also insisted that Russia would not invade more of Ukraine. Like Crimea, Ukraine's southeast has a large Russian-speaking population. He told the Ukrainian people that Russia has \"always\" respected the unity of Ukraine. \"Don't trust those who scare you with Russia,\" he said.\n\nThat said, Putin suggested that southeastern Ukraine was historically part of Russian.\n\nThe Soviet Union broke up in 1991. This left some Russians in newly independent lands, including Ukraine. Putin once called the breakup of the Soviet Union the biggest disaster of the 20th century.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Putin called Ukraine's new government unlawful. He said they were not worth talking to.\n\n## Blames The West\n\nPutin blamed the U.S. and Western Europe for the takeover. He said they encouraged the protests in Ukraine that forced out the president. He said the U.S. and Western European countries had \"crossed the line in the case of Ukraine.\"\n\nPutin said, \"They acted roughly, irresponsibly and unprofessionally. They knew quite well millions of Russians live in Ukraine and Crimea.\" Putin said the U.S. and Western Europe should have known that Russia would grab Crimea if they supported the new government in Ukraine. Before the Ukrainian president fled, the Ukrainian government was very pro-Russian.\n\n\"Today it is necessary to stop the (panic) ... and recognize the obvious thing that Russia is an independent and active participant in the international life. And like other countries it has its national interests which should be taken into account and respected,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin promised that all of Crimea's ethnic groups would be respected. Three main groups share Crimea - Russians, Ukrainians and Tatars, who originally ruled the area. He also said the region would have three state languages, Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar.\n\n\"Crimea is ... under the strong and stable (rule) which today in fact can be only Russian,\" he said.'"

He then founded Young Georgians in Government and persuaded state legislators to introduce a bill to lower the age at which someone can run for state government.\n\nNow, C.J. is reaching out to other fans of Cruz. He would like other politically minded youngsters to help him build a national network. They'll use Twitter and Instagram to promote the senator.\n\nAnd those teens can then lean on the voters they interact with every day.\n\nC.J. said Cruz has a natural appeal to teens: He drives elders crazy.\n\n\"He's a bold person. He's really someone who's led on issues and stood up to everyone,\" said C.J., comparing Cruz to current Republican front-runner Donald Trump. \"That's something a lot of young teenagers are looking for.\"\n\nCruz said something similar recently when he announced that C.J. would become the leader of Teens for Ted.\n\n## Hoping To Ride The Coattails Of A Teenage Role Model\n\n\"Young people are looking for someone who does more than just talk a good game. They want someone who has walked the walk,\" said Cruz, recalling his 2013 fight against increasing the federal government's borrowing limit, which he ultimately lost. \"They're looking for a fighter. But most importantly, they're looking for someone who cares.\"\n\nC.J. said he also appreciates Cruz's willingness to get a little silly. Once, he twirled around in the name of freedom for the news and entertainment website BuzzFeed. Another time, he cooked bacon on the barrel of a machine gun for a site called IJ Review.\n\nAfter meeting Cruz at a state party convention, C.J. contacted someone in the Cruz campaign about getting involved.\n\nC.J.'s network can help Cruz stand out to voters in a crowded Republican field, said Tyler, the Cruz campaign spokesman. If speeches and ads don't have an effect on voters, their children or younger siblings might.\n\n\"The message is, 'I am the future and the future is in your hands, and I'm really encouraging you to vote for Ted Cruz,'\" Tyler said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The United States ended all contact with Cuba in 1961. This week, President Barack Obama cleared the way for rebuilding normal relations between the two countries.\n\nIn a message to Congress, Obama said he plans to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The list is made up of counties that provide support for terrorism. The decision also recognizes that Cuba no longer is promoting revolution in Latin America or trying to overthrow governments in other countries.\n\n## Promises Were Made\n\nLast December, Obama and Cuban President Ra\\xc3\\xbal Castro promised to move toward normal relations.\n\nCongress has 45 days to consider Cuba's removal from the list. Lawmakers would need to take a vote if they want to keep Cuba on the list. The Obama government thinks that is not likely.\n\nObama said many Americans approve of his plan to fix the relationship with Cuba.\n\nDiplomatic ties with Cuba were broken after the communist revolution. The government overthrow brought Fidel Castro, Raul Castro's brother, to power. Under communism, the government owns all property and people have few freedoms. Cuba was first put on the state terrorism list in 1982. At the time, Cuba tried to spread communism and stir up revolutions in other countries, particularly in Latin America.\n\n\"Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said. He is the leader of the State Department, which manages the United States' relations with other countries.\n\n## There Are Still Policy Disagreements\n\nThere are still many problems in Latin America, including corruption, violence and drugs. However, Cuba is the only country in Latin America that does not have a democratic government elected by its citizens. Also, most of the violent revolutions in the area ended long ago.\n\nIf Cuba is taken off the terror list, only three countries remain. They are Iran, Sudan and Syria.\n\nJosefina Vidal is the director of U.S. relations at Cuba's Foreign Ministry. She said the decision to take Cuba off the list is fair. She added that Cuba never deserved to be on it in the first place.\n\nShe said Cuba rejects terrorism. Cuba also is against anything that encourages, supports, pays for, or helps terrorists.\n\nObama told Congress that Cuba is not currently supporting international terrorism. Cuba also has promised not to support it in the future.\n\nKerry said that the United States disagrees with many of Cuba's policies and actions. But these are not considered terrorism under American law.\n\n## Ambassadors Would Move In Again\n\nU.S. officials said that full normalization of relations with Cuba could take years.\n\nThe two countries would open embassies and exchange ambassadors, who serve as official representatives. Currently, trade and travel to Cuba is limited.\n\nCongress passed the trade and travel rules to pressure Cuba to end communism. Only Congress can lift the rules, but the president has the power to establish diplomatic relations.\n\nBefore the announcement, high-level Cuban and U.S. officials held three rounds of talks. Cuba had demanded that the United States take it off the terror list. For Cuba's part, the United States said that U.S. officials must be able to freely move around the island. Also, Cuban citizens could not be kept from entering the U.S. Embassy.\n\nA country on the terrorism list cannot buy weapons from the United States or receive economic help.\n\n## American Ideas And Trade Could Help\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois helped reach the agreement with Cuba. He said that he is not a fan of Castro's government. But opening up Cuba to American ideas and trade is the best way \"to see a more open and tolerant Cuba,\" he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees with Obama's decision. Opponents in Congress were led by Cuban-American Senators Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida. Rubio is a candidate for president. They are against having a normal relationship with Cuba.\n\nIn the past, several Americans fled to Cuba to escape criminal charges in the United States. The senators argue that Cuba should not be taken off the list until it sends them back.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain of Arizona agrees that Cuba should return the fugitives. \"It might be a nice gesture,\" he said. \"but it's not going to happen.\"'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK, N.Y. - Workers from McDonald's, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurant chains protested nationwide Tuesday. They demanded that they be paid at least $15 an hour.\n\nThe protesters also had a message for the men and women now running to become president of the United States: Support their cause or lose their vote next year.\n\nThe protests were part of a campaign called \"Fight for $15.\" The larger goal of that campaign is to get the nationwide minimum wage raised to $15 an hour.\n\nA minimum wage is the least amount of money per hour an employer is legally allowed to pay. There are both local and national minimum wages.\n\n## Increase Would Apply To All Low-wage Workers\n\nThe increase fast-food workers are seeking would not just apply to them. It would benefit all low-wage employees across the country.\n\nThe fast-food protests took place in more than 270 cities nationwide. Janitors, nursing home workers and package delivery workers joined some protests.\n\nDominique McCrae joined a protest outside a McDonald's in Durham, North Carolina. McCrae, who is 23, serves fried chicken and biscuits at a Bojangles' restaurant for $7.55 an hour. She said she dropped out of college to care for her grandfather. Her pay is not enough to both cover her rent and properly care for her child, she said.\n\n\"We just want to be able to support our families,\" McCrae said.\n\nBojangles' said its wages are better than what many similar companies offer.\n\n## Some Candidates Agree With Protesters\n\nThe \"Fight for $15\" campaign began about three years ago. Several past protests also took place outside fast-food restaurants.\n\nThis time workers are pledging not to vote for presidential candidates who do not support the campaign. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both expressed their support. Sanders also showed up at a protest outside the Senate in Washington. The Democrats and Republicans are the two main parties in the ongoing presidential elections.\n\nMcDonald's worker Adriana Alvarez said she plans to vote for the first time next year. She said she will only vote for a candidate who wants to raise wages to $15 an hour. Alvarez, who is 23 and lives in Chicago, makes $10.50 an hour. Higher pay would help her move out of the moldy basement apartment she shares with her 3-year-old son, she said.\n\n\"I can find a better place,\" she said.\n\n## Minimum Wage Debate Continues To Rage\n\nThe average restaurant worker earns $11.51 an hour. However, chain restaurants like McDonald's or Taco Bell often pay far less.\n\nExperts have long disagreed about the wisdom of raising the minimum wage. Some claim that wage hikes only end up hurting workers. They say that if they have to pay higher wages, they will have to fire some workers. Other experts say raising the minimum can do a lot to help workers and their families.\n\nRecent research has found that small wage increases seldom lead to many lost jobs. However, a jump to $15 an hour would more than double the national minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour. Such a jump would be the highest increase ever. For that reason, most experts are unsure about what might happen.\n\nOn Tuesday, McDonald's said wages at the U.S. restaurants it owns are now $1 over the local minimum wage. However, most U.S. McDonald's locations are independently owned and run. Wages in those restaurants are not set by the parent company but by the local owner.\n\n## Companies Say They Have Limited Control\n\nRival Burger King said it supports \"the right to demonstrate.\" It added that it hopes \"any demonstrators will respect the safety of our restaurant guests and employees.\" The company also said that many of its restaurants are independently operated. Owners of those restaurants set wages, not the parent company.\n\nYum Brands is behind both Taco Bell and KFC. It said workers for the two restaurant chains are paid above minimum wage. However, that is only true for the 2,000 restaurants the company owns. The other restaurants are independently operated and wages are set by individual owners.\n\nAt a New York rally, a few hundred people cheered and clapped.\n\nSome at the rally were not fast-food workers. Liz Henry, 38, works at a New York hospital. She said she makes more than $15 per hour but supports the effort for other workers.\n\n\"Even what I'm making right now is not even enough,\" she says. \"How do they really get by? It's hard.\"'"

            "text": "\tCLAYTON, Mo. - Lawyers for Michael Brown's family on Thursday said the family supports Missouri Governor Jay Nixon's call for calm once the grand jury announces its decision. By the end of November it will decide whether to indict the Ferguson police officer who shot the teen. An indictment means the police officer will be put on trial.\n\nThe lawyers also said the governor's appeal should have been aimed at police as well.\n\nAnthony D. Gray, a Brown family lawyer, repeated the governor's call against \"looting and rioting.\"\n\nGray added: \"Law enforcement should have been equally condemned by the governor for this conduct.\" He said that a \"strong message of zero tolerance\" should have been made toward everybody.\n\n## Demonstrations Were Emotional\n\nBrown, 18, was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. His death was followed by both peaceful demonstrations as well as looting and violence. Many fear that the earlier unrest is only a taste of what's to come if the grand jury investigating the case decides not to indict Wilson. The lawyers for Brown's family said they do not trust the grand jury. It is made up of average citizens, yet holds its hearings in secret.\n\nAnother lawyer for the Brown family, Benjamin Crump, said Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch had too much control over the grand jury. McCulloch is a lawyer for the St. Louis government.\n\n\"The grand jury will do whatever the prosecutor wants them to do,\" he said. \"This has always been about what evidence he presents and how he presents it.\"\n\n## Learning From The August Protests\n\nCrump told reporters he wanted to thank police \"in advance\" for \"not having a repeat of the horrific encounters that took place in August.\" He said that police sometimes went too far. They violated the rights of peaceful protesters and the media, he said.\n\nCrump said Nixon's job as governor is to ensure laws are enforced equally. Gray said police need to use \"reasonable\" actions when dealing with demonstrators.\n\n\"History is clear,\" Gray said. Demonstrators who were \"simply exercising their First Amendment rights\" became \"victims of assault rifles being pointed in their face, being manhandled, being tear-gassed, hit by rubber bullets, falsely arrested.\" These actions came before the demonstrators acted \"uncivilized,\" he said.\n\nCrump and Gray spoke less than an hour after Dr. Michael Baden entered the courthouse to testify before the grand jury. Baden is a nationally known medical expert. He examined Brown's body for his family.\n\nCrump criticized the grand jury's secrecy. He insisted that Wilson should have been charged by prosecutors long ago in the \"shooting of an unarmed teenager.\"\n\n## \"Remain Vigilant Yet Peaceful\"\n\nBrown's parents were in Switzerland early in the week to talk to the United Nations. They did not attend the Thursday news conference in Clayton.\n\nGray said that the parents wanted Brown's supporters \"to remain vigilant yet peaceful, calm and dignified.\"\n\nBut soon, Gray and Crump turned their attention to Nixon.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nixon talked about how police are preparing for what might come after the grand jury's decision. His office and law enforcement want to keep residents and businesses safe while allowing protesters to exercise their rights after the grand jury's decision is announced, he said.\n\nNixon said he had yet to call up the Missouri National Guard. Still, the guard was \"available if we determine it is necessary,\" he said.\n\nNixon was joined by Jon Belmar, the St. Louis County police chief.\n\nBelmar said the possibility of lives lost as a result of civil unrest keeps him up at night. It was remarkable, he said, that no one died, or was seriously injured, during the height of the protests over Brown's death in August.\n\nProtesters repeatedly have asked Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case. They say McCulloch is too close to the St. Louis police department. The governor has refused their request.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - More Republicans are jumping into the race for president. These are people who oppose President Barack Obama's Democratic Party. Carly Fiorina is a former technology official. Ben Carson used to work as a brain surgeon. Both have announced they're running for president, and both believe they can help their party win support from voters in different communities.\n\nFiorina is likely to be the only well-known woman to run for president as a Republican. Carson is likely to be the only African American. Neither of them has worked in government before. They will be competing with people who've worked in government for a long time.\n\nFiorina, 60, chose a national morning news show to announce her candidacy. She also posted a video.\n\n## Fiorina Says She's Good At Decisions\n\nThe former leader of Hewlett-Packard, a technology company, appeared on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" She said she knows how to make important decisions.\n\nShe also criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is leading in the Democratic race for president. The Republican and Democratic groups oppose each other on many issues. Fiorina said Clinton is not open enough about her activities. As an example, she said Clinton should not have used a private email account while she was secretary of state. As secretary of state, Clinton was in charge of the United States' relationships with other countries.\n\n\"I have a lot of admiration for Hillary Clinton, but she clearly is not trustworthy,\" Fiorina said.\n\nCarson revealed his plans to run in an interview that aired Sunday on an Ohio television station.\n\n\"I'm willing to be part of the equation and therefore, I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America,\" he said.\n\nCarson, 63, made his formal announcement Monday in a speech from his native Detroit. He spoke shortly after having breakfast at a local museum of African-American history.\n\n## Others Have More Experience In Politics\n\nBoth candidates are entering the race as underdogs. It means, at this point, they are unlikely to win. They are expected to run against several people who are experienced in politics, including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. These men have received a lot of attention and have gotten money for their campaigns. But the race is still wide open, and as many as two dozen major candidates could eventually decide to run.\n\nThe Republican field is already more varied than it was four years ago. Rubio and Cruz are each trying to become the first Hispanic president. And most of the candidates are young compared to previous presidents.\n\nStill, the Republican National Committee, which manages the Republican Party, says it wants to attract a new kind of supporter. A lot of the party's members are older, white men. The party wants more women and ethnic minorities like Hispanics and African-Americans. President Obama won re-election in 2012 with the strong support of these groups.\n\n## Carson Comes From Detroit\n\nCarson was raised in Detroit by a single mother. He worked as a doctor for almost 30 years. He gained national attention in politics after criticizing Obama's health care law.\n\nHe has strong support from people in the group known as the tea party. They support traditional views. Some of them tried to push Carson into the race before he even decided to run himself.\n\nYet he has made some mistakes while in the political spotlight. Once, he suggested that Obama's health care law was the worst thing since slavery. Another time, he compared present-day America to Nazi Germany. And once, he called problems at the nation's Veterans Affairs hospitals \"a gift from God\" because they uncovered difficulties in the way the country cares for people who have served in the military.\n\nFiorina, meanwhile, has a background more likely to draw Republican support. The former business leader became a well-known figure in Republican politics in 2010, when she ran for Senate in California and lost to Senator Barbara Boxer by 10 points.\n\nBoth Carson and Fiorina will be touring states that have early voting.\n\nCarson was scheduled to spend the first few days of his presidential campaign in Iowa. He will head to South Carolina at the end of the week and New Hampshire and Nevada next week.\n\nFiorina's first public event is scheduled for Tuesday in New York City. She also plans to campaign in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina by week's end.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - When a president leaves office, what happens to his belongings? It would seem wrong if he just packed up and threw everything away. The papers, photos and records of a president's work are interesting to the public and historians alike. But where does everything get stored?\n\nThe answer is at the presidential library. When a president leaves office, a library is built to preserve everything from his time in the White House that is important to history. These libraries are open to visitors, allowing people to examine the history of American presidents up close.\n\nModern presidential libraries are not just concerned with presidents. The libraries also show the work and lives of presidents' wives, traditionally known as \"first ladies.\"\n\nExhibits have started to display first ladies' achievements alongside their husbands'. This recognizes the important work that first ladies do. It also helps capture the partnership between the president and first lady.\n\n## First Ladies Work Hard As Well\n\nIt makes sense that presidential libraries document first ladies' lives and work. Many of these women actually lead the way in planning and constructing the libraries.\n\nThe current first lady, Michelle Obama, is a good example. As her husband's time in office winds down, she will help plan his library. There are a number of decisions to be made, and work to be done. She will work to make sure the library turns out how she and her husband imagine it.\n\nThe library will also include records of Michelle Obama's work while she was first lady. In particular, it will highlight her work in public service. One of her most famous public service projects is the \"Let's Move\" program, which helps children with their nutrition and health.\n\nMichelle Obama is not the only first lady to be involved in a presidential library.\n\nFirst lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is featured in the library of her husband, President Bill Clinton. An exhibit called \"Putting People First\" highlights her efforts to improve health care for Americans. Another exhibit focusing on education includes several awards that she received.\n\nFirst lady Laura Bush played a big part in planning President George W. Bush's library. Before she lived at the White House, she was a librarian, so she had a lot of ideas for her husband's library. She helped choose where it would be built and how it should look.\n\n## Their Own Important Place In History\n\nThe history of first ladies and presidential libraries goes back much further. In fact, it was first lady Sarah Polk who set up the first-ever presidential library.\n\nIn 1849, President James Polk left office because of his failing health. He died soon after, and his wife Sarah collected his papers, paintings and belongings. She put them in a small room where they could be viewed by the public.\n\nMany other first ladies, including Nancy Reagan, Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, were involved with their husband's libraries.\n\nOf all the first ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy may have played the largest part in the construction of her husband's library. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. After his sudden death, the entire job of establishing his library fell to his wife.\n\nShe devoted herself to the project. \"She was responsible for fundraising, choosing the architect, developing the exhibits and choosing which of the president's personal objects would go on display,\" said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a historian at the National First Ladies' Library.\n\nToday, first ladies are as involved as ever in the planning of presidential libraries. They are involved in other ways, too. First ladies have helped presidents shape and talk about their goals. Some have served as examples of good character for the American people. Others have fought for a cause they believe in.\n\nPresidential libraries, in other words, are just some of the many projects that first ladies work on. The libraries, in turn, help us remember their important place in history.'"

            "text": "\tENGLEWOOD, N.J. - Gerald Marion has spent his whole life fighting fires, not racial injustice.\n\nThe Englewood resident rose through the ranks to become the city's second black fire chief, earning a reputation as a calm, steadfast advocate for his department who stayed out of the political fray.\n\nBut Marion reached a breaking point over the case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. who followed Martin, an unarmed black teenager. The two got in a fight and Zimmerman shot Martin, who died of his wound. A six-woman Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty in the death.\n\nAfter the jury's decision came out, the fire chief stepped into the debate about race and justice. He asked the City Council to do no business with companies in Florida and other states with stand-your-ground laws. The laws say people are not legally required to try to run away before defending themselves if they believe someone is trying to kill or seriously harm them.\n\n\"I've never been an activist,\" the 46-year-old said. \"I'm fed up. It should not be a law that you get to murder because you're uncomfortable.\"\n\n## Putting Pressure On Florida\n\nMarion said stand-your-ground laws hurt blacks more than other races. Especially when police and others assume black youths are criminals, while white youths get the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"We read the news every day and you're always coming across a story ... an African-American gets shot because the shooter was threatened by their presence or the shooter was reacting to a stereotype,\" he said. \"It could be me. It could be my son. It could be my nephew.\"\n\nMarion may be the first public official in Bergen County, if not New Jersey, to ask a local government to shun Florida businesses in the wake of the verdict. But he is not the only one calling for a boycott of the Sunshine State. There is a widespread desire to pressure Florida business leaders to lean on state lawmakers to get rid of the self-defense law.\n\nSinger Stevie Wonder said he would no longer perform in Florida or other states with stand-your-ground laws. More than 10,000 people have signed a series of online petitions on Moveon.org calling for a Florida boycott. Social media users on Twitter have encouraged rejecting Florida products with hash tags such as #boycottflorida and #notflorida.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is considering a boycott of the state, said Anthony Cureton, president of the Bergen County chapter. Cureton is an Englewood police officer who grew up with Marion. He said he understood the fire chief's frustration and what is driving his actions.\n\n\"I share the same position,\" Cureton said. \"He has belief in this. He doesn't hold back when there's something he's passionate about. I stand with him on that point.\"\n\n## \"Not One Taxpayer Dollar\"\n\nAt the City Council meeting, Marion said the Fire Department would \"not spend one taxpayer dollar\" on equipment made in Florida. The department has for years purchased its trucks and much of its equipment from E-ONE, a company based in Ocala, Fla.\n\nHe said his predecessors bought trucks and equipment from the company so that the fleet would have uniform equipment. But he said companies in New York and Wisconsin sell quality fire apparatus as well as trucks, which cost $350,000 to $750,000. The chief told council members that the boycott would allow him to \"sleep with a clear conscience.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a target anymore,\" he said. \"And I want someone to help. And that has to start with us.\"\n\nBut Marion and other officials who agree with his stand may not be able to help. Legally, they are not allowed to boycott a state's companies when accepting bids for goods and services.\n\nNew Jersey's law does not allow favoring one company over another when the towns are seeking goods and services, said Bill Dressel, the executive director of the New Jersey association of cities.\n\n\"Local governments must follow state law,\" he said.\n\n## Disgust Over Stand-Your-Ground\n\nDressel said state lawmakers could alter the law. They did years ago in banning purchases from South Africa when it was under apartheid, a system that separated blacks and whites. Those laws were overturned two decades ago by a movement led by Nelson Mandela.\n\nEnglewood has just one current contract with a Florida-based company. It was hired in May to put together an online list of vacant properties. The company was the only one that applied to do the project, City Manager Timothy Dacey said in an email.\n\nEnglewood City Councilman Eugene Skurnick said he would support a Florida boycott. He added he would like to see a wider boycott of towns and cities in New Jersey and other states where there have been racially controversial fatal shootings.\n\nCouncilman Marc Forman used strong language in expressing his disgust of stand-your-ground. He described the laws as \"an abomination.\" But he wasn't sure a boycott was the right course of action.\n\n\"I mean, we are the United States,\" he said, \"and Florida is not the only state with stand-your-ground laws.\"'"

More than 680 Palestinians and 34 Israelis have been killed in the 2-week-long war.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State John Kerry, flew to Israel Wednesday. He reported progress in efforts to end fighting.\n\nNeither side, however, appeared to be backing down. Palestinian rocket fire led several international airlines to halt flights to Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Israeli troops clashed with Hamas near the Gaza town of Khan Younis, where fighting forced dozens of families to flee.\n\nHamas leader Khaled Mashaal later demanded Gaza's borders be allowed to open. He called Palestinians \"the true owners of the land.\" Hamas has ruled over Gaza's 1.7 million people since 2007.\n\nThe Palestinians are seeking their own country. They and the Israelis have been negotiating - and fighting - over the land for decades.\n\n## Secretary Of State Is Working On It\n\nIsrael insists it must stop the ability of Hamas to launch attacks. The U.S. government seems to increasingly support Israel's position.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration banned flights into Israel Tuesday. A day earlier, a Hamas rocket landed near the main airport. Even so, Secretary of State Kerry flew into Tel Aviv Wednesday, showing his determination to end the fighting.\n\nHe met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier, he held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon, who is also in the region.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Kerry said negotiations toward a Gaza cease-fire were making some progress. \"We certainly have made steps forward,\" Kerry said. \"There's still work to be done.\"\n\nOn the ground, meanwhile, Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters near Khan Younis. The Israelis were backed by tanks and drones; the Palestinians were armed with rocket-propelled grenades and attack rifles. At least eight militants died, a Palestinian health official said.\n\n## People Seek Shelter In Schools\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent, which is part of the International Red Cross, was trying to evacuate some 250 people from the area.\n\nHundreds of residents of Khan Younis were seen fleeing their homes as the battle unfolded. They said they were seeking shelter in nearby U.N. schools.\n\n\"The airplanes and airstrikes are all around us,\" said Aziza Msabah, a resident of Khan Younis. \"They are hitting the houses, which are collapsing upon us.\"\n\nFarther north, the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City saw intense fighting earlier this week. An airstrike destroyed a home, killing 30-year-old journalist Abdul Rahman Abu Hean, his grandfather and nephew.\n\nMeanwhile, a foreign worker in Israel was killed when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in southern Israel on Wednesday, police said. The worker's nationality was unknown.\n\nIsrael said five more of its soldiers have died in the conflict, bringing the military's death toll to 32. Two Israeli civilians have been killed in 15 days of fighting.\n\n## Both Sides Get A Warning\n\nIn Jerusalem, 30,000 people attended the funeral of Max Steinberg, a 24-year-old from Southern California serving in the Israeli military. Steinberg was killed in an attack on Sunday.\n\n\"I spoke with him a day and a half ago,\" his mother, Evie Steinberg, told Israeli TV. \"I said 'are you afraid?' He said 'no. I am afraid only for you.' He's a hero.\"\n\nThe Palestinians say Israel is not being careful in its use of modern weapons in Gaza. The Palestinian death toll stands at 684, mostly civilians, said Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra.\n\nIsrael says it launched the Gaza operation to halt Hamas rocket fire into Israel - more than 2,100 rockets have been fired since the conflict erupted.\n\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, meanwhile, warned both sides against targeting civilians and said war crimes may have been committed.\n\nShe noted an Israeli bombing that killed three children and wounded two others while they were playing on the roof of their home.\n\n\"There seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes,\" Pillay told the 47-nation U.N. Human Rights Council. She said such incidents should be investigated.'"

            "title": "In German town rebuilt by Allies, \"neo-Nazis\" drive out new war refugees",
            "text": "\tTROEGLITZ, Germany - Some people in the town of Troeglitz, Germany, do not want people fleeing from wars in other countries, or refugees, coming there to live. These people are called \"neo-Nazis,\" because they are said to be acting like the Germans who ran the country in World War II. Neo-Nazis scared the mayor into quitting his job this year. They also burned down a shelter for refugees. The events happened 70 years after Allied bombers reduced much of the thousand-year-old village to rubble.\n\nLocal historians and refugee supporters think this is a strange twist. They note that in 1944, bombers fighting on the side of the United States and Russia bombed the village. The people who crawled from the rubble 70 years ago received an enormous amount of help to put their lives back together. That help came from the United States and Russia. People in those countries had every right to see the people living in Nazi Germany as the worst people ever.\n\nBut the aid came. It helped locals rebuild their lives.\n\n## Anti-Refugee Marches And A Fire\n\nNow, thousands of would-be refugees, fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa, are boarding boats to reach Europe. But many Europeans aren't welcoming them, even as hundreds die trying to get here.\n\nLike many smaller German communities, Troeglitz was under instructions to prepare to host a few dozen war refugees. But the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), a political party, started protesting. The NPD are seen as neo-Nazis and are trying to influence the German government. They began organizing anti-refugee marches in several places, and the crowds grew.\n\nIn March, the mayor of Troeglitz, Markus Nierth, quit. He said he'd been receiving threats that made continuing in his job impossible.\n\nThen on April 4, the building being fixed up to house the refugees was destroyed by fire. Police quickly decided that the fire was set on purpose and blamed supporters of the NPD.\n\n## Pro-Refugee Supporters Outnumbered\n\nMatthias Keilholz started a group to support refugees. He found the problems in the town saddening.\n\nAt the end of that World War II, one in five people who lived in Troeglitz were considered to be refugees, he said. \"And yet now, when others need this same help, many here not only turn their backs, but threaten others who offer help.\"\n\nOf course, it's not just in Troeglitz where there's opposition to incoming refugees.\n\nPolitical parties in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom are against the refugees. This opposition has attracted supporters to the political parties.\n\n\"We have a pro-refugee community here,\" Keilholz said. \"But the truth is right now the NPD has more supporters.\"\n\nThe anger comes in spite of the fact that local businesses have been very positive about the benefits of a group of new workers coming to the area. Many young people have left the town for jobs in big cities, so businesses there need new workers. At meetings, a few locals note the risks and costs of the journey to Europe. They say this shows that the refugees are both courageous and come from families that had money, and therefore education.\n\n## Too Many \"Want To Forget\" WWII\n\nLothar Czossek is a local historian. He fears that the burning of the shelter and the threats that frightened the mayor from office show a dangerous problem.\n\n\"Too many Germans are saying enough is enough, and they want to forget our shared history,\" he said. \"The ignorance of this history is alarming\" given that the area had a labor camp where people were killed by Nazis during World War II.'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - Abraham Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address 150 years ago. Back then, a Pennsylvania newspaper printed an article calling the speech \"silly.\"\n\nThis week Harrisburg's Patriot-News retracted the article and apologized. It said the critique of Lincoln's speech was flawed and tainted by excessive pride. Moreover, it lacked the understanding that would come with history.\n\nWith that, the newspaper printed an unusual media apology. The retraction has captured national attention despite its less-than-serious approach.\n\nThe apology said that the people who used to run the newspaper may have been influenced by politics. Or they may have been under the influence of \"strong drink, as was common in the profession at the time.\" The editors back then called President Lincoln's words \"silly remarks\" that deserved to be forgotten. The newspaper said the old editors seemed to believe the speech was \"an indifferent and altogether ordinary message, unremarkable in eloquence and uninspiring\" because it was short.\n\n## Got It \"Jaw-Droppingly Wrong\"\n\n\"Just think: The speech, the exact words of it, are still looked at, thought about and\" taken apart, said Michele Hamill of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. One of five copies of Lincoln's handwritten speech is on display at Cornell in remembrance of its delivery on Nov. 19, 1863.\n\n\"He was a very thoughtful writer, and it shows,\" Hamill said. She was referring both to the penmanship and the substance of the speech. The speech was short - about two minutes - but memorable.\n\nThe current Harrisburg editors ran their editorial Thursday with a column explaining the decision to declare: \"The Patriot-News regrets the error.\"\n\nDonald Gilliland wrote the article that explained the decision. He noted that the dismissive comments about Lincoln's address did not appear until five days after he had delivered it. Days earlier, the paper - then called the Patriot &amp; Union - had devoted a great deal of coverage to the president's visit to the Pennsylvania city. The speech was given at the dedication of a cemetery to Union soldiers killed during the battle there four months earlier.\n\nGilliland wrote that the harsh words that appeared on Nov. 24, 1863, earned the newspaper \"an enduring place in history for having got Lincoln's Gettysburg Address utterly, jaw-droppingly wrong.\"\n\n## Speech Still Resonates\n\nThis isn't the first time a newspaper has apologized many years after the fact. In 2004, the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky apologized for its failures in covering the civil rights movement in the 1960s. The Meridian Star in Mississippi printed an apology timed for President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration. It said that it, and many papers across the South, had failed in their duty to report on important civil rights events.\n\nThe Patriot-News retraction lacks the somber tone of those apologies. But it is no less significant, said Todd Gitlin. He is a professor of journalism at Columbia University.\n\nHe said Lincoln's message - that the nation was in a fight for democracy - is as true today as it was then. He mentioned the current battles over issues such as voter ID laws. Civil rights activists say the laws are designed to limit minority voting.\n\nFive copies of the speech exist: two in the Library of Congress, one in the White House, one at the Illinois State Historical Library and one at Cornell. All are written in Lincoln's neat penmanship, but they contain slight differences.\n\nThe copy at Cornell, for example, reads \"on this continent\" instead of \"upon this continent\" in the famous first line.\n\nThat sets it apart from the two in the Library of Congress. Those were written before Lincoln delivered the address.\n\nLincoln wrote the Cornell copy a few days after the speech. He was asked to by George Bancroft, a historian who wanted to make copies of the document to raise money for wounded soldiers.\n\n## Written In Perfect Penmanship\n\nHamill said Lincoln used high-quality paper and special ink. He sent it to Bancroft, but the effort fell flat. That's because Lincoln had written on both sides of a piece of paper. Technology did not allow the copying of double-sided documents. Bancroft asked for another copy.\n\n\"Imagine, this is a time of war and you're asking Lincoln again to do this thing,\" Hamill said.\n\nThe president sent Bancroft a fresh copy. This time he used two pieces of paper. Bancroft was left with what at the time seemed to be a \"piece of useless paper,\" Hamill said, but he held onto it and willed it to his grandson, a chemistry professor at Cornell.\n\nDuring the Depression, the document was sold to a New York City dealer. But it eventually ended up back in Cornell's hands, where it is guarded by a university police officer while it is on display.\n\nHamill marveled at the idea that a president had taken the time to write out his speech five times while a war was happening. And that he did it in perfect penmanship.\n\nThe Patriot-Union said that with the anniversary of the speech, \"the time was ripe\" to clear the air.\n\n\"Really, this isn't a question of journalism ethics, as would be the case with a serious retraction,\" wrote the paper's deputy opinion editor, Matthew Zencey. \"It was more a way of using the 150th anniversary to say, with a wink, 'Gee, can you believe what rock heads ran this outfit 150 years ago?' \"'"

            "title": "Q&A: Obama again looks at promise to close Guantanamo prison",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - When Barack Obama was running for president, he promised that he would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Easier said than done. As president, he called the prison \"expensive,\" and wasteful and said it helps create more terrorists. Still, he's failed to shut it down. On April 30, Obama promised that he will go back to the Guantanamo problem, which frustrated him during his first term. His promise raises many questions, some easier to answer than others.\n\n## Q: How long has the Guantanamo detention center been around?\n\nA: Then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced on Dec. 27, 2001, that some prisoners captured in Afghanistan would be held at the 45-square-mile U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The first 20 detainees arrived Jan. 11, 2002.\n\n## Q: Why Guantanamo?\n\nA: Pentagon officials considered a variety of Pacific islands and other remote locations for holding men detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Officials eventually turned to Guantanamo, which had been used to house people from Haiti and Cuba who had been picked up on the high seas trying to reach the United States. Officials thought Guantanamo's island location would calm worries about security. Also, since it is part of Cuba, the men held there would not be able to take their case to U.S. courts. However, the Supreme Court later rejected that argument and said they could go to court.\n\n## Q: Who is being held at Guantanamo?\n\nA: Currently, 166 men are detained there, more than half of them from Yemen. Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military court, seven have been charged with crimes - including the five accused of planning in the 9/11 attacks - and 24 may face criminal charges. Another 86 have been cleared for release or transfer to other countries. Also, 46 face no criminal charges but they were found to be too dangerous to release. At its peak, in May 2003, the facility held about 680 men.\n\n## Q: Why are they called detainees rather than prisoners?\n\nA: The Pentagon says it uses the term for most of the men because they have not been convicted of crimes.\n\n## Q: What are the conditions like?\n\nA: When the first detainees arrived, they were housed in wire enclosures that looked like a backyard dog kennel. Now most detainees are in air-conditioned buildings that look like a maximum-security prison in the United States. The buildings are called camps. Until recently, most of the detainees were in Camp 6, where they were allowed to keep their cell doors open and move freely, watch television and eat together. But in April, detainees covered cameras used to monitor them. So guards forced all the prisoners back into their 6.8-foot-by-12-foot cells. The most secret part of Guantanamo, Camp 7, holds about 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks. As of Monday, 100 detainees were refusing food; 23 of those are force-fed twice a day through tubes snaked up their noses and down their throats.\n\n## Q: What rules apply to how they are treated?\n\nA: Detainees are supposed to be treated humanely, based on the Geneva Conventions. This international agreement outlines the humane treatment of prisoners of war. Congress also made a law against \"cruel, inhuman or degrading\" treatment.\n\n## Q: Does the U.S. Constitution apply to detainees at Guantanamo?\n\nA: To a degree. The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 decision that Guantanamo detainees had the same constitutional right to get their day in court as prisoners in the United States. The Supreme Court noted that even though Cuba owns the land, the U.S. has had complete control for more than 100 years. The justices decided that meant it was really part of the United States.\n\n## Q: How much does Guantanamo cost to operate?\n\nA: The White House said it spends about $150 million per year to run Guantanamo. That works out to about $800,00 per prisoner. It costs about $30,000 a year to keep someone at a regular prison in the United States. The U.S. has also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the facility since Bush was in the White House.\n\n## Q: What is stopping Obama from closing it and moving the men to U.S. prisons?\n\nA: Since 2009, Congress has made it difficult for the White House to transfer men out of Guantanamo. One law forbids using money from the military to transfer detainees to the United States. It also forbids sending them to an unstable country where the U.S. might not be able to keep track of them.\n\n## Q: How many released Guantanamo detainees have returned to fighting the United States?\n\nA: People are arguing about that. In January, the top U.S. spy reported on the 603 men who had been sent out of Guantanamo. The report found that 97 went back to fighting U.S. forces. Half of those were dead or back in detention. Another 72 were suspected of fighting against U.S. forces.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The U.S. government could shut down next week if Congress does not pass legislation to keep paying for the government past Monday. Sort of.\n\nIn reality, the government would not actually shut down.\n\nAgents would still patrol the nation's borders. Prisoners would still be held in federal jails. Letter carriers would still deliver the mail. And soldiers would still remain at their posts, though they might not get paid for their service right away.\n\nThe House of Representatives and the Senate must approve a dozen spending bills by Sept. 30 - the last day of the budget year - to keep the government running. The legislation has gotten tied up by Republican efforts to stop money going to the President's new health care plan.\n\n## Government Has Shut Down Before\n\nIt is true that there would be a partial shutdown if Congress does not approve the spending bills on time.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nSocial Security payments and passport and visa applications could be delayed. The National Institutes of Health could stop accepting patients for research. National parks, museums and monuments could close.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of government workers will not be working,\" said Brian Deese of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). \"Even those who are will not be receiving paychecks.\" The OMB manages government agencies and helps the White House with the budget.\n\nThe House is run by Republicans. It passed a proposal last week to keep the government open until mid-December. The catch is the measure also would stop money from going to the federal health care law. Large parts of that law, known by some as Obamacare, are scheduled to start on Tuesday. The Democratic-controlled Senate expects to defeat the House bill, leaving the two sides without a way forward.\n\nCongress has failed to meet the deadline for approving spending bills 17 times since the 1970s. The results were partial shutdowns lasting from one day to three weeks. The last time was for a 21-day stretch in December 1995 and January 1996.\n\n## Agencies Planning For Partial Shutdown\n\nMaya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The group wants lower government debt. She said a shutdown would not have as \"profound or immediate an impact as people think.\" But, she said, \"the fact that this is how we govern is so shameful.\"\n\nThe Obama administration told federal agencies last week to begin planning for a partial shutdown.\n\nManagers have to decide which employees are essential and would be required to come to work. The others would be sent home.\n\nThe president and people he appointed would still report to work. Lawmakers would do the same, but would decide who on their staffs was essential.\n\nThe president has flexibility in deciding what is essential, Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told reporters. \"So how much of the government stops working and how much keeps working is not something we have a good basis for predicting.\"\n\nThe administration would rely on a variety of documents. It would get Department of Justice legal opinions and OMB planning memos. History would also play a part.\n\nIn 2011, during a similar shutdown threat, the government estimated that about all but 800,000 of the more than 2 million federal employees would go to work. This year's estimates are similar.\n\n## Research Programs Would Be Halted\n\nThe law requires agencies to be staffed with unsalaried employees if they deal with national security, process benefit payments or protect life and property, according to the OMB. Government operations not directly paid for by the Treasury would also continue.\n\nThat means disaster aid to the Colorado flood victims would proceed but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would stop monitoring diseases. Mail delivery would continue but loan programs to small businesses, farmers and homeowners would cease. Inspectors would still regulate food and drugs but research programs would be halted. Taxes would be collected but judges would have to go home when the courts run out of funds.\n\nEven the health care law that is the focus of the dispute between Republicans and Democrats would continue to be implemented. Much of its funding comes from other sources, including new taxes and fees and cuts to other programs.\n\nBarry Anderson worked for the White House budget office during the 1995-96 shutdown. He said the task of determining which employees are essential is difficult and keeps changing.\n\nFor example, Anderson said, the OMB could determine that while the National Zoo must close, the workers who feed the animals must work. Later, as a shutdown goes on, employees in charge of buying food for the animals may have to come in.\n\n## Will Workers Get Paid Afterward?\n\nAfter the government reopens, lawmakers must decide whether employees - both those who worked and those who didn't - should get paid. In the 1990s shutdowns the workers were paid, but it was not guaranteed.\n\nChris Edwards is a budget expert at the Cato Institute, which favors limited government. He said that if there is a positive outcome of a shutdown it could be that people may start thinking about which services the government provides are necessary and which should be permanently dropped.\n\n\"You can ask why do we do certain things in the first place,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tMotorcycle thefts are falling nationwide, but one make is still the target of thieves. Of five major brands, Harley-Davidson was the only one that had a jump in the number of bikes stolen in 2013.\n\nIt's hard to say why more Harleys continue to be stolen. One theory is that Harley riders are too trusting. Many leave their bikes unlocked and unattended because most fellow riders won't mess with them.\n\nThere were 3,907 Harley-Davidsons stolen in the United States last year, up 4 percent from 2012. On the other hand, fewer Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki motorcycles were stolen. The drop in thefts of those bikes ranged from 2.1 percent for Kawasaki, to 9.1 percent for Suzuki. The theft numbers came from the National Insurance Crime Bureau.\n\nOverall, thefts have fallen even as the number of bikes sold increased. There were 45,367 motorcycle thefts reported in the United States in 2013, down 1.5 percent compared with the previous year.\n\n## Keep One Eye On Your Bike\n\nThe thefts were highest in California, followed by Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Indiana.\n\nAt least one motorcycle theft ring targets motels along the routes of rallies, where bikers gather to show off their bikes to one another. The ring steals the motorcycles straight out of motel parking lots.\n\nHarley rider Jim Bidwell had a 2007 Ultra Glide, which he customized with special parts to his own liking. The bike was stolen this spring. It was taken from the parking lot of a bar in Wisconsin.\n\nThe bike, which Bidwell valued at $45,000, was stolen on a Sunday afternoon in May.\n\nThe bar was packed with people, Bidwell said, and he had just shown the bike to some of them three minutes earlier.\n\n\"We parked right in front of the bar - I was 15 feet\" away from the bike, he said.\n\nNo one reported seeing the theft take place, Bidwell said. The bike was unlocked and could be started without a key.\n\n## The Thieves Are Fast And Bold\n\nBidwell has since published a plea on Facebook seeking information about the theft.\n\n\"We are not going to give up until she is home,\" the plea says.\n\nThousands of people have viewed the posting, and some swore they saw the bike in various places.\n\n\"Someone said they thought they saw it near Nashville (Tennessee),\" Bidwell said. The bike had $29,340 in add-ons and had won nine custom motorcycle contests.\n\n\"My word to everybody is 'lock up your bike,' I cannot repeat that enough,\" he said.\n\nThere have been similar bold thefts of motorcycles in Wisconsin's Fox Valley this spring. In one case, a bike was stolen from the parking lot of a movie theater.\n\nGenerally, there aren't many motorcycle thefts at biker rallies.\n\n\"People are very trusting. It's a Harley brotherhood,\" Bidwell said. Riders never \"touch somebody else's bike without their permission.\"\n\nThere's an unwritten honor code among riders, but unfortunately it's not enough to stop thieves, said police officer Aaron Zemlock.\n\nZemlock recently investigated the theft of a Harley-Davidson from a parking lot in the middle of the day.\n\nThe bike was parked in plain view. The thief, still not caught, can be seen on video driving away and nearly causing an accident.\n\n\"It looked like he was dropped off by another vehicle,\" Zemlock said. The thief \"walked up to the bike, and was there for less than two minutes.\"\n\nHe added, \"It was bold, absolutely.\"\n\n## Most Stolen Bikes Are Never Found\n\nThirty-seven percent of the motorcycles reported stolen in the United States in 2013 were recovered.\n\n\"In some cases, fairly rare bikes have been recovered, including a 1953 Triumph,\" said insurer Roger Morris. That bike was \"returned to its rightful owner 53 years later. He is 73 years old now.\"\n\nOften, bikes are cut up and sold for parts. The parts, or whole motorcycles, are sometimes shipped overseas where they are worth much more and can't easily be traced.\n\n\"We have found barrels of motorcycle parts being shipped out of the country,\" Morris said.\n\nLocks, alarms and parking your motorcycle in a secure location are still the best ways to prevent theft. A bike can be stolen in seconds.\n\nTo protect against it, Morris recommends buying insurance coverage. Insurance costs a fraction of an item's value. If the item is stolen or destroyed, the insurance company pays to replace the item.\n\n\"You would be surprised at how many people don't have theft coverage,\" Morris said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - It's 10 a.m. Monday and the call center of Connecticut's new health insurance exchange is bustling with questions. An elderly man calls to ask if the land he owns will count as income. A legal immigrant asks if she can sign up for a health plan through the state's online insurance marketplace. A broker wants help to become certified to start selling coverage.\n\nThe exchange was set up under the Affordable Care Act, the federal health law. About 25 operators in blue shaded cubicles are talking on telephone headsets. A dozen more callers wait on hold.\n\n\"It's controlled chaos,\" said David Lynch, the call center manager.\n\n## Call Centers Get A Presidential Shout-Out\n\nPeople were supposed to shop for and enroll in healthcare plans through healthcare.gov, a website run by the federal government for residents of 36 states. But the site has been working poorly. President Barack Obama mentioned the call centers last week. He said they were one of several alternatives for people having trouble using the website.\n\n\"The call centers are available,\" he said, giving the telephone number. \"You can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process. Once you get on the phone with a trained representative, it usually takes about 25 minutes for an individual to apply for coverage, about 45 minutes for a family.\"\n\nBut consumer advocates say the centers were never meant to be an alternative to the insurance exchange website. They were only supposed to be a way to offer some consumers more help to understand their options.\n\n\"The telephone call center is not a realistic alternative to the website,\" said Adam Linker. He works on health care issues for the North Carolina Justice Center, a group that represents consumers. \"The marketplace was billed as a place to easily shop and compare plans.\" There is no way to do that on the phone, he said.\n\nOthers agree that the call centers' representatives can provide only limited help to those who want to shop for insurance. That's because some states have dozens of plans to choose from. The process could take hours to sort through on the telephone. In addition, the representatives are also having trouble getting information from healthcare.gov. So it is difficult for them to check people's identities and income.\n\nOne healthcare.gov operator said she cannot provide exact prices and benefits before a caller answers a series of questions. The answers are needed to set up an account. She can only offer average premiums in a particular area without going through that process.\n\n## Operators Stumped By Delays\n\nCall center operators face many of the same delays as consumers because of the broken federal website, said John Foley. He is a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County in Florida. The group received money from the federal government to help people figure out the sign-up process.\n\n\"We are facing the same glitches on the telephone,\" he said. He tells people to wait until the website becomes easier to use.\n\nThere are 17 call centers with more than 10,000 trained representatives to assist consumers. States such as Connecticut that have set up their own state marketplace also have their own call centers.\n\nTimothy Jost is a consumer advocate and law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. He said that young and healthy people, who may be less motivated to sign up, probably won't wait through hours-long phone calls.\n\nThe situation is easier in the Hartford call center. Connecticut has set up its own exchange. Its website is also functioning. Since Access Health CT opened on Oct. 1, an average of 1,300 people a day have called or asked for assistance to help fill out applications. Over 10,000 residents have started applications. More than 4,200 have enrolled in plans.\n\n## Buying Insurance Is Not Easy\n\n\"Telephone assistance is something that people really want,\" said Lynn Quincy with Consumers Union. \"Many people are intimidated by the task of buying insurance on their own.\"\n\nBenjamin Hunnicutt, who manages the Hartford call center, said most callers are older or poorer than people using the website. The top questions are about how much will the regular payments cost and how to estimate how much of a discount they are eligible to receive. The operators also have information about which doctors and hospitals that are available in different plans.\n\nSome do enroll over the phone, which can take about 50 minutes. The exchange did not know how many had completed enrollment online.\n\nTelephone enrollment is easy in Connecticut because just three companies are selling plans. In states such as California and Florida where more than a dozen companies are selling plans, that could take much longer, Hunnicutt said.'"

            "text": "b\"_Eric H. Holder is attorney general of the United States. President Barack Obama named him to run the U.S. Department of Justice. He also serves in the president's cabinet. One of the Department of Justice's duties is to make sure that all people are treated fairly under the law. The following is a letter written by Holder for the St. Louis Post Dispatch, adapted by Newsela. _\n\nSince the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown by a police officer, the nation and the world have watched the angry protests gripping Ferguson, Missouri. Demonstrators are demanding answers about how this young man died. Many question the fairness of our criminal justice system.\n\nI run the Justice Department, making me the top law enforcement officer and lawyer for the government. My department intends to learn exactly what happened. The people of Ferguson can have confidence that we will do a fair and thorough investigation to find out what happened.\n\nOn Wednesday, I was in Ferguson to be filled in on the civil rights investigation that I ordered over a week ago. I met with community leaders, the FBI and government lawyers to get more details of the case.\n\n## Help Calm The Anger\n\nThis investigation will take time to complete, but we have already taken important steps. About 40 FBI agents and some of the government's most experienced lawyers are leading this process. Hundreds of people have already been questioned to share what they know about the death of Michael Brown. On Monday, I sent a team of doctors to do a careful examination of Brown's body.\n\nFerguson police have done an investigation. But we understand the need for another investigation, not involving the police. We hope that we can help calm the anger in Ferguson by finding out the truth of what really happened. In order to begin the healing process, however, we must first see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson. These acts have been caused by just a few of the protesters, many who come from outside Ferguson. They are not helping. In fact, they seriously hurt the efforts to see justice done in Ferguson. And they prevent us from talking about the issues of discrimination that the protesters are talking about.\n\nThe Justice Department will defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate. But violence and theft cannot be allowed. I urge the citizens of Ferguson to speak out against the actions of people who create conflict and make the situation worse.\n\nLaw enforcement has a job to do in calming people's anger, as well. As the brother of a retired police officer, I know what our police go through to do their jobs. Every day they put their lives on the line and often have to make split-second decisions.\n\n## Creating Trust\n\nAt the same time, good law enforcement requires creating trust between the police and the public. This trust is all-important, but it is also easily broken. It requires that force be used in appropriate ways. How we enforce the law and arrest people must not lead to treating people differently just because of their color. And police forces should include men and women from different groups and races. They should look like the communities they serve.\n\nOver the years, we have made major progress on these issues. But we still have much to do. We should continue to discuss our problems, and we must also act. It is painfully clear, across our great nation, that more progress, more talk, and more action are needed.\n\nI pledge to the people of Ferguson that our investigation will be full and fair. We will not let anyone influence us one way or another. And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public. Our goal is to bring the police closer to the communities they serve. Long after the events of Aug. 9, the Justice Department will continue to stand with this community.\n\nAs we move forward, I ask for the public's help and patience. And I urge anyone with information about the shooting to call the FBI by dialing 800-CALL-FBI, option 4.\""

            "title": "Huckabee was Arkansas governor, now he wants to be president",
            "text": "\tFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee announced plans to run for president on Tuesday.\n\nHuckabee made his announcement at his boyhood home in Hope, Arkansas. He is the sixth Republican candidate to officially enter the race. On Monday, Dr. Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina announced plans to seek the White House. They joined three Republican senators who already joined in the race. These are Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nHuckabee faces several problems. His main problem is rivals who appeal to the same voters as Huckabee.\n\n## Now People Know Him\n\nHuckabee, 59, is a favorite of traditional and evangelical Christian voters. In 2008, he had many loyal supporters for president. But this time, he may be competing against more rivals who are also stronger candidates. Huckabee, a preacher, has remained in the public eye and in voters' living rooms through hosting a Fox News show. However, he has been out of elected office for more than eight years.\n\nHis rivals also can raise a lot of money, which is necessary to pay for campaign ads. Fundraising is a skill Huckabee lacked in the 2008 campaign, when he raised just $16 million. In contrast, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had more than $100 million to spend in the early voting.\n\nIn 2008, Huckabee was not able to raise much money and people thought it was OK because many people did not know who he was, said Bob Vander Plaats. In 2008, Vander Plaats helped run Huckabee's campaign in Iowa. \"Now everyone knows who (Huckabee) is.\"\n\n## Looking For Voter Support\n\nIn 2008, Huckabee was not regarded as a serious White House candidate. Then he did better than experts thought. His success was partly due to the lack of serious competition.\n\nHowever, now there many more Republican candidates. The competition is also stronger. Several of them, such as Cruz and Governor Scott Walker, are also popular with religious conservatives and people who hold traditional values.\n\nSeveral other possible candidates appeal to religious conservative voters. They include former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Paul is also trying to get the support of religious voters.\n\nVander Plaats said that choosing a candidate is like shopping for a new car. He is the president of Family Leader, an Iowa-based Christian conservative group. \"So people are going to want to take a test drive, kick the tires, and sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates and see if that's the direction they want to go,\" he said.\n\n## \"They Held Out Hope\"\n\nVander Plaats said that Huckabee hopes that his supporters will take a look at other candidates. Then, they will come back and vote for him.\n\nA poll released Monday, however, was not so certain. It showed that just over half of Republican voters said they could see themselves voting for Huckabee. Rubio, Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush all received much more support.\n\nHuckabee's core supporters remain devoted to him.\n\n\"It's kind of like first love,\" said Craig Robinson. He created the Iowa Republican website. Robinson said that Huckabee's supporters are not the type to be interested in another candidate. \"They held out hope he would run in 2012,\" he said. \"They're the kind of people who never even shopped the field because Mike Huckabee is their guy.\"\n\n## He Has Been Criticized\n\nHuckabee connected with working-class voters by pointing to his poor upbringing. He was the first male in his father's family to graduate from high school. He was also one generation removed on his mother's side from dirt floors and outdoor toilets.\n\nSome people complained that Huckabee does not always follow the Republican Party's position. He was criticized for supporting some tax increases when he was governor. He supported the closure of the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which holds people suspected of making war on the United States. He also changed his mind on supporting immigration and the ban against trading with Cuba.\n\nHis rivals are likely to bring up all of these issues.\n\n\"The field is so strong this time, it's going to be extremely difficult for Huckabee,\" said Sam Clovis. He a professor at Morningside College in Iowa and an influential former radio host.'"

            "title": "Recording music as data, not sound",
            "text": "\tThe Disklavier looks like just a normal piano. What makes it special is the way it records the music pianists make. It doesn't record music as sound. Instead, it uses sensors to record a piano player's hand and foot movements as tiny bits of information.\n\nThose digital bits of information are called data. Once they're recorded, they can be sent over the Internet. Then, Disklavier pianos thousands of miles can play back the music just as the pianist originally played it.\n\nIt could change how we experience music. Russian pianist Osip Nikiforov, 19, is recording a classical song on the Disklavier. He's doing it without capturing any of its sound, but all its digital information.\n\n\"These pianos are fantastic teaching tools,\" said Nikiforov. \"You can correct things based on just listening to yourself. While you could do that with any recording, this one is even closer.\" And it's more accurate, he says.\n\n## Tryouts And Teaching\n\nNikiforov plays a Disklavier owned by Stella Sick. She's a music professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn.\n\nSick says Nikiforov could use the piano to try out for another music school, saving travel and other costs. But Disklaviers themselves aren't cheap. They cost $40,000 to $240,000 and are made by the Yamaha company. To promote the pianos, Yamaha has simplified how recorded tryouts can be sent over the Internet.\n\nLast year, the company created a website to store the tryouts. The site allows Disklavier performances to be shared among 18 U.S. universities and 28 places where students can go to try out. The number is expected to grow this year to 50 universities and 40 to 50 places to try out.\n\nNikiforov has already benefited from Internet tryout. At age 13, he sent a recording from an older Disklavier in Russia to try out for an international music contest based in Minnesota. He won third place, and the experience brought him there to study.\n\nSick, also born in Russia, is teaching differently now because of the Disklavier. She listens to the Disklavier's playback. At the same time, she watches a video of the player's movements. By doing so, she can help students correct their mistakes.\n\n## Piano's Hammer Speed\n\nSick does some work for Yamaha. She recently helped demonstrate the Disklavier for the music department staff at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. The school is wrestling with a decision on whether to use it as a way for potential music students to try out.\n\nDisklaviers first became available in the U.S. in 1987. In those days, they recorded piano data on disks - like CDs. Now that they can share music over the Internet, university music teachers are taking another look at them. Disklaviers are also attractive because they don't need fast Internet speeds for uploads and downloads.\n\nDisklaviers are wired with extremely accurate sensors to measure the movement of its parts. For example, when a piano key is struck, it causes a hammer to strike a piano string. A sensor measures and records the speed of that hammer at 1,023 different levels. It stores the result as data. That data can be used to copy that hammer speed on another Disklavier. The sound produced is practically the same to that of the original piano.\n\nUniversities are interested in how the Disklaviers can help in classroom teaching. Aside from that, universities are also looking at using them to allow students to try out without having to leave their hometowns. They wonder whether having them try out using the Disklavier will help them get students from all over the world.\n\n\"The more competitive schools want students auditioning from Asia and Europe,\" says George Litterst. He's a Massachusetts pianist who also works for Yamaha. \"Wayne State College in Nebraska recently listened to a remote tryout from a high school junior who lives in the Aleutian Islands (in Alaska).\"\n\n## A Disklavier's Playback\n\nThe University of Minnesota just purchased its first Disklavier. Alexander Braginsky, a professor of piano at the school, sees it as a valuable teaching tool.\n\nInitially, it will be used to receive tryout recordings for the 2015 International e-Piano Junior Competition to be held at the university. The university will also use it for teaching.\n\n\"When I play back a Disklavier recording, I can slow it down 50 percent or speed it up 25 percent without changing the key it's being played in,\" Braginsky said. When you slow down songs on most devices, it sounds lower than when it's played at normal speed. \"That helps piano students hear what I hear. The playback usually brings a whole lot of surprises.\"\n\nBut that's just the beginning, he said. He has used one of the Disklaviers to do piano lessons when he is in Minneapolis and the person he's teaching is in New York. Someone in New York can teach piano to someone in Tokyo, he added. \"I think the uses for music education are yet to be fully explored.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Every year, thousands of people are injured as they walk in the city. Many of these pedestrian injuries are caused by people who are distracted by their cellphones, studies show.\n\nWalkers using their cellphones stroll into traffic. They crash into trees. They fall off bridges and curbs. They even walk into wet cement.\n\nMany cities want to make their neighborhoods more walkable. Neighborhoods good for walking can attract young people who may not have a car. At the same time, cities are trying to make the streets safer for pedestrians. They are giving tickets to distracted walkers and are making cars slow down.\n\n## More People Are Hurt Every Year\n\nThe number of pedestrian injuries caused by cellphone use is rising. It is up 35 percent since 2010, according to information from hospital emergency rooms.\n\nCities and states share the same goal of reducing injuries and deaths for walkers. Yet they have very different plans to fix the problem.\n\nIn Utah and New Jersey, people can get tickets for texting while walking. New York City now has lower speed limits, partly to make traffic less dangerous for distracted walkers.\n\n\"We have to design streets for the way people actually behave, and behavior is changing,\" said Noah Budnick of Transportation Alternatives. \"If you're looking at a phone when you're walking around, that shouldn't mean death. So we have to design forgiving streets.\"\n\nIn New York City, the new speed limits are 20 miles per hour (mph) in Central Park and 25 mph in the rest of the city unless it says otherwise. The city has also blocked off more streets for pedestrian plazas, where cars are not allowed.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx has given $1.6 million to Louisville, Kentucky; New York City and Philadelphia for walker-safety programs.\n\n\"We've got to encourage people to have an awareness that this problem is a real problem,\" Foxx said last year.\n\n## Special Sidewalk Lanes\n\nIn 2012, 78,000 pedestrians were injured, the highest number since 2001. Walking deaths have been rising since 2009. In 2012, 4,700 walkers were killed.\n\nSome states are focusing on stopping distracted walkers. Walkers who text in Utah can face a $50 fine. Police in New Jersey gave tickets to people using phones while walking into traffic.\n\nPhiladelphia had a different plan. They made a joke of it. On April Fools' Day in 2012, the city painted \"e-lanes\" on sidewalks. These lanes were reserved for people staring at their phones.\n\nSome people interviewed by the city thought the lanes were serious, and a good idea.\n\n\"It'll keep most of those bozos out of my way,\" one cellphone user said.\n\nSan Francisco has promised to spend $50 million for its Walk First program. The city will examine \"high injury\" areas to determine why they are so dangerous for walkers.\n\n## The Dangers Of Texting While Walking\n\nDrivers using cellphones also add to the danger, researchers say. A distracted driver and a distracted walker can be a dangerous combination. In a survey, half of walkers admitted to talking on the phone while crossing the street. One out of 4 said they text or email while crossing the street, even though they know it is dangerous.\n\nDr. Dietrich Jehle of the University of Buffalo started studying walking injuries while he was an emergency room doctor. He estimates that 1 in 10 pedestrian injuries is now related to distracted walking. Jehle has also found that distracted walking causes more injuries than distracted driving.\n\nTexting is the most dangerous thing for a walker to do, Jehle found. Texting is more dangerous than listening to music or talking on the phone, he says.\n\n\"While talking on the phone is a distraction, texting is much more dangerous because you can't see the path in front of you,\" Jehle said.'"

            "text": "\tMILWAUKEE, Wis. - With a drone, Zach Fiene can receive detailed pictures of a corn field.\n\nHe can see exactly what parts of the field are struggling with plant disease, insects or a lack of water. In minutes, he can gather as much information as someone walking for several hours.\n\n\"You can basically point the camera to where you want it to go,\" said Fiene, co-owner of DMZ Aerial.\n\nA drone is like a remote-controlled airplane equipped with a camera. It flies overhead and can take pictures or video. Drones are also called unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs. They are piloted by onboard computers or remotely by a person on the ground.\n\n## A Farmer's Extra Pair Of \"Eyes\"\n\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International is an organization for drone manufacturers and users. It says that as the technology improves and farmers accept it, 80 percent of all business drones may be used for agriculture.\n\nSmall and cheap aerial drones can help farmers put weed killers and plant fertilizers precisely where the chemicals are needed. They can identify especially dry areas of a field, directing irrigation systems to those spots without wasting water elsewhere. The aerial robots also can spot predators in livestock herds, and direct farmers to those locations.\n\nDrone technology is getting better. Things like 3-D images and temperature readings from drones could be combined with other information. Farmers would get even more information about growing conditions. It would help farmers to save money.\n\nOn foot, it can take hours to walk through a field. Even then, farmers can still miss something, according to Fiene, who is a trained crop scout.\n\n\"You might walk past a problem area, not see it. And three weeks later the corn is dead because disease has spread,\" he said.\n\n## \"We Can't See Them\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is writing new drone rules. These would let drones be used regularly for business. This year, it approved dozens of permits for agricultural drone businesses.\n\nSome aviation professionals worry about the risk of midair collisions.\n\n\"We can't see them,\" Andrew Moore said about small drones. He is with the National Agricultural Aviation Association.\n\nMoore's group wants lights and tracking systems on drones.\n\n\"Every time there's a report of a drone almost hitting a plane, that's not good for us,\" Fiene said.\n\nThere are privacy issues, too, because drones can take pictures of people without them knowing. It also raises questions about who owns the information from a drone flying over someone's property.\n\n\"Nothing is really private anymore, from the air. I have told farmers to look up their address on Google Earth, and they would be amazed at the pictures out there,\" said Casey Langan. He with the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation.\n\n## Seeking A Better Way\n\nDMZ Aerial was started three years ago by Zach Fiene and his cousin, Mitch Fiene. Now they have drones in 15 states, including California and Texas.\n\nBefore they started the business, the two covered fields on foot or in vehicles.\n\n\"We always thought there has to be a more efficient way of doing this,\" Zach Fiene said.\n\nAt first, the Fienes strapped cameras on radio-controlled airplanes, which was one of their hobbies. Some of their first drones were limited to about seven minutes of flight time, before the batteries had to be recharged. They could not fly more than 300 feet away.\n\nNow they have drones that fly 50 miles per hour and can be controlled remotely from more than a mile away. Drones have to remain in sight of the person at the controls.\n\nThe drones return if batteries run low or they have lost contact with the operator. Some drones can be flown by people with little experience or training.\n\n## Fieldwork Gets Done Faster\n\nLandmark Cooperative Services is an agricultural business in Wisconsin. It uses aerial drones in addition to people walking through the fields. When a problem is spotted from the air, the crop scout can go to take a closer look.\n\n\"What normally would take a couple of hours, in scouting time, can be done in minutes,\" said Chase Sellnow, who is with Landmark.\n\nDrones also break up the boredom of field work.\n\n\"It's a blast. I think everybody wants to fly,\" Sellnow said.'"

            "text": "\tFilm directors, sports teams, farmers, oil companies and many other businesses are hoping the government will allow them to use a high-flying technology: drones.\n\nDrones are small airplanes or helicopters that are flown by remote control, without a pilot. They are often used in situations that would be too dangerous for a plane with a pilot.\n\nThe U.S. military has been using drones for years to drop bombs on targets overseas. Now, many different kinds of companies hope to experiment with drones.\n\nDrones could be used for almost anything in the future, said drone expert Rachel Stohl.\n\n## Show Me A License\n\nToday, almost no companies are using drones. The U.S. government hasn't allowed them to. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the government group that controls flying in the U.S., including airplanes, helicopters and airports.\n\nSo far, the FAA has mainly allowed police and research groups to use drones. It hasn't given out many permits to businesses that want to use the unmanned aircraft.\n\nThe FAA is working on a plan to deal with drones. Right now, drones are not allowed in U.S. airspace. Because of this rule, drones cannot fly too high or go into certain areas. The FAA's plan is supposed to be finished by 2015, but it may take longer, a government official said.\n\nDrones are a challenge for the FAA. Traditional aircraft - airplanes and helicopters - come in standard shapes and sizes. They are used for common jobs. Drones can come in any shape and size. They can also be used for almost anything.\n\n\"[The FAA] is having a really hard time understanding the technology,\" said Mary Louise Cummings, who teaches at Duke University.\n\n## Smaller And Cheaper\n\nDrones can solve problems for many different types of companies. Drones are often smaller and cheaper than traditional aircraft. They can go into areas that are too dangerous for people.\n\nDifficult terrain, such as mountains or desert, are a good place to use drones, Stohl said. They are also useful when conditions on the ground are dangerous, such as during a riot or a volcano   eruption. Drones could also be used to rescue people or fight fires, Cummings said.\n\nMany industries need high-quality photos taken from the air, Cummings said. Some of the industries include farming, entertainment, mapmaking, mining and wildlife conservation. Drones could fly above bridges and into tunnels to check on safety issues.\n\n\"Anywhere where you think you need to see something from high up, it's going to be not only cheaper but safer,\" Cummings said.\n\n## Send In The Drones!\n\nSome businesses have begun using drones and many more are considering it.\n\nInsurance companies in particular have a need for drones. When disasters hit like earthquakes or floods, people can lose their homes or cars.\n\nIn order to begin rebuilding, people need payments from insurance companies. These companies help people recover from disasters. To get the payments, insurance workers must look at the damage. Sometimes, after an earthquake or flood, the area can be too dangerous for the workers.\n\nDrones would allow the insurance workers to get information without putting themselves in danger.\n\nInsurance is not the only type of business that wants drones. Movie companies want to use the remotely operated planes to film scenes from the sky. Large oil companies want to use drones to search for oil off the coast of Alaska. Golfers want to use drones to film golf events. The Washington Nationals baseball team used a small helicopter-like drone to take pictures of the team.\n\nEven college football players have been using drones in practice. Clemson University uses one to film football practices, which can help the players improve.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - If you can't smoke a cigarette where you're standing, you can't smoke an e-cigarette either. On Tuesday, Los Angeles joined a growing list of cities to treat e-cigarettes the same as regular cigarettes. It will ban their use in parks, restaurants and most workplaces.\n\nE-cigarettes have been called a safer alternative to cancer-causing tobacco products. The companies that make them claim they can help get heavy smokers off their habit.\n\nThe decision came after a passionate and personal debate at the City Council. Just as the popularity of smokeless cigarettes has grown, so has their number of critics.\n\nE-cigarettes make a vapor that contains nicotine. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes it so addictive. E-cigarette users breathe it in, just like they were smoking a real cigarette. But critics warn that they could pave the way for today's young adults to pick up a tobacco habit.\n\n## Secondhand Vapor\n\nDr. Jonathan Fielding runs the Los Angeles Department of Public of Health. He said the growing comfort with e-cigarettes is a threat. It could undo years of public education efforts about the dangers of smoking.\n\n\"We have a right to ... choose to breathe clean air,\" Councilwoman Nury Martinez told the council. If e-cigarettes turn out to be safe, then the ban can always be undone. \"But if this device proves not to be safe, we cannot undo the harm this will create on the public health.\"\n\nFive states and the District of Columbia have already included e-cigarettes in anti-smoking bans. Last year, New York City passed a rule applying traditional anti-smoking rules to e-cigarettes. Chicago recently moved to prohibit vaping in bars, restaurants and most indoor public places. \"Vaping\" is how e-cigarette use is known.\n\nThe e-cigarette crackdown has come \"much faster than what happened with smoke-free\" laws, said Tim McAfee. He runs the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's Office on Smoking and Health. It has not yet released any numbers about the possible harm of secondhand vapor.\n\nLos Angeles' decision means that within weeks, e-cigarette users will have to hang out with smokers. The devices will be permitted in vaping lounges. There, customers can sample flavored e-cigarette liquids. But they will be outlawed in outdoor dining areas of restaurants and at city-sponsored farmers markets.\n\nCities are acting fast. But at the national level, e-cigarettes are still treated differently than tobacco products. Americans haven't seen a cigarette ad on TV for years. But e-cigarette manufacturer NJOY ran spots during the Super Bowl.\n\n## An Emotional Debate\n\nTuesday's City Hall debate quickly turned personal. Councilman Mitch O'Farrell, who pushed for the new restrictions, recalled his days breathing secondhand smoke as a waiter in a downtown restaurant. Martinez, who sided with O'Farrell, described her husband's unsuccessful battle to quit smoking.\n\nCouncilman Joe Buscaino led an unsuccessful attempt to let bars and nightclubs still allow e-cigarettes. He too mentioned a family member while making his arguments.\n\nE-cigarettes \"are not tobacco,\" he said. \"I don't think they should be regulated exactly the same way. And I've heard from so many people, including my cousin Anthony, that they've stopped smoking from the help of e-cigarettes.\"\n\nBut Council President Herb Wesson didn't like Buscaino's idea to allow vaping in bars. He told lawmakers that he has been hooked on cigarettes for nearly 40 years - and will probably die because of them.\n\nCalling himself \"the council's No. 1 smoker,\" Wesson said he took up the habit as a 20-year-old factory worker because he wanted to be \"cool.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, the high percentage of kids that smoke, smoke because it's cool. And when you're 15 you want to be cool,\" he said. \"I will not support anything - anything - that might attract one new smoker.\"\n\nManuel Suarez Jr., owner of Golden State Vape Shop, said fear about the devices is based on misunderstanding.\n\nWe're here for \"people who've been smoking for over 20 years,\" he said. \"We're here to help them quit.\"'"

They are watching activity in games such as \"World of Warcraft,\" news organizations reported.\n\nThe New York Times, the Guardian and ProPublica all reported on the spying on Monday. They said U.S. and U.K. spies have spent years looking in online games for terrorists or people who give them information.\n\nThe stories were based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who used to do work for the National Security Agency (NSA). The leaked information shows just how far America's spying campaign has gone. Even fantasy worlds aren't beyond the attention of the NSA and the British spy agency GCHQ.\n\n## Millions Of Gamers Watched\n\nVirtual universes like \"World of Warcraft\"  draw in millions of players. Those players spend months' worth of real-world time competing with other players for online glory, virtual treasure and magical loot. At its height, \"World of Warcraft\" had 12 million paying subscribers. That is more than the population of Greece.\n\nMillions more people are in other online worlds. These include Linden Labs' \"Second Life\" while the various games on Microsoft's Xbox host millions more. Xbox is home to \"Halo,\" the popular science fiction-themed shoot-em-up.\n\nSpy agencies have long worried that such games serve as a good cover for enemies. Those people could use in-game messaging systems to swap information. In one of the documents mentioned Monday, the NSA warned that the games could give terrorists a place to \"hide in plain sight.\"\n\nLinden Labs and Microsoft Inc. did not immediately return messages seeking comment. In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said that it did not know of any spying taking place. \"If it was, it would have been done without our knowledge or permission,\" the company said.\n\nMicrosoft issued a similar statement. It said it did not know about any monitoring. \"If it has occurred as reported, it certainly wasn't done with our consent,\" Microsoft said.\n\n## Profiling The Players?\n\nThe 82-page-document was published on The New York Times website. It noted that opponents could use video games to recruit other users. They could also hold weapons training, the document said. The Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers had used flight simulation software to hone their skills, the document said.\n\nImportant details were not clear, the Times and ProPublica said. How did the agencies get access to gamers' information? How many players were watched? Were Americans swept up in the spying? Still, the reports point to a determined effort to get inside a world many people associate with adolescents and shut-ins.\n\nAt the request of GCHQ, the NSA began pulling \"World of Warcraft\" information from its global spying operation. It tried to tie specific accounts and characters to Islamic extremism and weapons trading, the Guardian reported.\n\nIntelligence on the fantasy world could eventually translate to real-world success, one of the documents suggested. \"World of Warcraft\" players included \"telecom engineers, embassy drivers, scientists, the military and other intelligence agencies,\" it said.\n\n\"World of Warcraft\" wasn't the only target. Another memo noted that GCHQ had \"successfully been able to get the discussions between different game players on Xbox Live.\" Meanwhile, so many U.S. spies were roaming around \"Second Life\" that a special unit was set up to prevent them from stepping on each other's toes.'"

Blood stops flowing to the brain and other organs. The victim is unconscious. If not treated within minutes, it usually results in death.\n\nSudden cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack. In a heart attack, the blood flow is blocked, but the heart usually doesn't stop beating and the person remains conscious.\n\nPulsePoint has helped save lives in cities such as Cleveland, Ohio. In the last year, about 4,000 people there have downloaded the app. Thirty-six citizens there have responded to almost three dozen calls.\n\nSome of the emergency apps that have been developed in recent years help people alert authorities if they're having a health crisis. Others make important information about a patient available to emergency responders. This information includes the name of the patient's doctor, emergency contacts, allergies, medications and medical condition.\n\nA free app called 911HelpSMS informs a user of where he is located before he calls 911 in a medical emergency. It also instantly texts family members and gives them the person's GPS location.\n\n## Alerting A Lot Of People\n\nAnother free app called EMNet finderER was developed for Massachusetts General Hospital. It allows people to quickly locate the nearest hospital in an emergency.\n\nThe PulsePoint app works through crowdsourcing. This means it reaches out to a large number of people in order to find someone nearby to help a patient who has suffered cardiac arrest.\n\nEvery year, more than 326,000 people who were not in a hospital experience cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association. Ninety percent of them die. But if correct CPR is given within three to five minutes, it can double or triple a victim's chance of surviving.\n\nCPR involves pushing down on the chest of the victim to help their heart start beating again.\n\nHere's how PulsePoint works. When a 911 call about a cardiac arrest in a public place comes in, PulsePoint app users are notified at the same time as first responders, like police, firefighters or paramedics. The users who are closest in distance are the ones who get the alert.\n\n## A Free App\n\nThe PulsePoint app also directs citizen responders to the place where they can find the nearest defibrillator. A defibrillator is a device that sends an electric shock to the heart to try to restore its normal rhythm.\n\nThe app is free for users. Cities pay to use the app based on the size of their populations. So far, PulsePoint has been activated more than 4,000 times and more than 10,000 citizens have responded.\n\nThere are success stories of how PulsePoint has helped save lives.\n\nOne of these lives was a 56-year-old man from Oregon. He was in his car outside his gym when he experienced cardiac arrest.\n\nAnother was a 5-week-old baby with an enlarged kidney in Washington state. The baby went into cardiac arrest at a ballet shop where his sister was getting a tutu.\n\nShannon Smith works for PulsePoint. She said that the app gives people who have been trained in CPR the ability to find someone who is in distress and to know where to find a defibrillator. This helps increase the chances of the patient surviving.\n\n## A Big Help\n\nJeff Helm runs emergency response for Sioux Falls, South Dakota. His department launched PulsePoint more than two years ago. When the program started, some people raised questions about keeping people's health information safe. They also wanted to know who would be responsible if something goes wrong.\n\nBut Helm said neither turned out to be a problem. Citizen responders who assist during a medical emergency are protected by Good Samaritan laws. Every state has these laws in place to protect people who help victims in public places.\n\nMore than 10,000 people have downloaded the app in Helm's community. He said that the app has gotten a lot of positive feedback.\n\n\"It keeps the public engaged,\" he said. \"Everyone has a smartphone nowadays, and now we have an avenue to get them to the right place at the right time.\"'"

            "title": "Court will decide if police need\u00a0 permission to search cellphones",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will consider the case of a California man whose smartphone got him in serious trouble. What they decide will affect everyone with a cellphone. These days, that means most of us.\n\nIn 2009, David Leon Riley's Samsung Instinct was searched by police. It was loaded with pictures, some of them suspicious-looking, and Riley got busted.\n\nThe police who searched Riley's phone did so without a warrant - that is, without special permission from a judge. The case will decide whether warrant-less searches of phones are legal.\n\nThe Supreme Court must decide if smartphones are covered by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That amendment - that is, addition or change - provides protection against unreasonable searches.\n\n## Making 18th-Century Rules Modern\n\nThe Court's decisions will update rules that were written long before smartphones existed.\n\nA modern smartphone, law professor Jeffrey L. Fisher noted, contains a lot of personal information. It is a window into our private lives. Police, he said, should not be allowed to poke through cellphones just to see what they can find.\n\nFisher is representing Riley, who is from San Diego. Riley's case will be heard along with a separate phone-search case. That case involves a man named Brima Wurie, whose flip-phone was searched without a warrant.\n\nThe outcome of the two cases could be very significant for both police and phone users.\n\nSome fear that a ruling against Riley and Wurie would make the secrets of cellphone owners far too easy to uncover. Ninety percent of U.S. adults now own cellphones. A growing number of those phones are smartphones, which can contain much more personal information.\n\n## How Much Is Fair Game?\n\nLaw enforcement officials are worried as well. Their fear is that they will lose an extremely valuable investigative tool.\n\nCalifornia's attorney general - the top lawyer for the state - argued that barring cellphone searches would be inconsistent. It is legal to seize certain kinds of information from an arrested person when they are \"in paper form.\" For example, photographs, videos, letters and lists of addresses are all fair game. Such material, the attorney general said, should not be given \"Fourth Amendment protection\" simply because it's on a cellphone.\n\nState and federal officials are urging the court to allow police to search smartphones.\n\nThe Riley and Wurie cases will be argued back to back on Tuesday morning. Both involve warrant-less searches of devices unimagined back in 1791, when the Fourth Amendment was approved.\n\n\"I think the Riley case, in particular, is incredibly important,\" lawyer Elizabeth B. Wydra said on Friday. \"It should be important for everyone who has a smartphone.\"\n\n## Two Search Stories\n\nRiley was pulled over by a San Diego police officer on Aug. 22, 2009, prosecutors and defense lawyers agree. The two sides describe him very differently, however. Fisher called Riley a \"college student.\" California officials called him \"a member of a San Diego Blood gang.\"\n\nPolice seized Riley's car because he was driving with a suspended license. In a search that followed, officers found two guns. A police officer then scrolled through Riley's unlocked phone. On it were video clips of gang fights, pictures of gang signs and clips of a red car allegedly used in an earlier gang shooting.\n\nConvicted on charges that included attempted murder, Riley was sentenced to prison for 15 years to life. The 23-year-old is currently in California's Kern Valley State Prison.\n\nThe Wurie case also involves a warrant-less search of a cellphone. After busting Wurie on drug and gun charges, Boston police checked his phone's call log, allowing them to see who he'd been talking to. Wurie was convicted in 2009, and is now serving a 262-month prison term.\n\nThe Riley case may prove to be the more important of the two. This is because it deals directly with the way modern smartphones can store so much personal information. An estimated 56 percent of U.S. adults were using smartphones last year.\n\n\"You're talking about a treasure trove of personal information,\" Wydra said. And it's \"the kind of information that we think of as deeply private.\"'"

            "text": "\tSometimes, great ideas pop up when you least expect them. That was the case for Snapchat. The company started as an idea for a class project at Stanford University. The idea was a cellphone app that would allow users to send their friends photos that would quickly disappear.\n\nThat was four years ago. And now, the idea that used to seem impossible has turned into a famous company known around the world. Snapchat is very successful. On Wednesday, the company received a $200 million investment from a major Chinese company called Alibaba. With Alibaba's investment, Snapchat is now worth $15 billion.\n\nThe money from Alibaba is a big thumbs-up for Snapchat. The company produces a phone app with a unique mix of social media features. It has turned into a major force in media, advertising and cellphones. The story of Snapchat is also a reminder of how quickly a company can rise from small beginnings to a major power in today's fast-paced app world.\n\n## \"Some Growing Pains\"\n\nSnapchat has dealt with a number of challenges along the way. According to one expert, the company has \"had some growing pains in their short journey.\"\n\nThe company has faced many troubles over the last few years. There was a court fight with a co-founder who left Snapchat. Then there were the inappropriate emails from another founder that leaked online for the public to read. Snapchat has had to deal with concerns about how people's private information got accidentally released too.\n\nThe company was also criticized after it rejected an offer from Facebook. It tried to buy Snapchat in 2013 for $3 billion. At the time, that much money seemed very high.\n\nEven with these challenges, Snapchat continues to be popular. It is among the top 10 most downloaded apps in dozens of countries.\n\nSnapchat was first released in July 2011.\n\n## Accent On Fast\n\nSnapchat quickly became popular among college students. It was the perfect app for sending images that users wanted to be seen fast and only for a few seconds. Now, users are finding more ways to engage with the platform.\n\nWhen he was sitting in class at Stanford University, Spiegel would monitor how many people were using the app. During one class, he saw one photo sent every five minutes, but by the end of the same class, it was one per second. Snapchat was growing fast so Spiegel dropped out of college just as investors became interested in funding the startup company.\n\nBy late 2012, more than 200 snaps, or pictures, were being sent per second, and by summer 2013 about 4,000 snaps were sent every second. Snapchat has raised at least $500 million more since then.\n\nNew Snapchat features have kept users coming back. Now, users can organize their picture posts into \"stories\" that disappear after 24 hours, instead of after a few seconds. Users can also share content publicly. Snapchat employees sort the public content based on major events, like the Grammys, or around locations, like a college campus.\n\n## Ads In Their Snapchats\n\nThe new features have given people who use Snapchat a unique experience. It combines the feel of Instagram and YouTube videos with a more social vibe.\n\nCNN even pays employees to create content for Snapchat, according to an official of the cable network.\n\nSome media organizations, including CNN, have started putting ads in their Snapchats.\n\nCute or funny videos are also popular and can draw millions of views. The makers of these short videos get paid tens of thousands of dollars from advertisers for mentioning or showing certain products in the clips.\n\nRight now, most people using Snapchat are teenagers and young adults. Some business experts say that the company needs to find a larger audience if it wants to be the next Facebook or YouTube.'"

            "text": "\tNick Stepka knew what gift would make his daughter's 3rd birthday a hit. It wasn't a toy or a doll.\n\nHe gave her a tablet - not a sleek new iPad or a hand-me-down Samsung, but one specifically designed for little ones. It even came with a purple protective casing and was loaded with kids' apps and games.\n\n\"Her eyes lit up when she opened it,\" said Stepka, 34, a Shakopee, Minn., father of three. \"Everything else got put to the side.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what tablet makers and companies that create children's entertainment were hoping for.\n\n## Thick Plastic Bumpers\n\nFor more and more people, traditional children's toys and games are not enough. Compared to two years ago, almost twice as many kids ages 8 and under now own mobile devices.\n\nChildren are also spending more time on these devices: 15 minutes a day on average last year, up from five minutes in 2011. Meanwhile, kids' use of televisions, video games and computers has declined.\n\nThat's the reason Jim Mitchell started Fuhu. The company makes tablets designed for kids ages 3 to 14.\n\n\"We were tired of giving our kids the iPad,\" he said. \"They wanted to play with all the games on the iPad, and it would come back all smudged, or if they dropped it, for heaven's sake, it would shatter.\"\n\nFuhu makes Nabi tablets, which sell for between $100 and $300. It had $200 million in sales last year.\n\nThe company is betting that demand will continue for devices packed with kid-friendly apps and thick plastic bumpers to prevent damage.\n\n## Apps And Shows\n\nKids can customize the machines with stickers featuring film and TV characters. They also get other extras, like alphabet letters that attach to the tablet. They can use the tablets to watch TV shows and movies, play games and explore the Web. Parents get to decide which apps, movies and websites their children can see.\n\nCompanies such as LeapFrog, Toys R Us and Samsung also sell devices for youngsters. Even traditional toy makers such as Mattel have entered the app business.\n\nHollywood has taken notice too. Walt Disney, DreamWorks Animation and Nickelodeon are putting out tablet and mobile apps.\n\nEducation-focused cable channel BabyFirstTV has unleashed 27 apps aimed at young children. Sharon Rechter helped start the channel. She said she expects demand for the apps to keep growing.\n\n\"Parents are constantly looking for good educational content,\" she said. \"Kids' apps and devices are definitely here to stay, and they're going to grow. Kids can learn from using a tablet, and they have fun with it.\"\n\nEntertainment companies and tablet makers are teaming up. For instance, BabyFirst has co-developed a series called \"Albert &amp; Junior\" specifically for use on Fuhu's tablets.\n\n## Getting The Cartoon Treatment\n\nFuhu also has made deals with Disney and Nickelodeon for special-edition tablets. And the company is taking the technology and entertainment relationship further with its next device, the DreamTab. It was built in partnership with DreamWorks Animation.\n\nThe $269 DreamTab will be released in some stores this month. It will become widely available in June.\n\nThe tablet includes animated interactive videos and games based on \"Shrek,\" \"Kung Fu Panda\" and \"Madagascar.\"\n\nDreamTab also comes with educational features. For example, it can teach kids how to draw and animate their favorite characters, create books and edit video. Even the parental controls get the cartoon treatment. A short video of a DreamWorks character tells children when it's time to take a break from the screen or shut down for the day.\n\n\"As a parent, you'd much rather have a penguin tell the kid it's time to go outside than make the parent take the tablet away,\" said Jim Mainard of DreamWorks Animation. \"That's a big win for parents.\"\n\nStepka doesn't plan to switch to the new DreamTab: He already owns six Nabi devices. Although his children certainly use them to have fun, he said, the most important thing to him is that they learn and stay safe while using the technology.\n\n\"We don't want the tablets to raise our kids for us,\" he said. \"But I don't want\" them to miss out on \"using the technology to educate themselves.\"'"

            "text": "\tBOSTON, Mass. - Moshe Kai Cavalin has two college degrees, yet he isn't old enough to vote. He flies airplanes, yet he isn't old enough to drive a car alone.\n\nLife is filled with contrasts for Moshe, a 17-year-old from San Gabriel, California, who has raced by major life events. He graduated from community college at age 11. Four years later, he had a bachelor's degree in math from the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThis year, he started online classes to get a master's degree in cybersecurity through Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. He decided to put that goal on hold for a couple of terms, though. He is too busy working for NASA. He helps develop surveillance technology that will let NASA watch over its airplanes and drones. Drones are unmanned aircraft usually piloted with a remote control by a person on the ground.\n\n##Praise For Multicultural Parents\n\nBetween all that, Moshe has racked up an exhausting list of extracurricular feats. He just published his second book. He drew experience from being bullied and from other young people's stories as well. He plans to have his airplane pilot's license by the year's end. At his family's home near Los Angeles, he has a trove of trophies from martial arts tournaments.\n\nStill, Moshe insists that he's more ordinary than people think. He credits his parents for teaching him well and giving him the freedom to pick his after-school activities. His varied interests come from his varied cultural background, he said. His mother is from Taiwan and his father from Brazil.\n\n\"My case isn't that special. It's just a combination of parenting and motivation and inspiration,\" he says after a recent shift at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. \"I tend to not compare myself that often to other people. I just try to do the best I can.\"\n\n##An Early Passion For Planes\n\nHis parents say he was always a quick study. At 4 months, he pointed to a jet in the sky and said the Chinese word for airplane, his first word. He hit the limits of his home schooling after studying trigonometry, a high-level math class, at age 7. Then his mom started driving him to community college.\n\nDaniel Judge is a math professor who taught Moshe for two years at East Los Angeles College.\n\n\"I think most people just think he's a genius. They believe it just comes naturally,\" Judge said.\n\nMoshe has worked harder than any other student Judge has ever taught, he added.\n\n##A Math Maven Finds His Calling\n\nHis rapid rise, however, has not been without twists. Early in college, he dreamed of being an astrophysicist. Those space scientists study stars, planets and galaxies. When he started taking advanced physics classes, though, his interest waned. His fascination in cryptography led him toward computer science.\n\nThe art of writing or solving codes has been a better fit, Moshe said. He was surprised when NASA offered him work after rejecting him in the past because of his age. Moshe was perfect for a project that combines math, computers and aircraft technology, says Ricardo Arteaga, his boss and mentor at NASA.\n\n\"I needed an intern who knew software and knew mathematical algorithms,\" Arteaga adds. \"And I also needed a pilot who could fly it on a Cessna.\"\n\nAround the office, Moshe is a quiet worker with an understated sense of humor, Arteaga says. They laugh about typical scientist stuff. His daily work at NASA has included running simulations, or tests, of airplanes and drones that are on course to collide. He helps find ways to route them to safety.\n\n\"He's really sharp in mathematics,\" Arteaga says. \"What we're trying to bring out more is his intuitive skills.\"\n\n##He Shuns A Certain Label\n\nIn conversation, Moshe chooses his words with care. He is not easily excited, at least until he discusses his distaste for being called a certain word.\n\n\"One word I don't take too kindly is genius,\" he said. \"Genius is just kind of taking it too far.\"\n\nAfter he finishes his master's degree from Brandeis, Moshe hopes to get a master's in business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Later, he wants to start his own cybersecurity company.\n\nFor now, though, he is counting down the days until his 18th birthday, when he will be able to get a California driver's license. Moshe currently lives away from home to work at NASA. He relies on his landlord for rides to the grocery store, or he takes a taxi. His older co-workers drive him to work every day.\n\nAs for the other teenage stuff, Moshe says he'll wait until he gets his doctorate to find a girlfriend. He's only half-joking. A 17-year-old only has so much time in a day.'"

            "title": "China crushed protests 25 years ago, and won't let its people talk of it ",
            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - China's Tianamen Square changed forever during a few weeks in spring 1989. Hu Yaobang had just died and young people went to march on the square in mourning. Yaobang was a popular leader in China because he had changed many old rules and was making the government more modern.\n\nMore and more protesters arrived over the coming weeks, eventually numbering hundreds of thousands. They demanded freedom of speech and of the press, and even built a Statue of Liberty figure called the Goddess of Democracy.\n\nA sense grew worldwide that the Chinese government would soon be toppled.\n\nInstead, on June 4, the government ordered the military to clear the square. Army units advanced from every direction, opening fire on protesters, bystanders and people in nearby buildings. An accurate death toll has never been reached. Estimates range from a few hundred to a few thousand.\n\n## \"May 35th\"\n\nHistorian Maura Cunningham says that today there's only one safe way to hold an online discussion about what happened in Tiananmen Square: You have to speak in code.\n\nDon't mention \"June 4th,\" the date that tanks rolled against unarmed protesters. Instead, try \"May 35th\" - a count of that month's 31 days plus four in June. It's a way to avoid the lurking presence of the government, and to prevent what you've written from being removed.\n\nThe game being played between citizen and government isn't exactly cat-and-mouse, said Cunningham.\n\nIt's more like whack-a-mole: Each time the government whacks forbidden online speech, it pops up again somewhere else.\n\n\"The Internet is a bigger and bigger part of life in China,\" Cunningham said in an interview. \"But it's becoming more and more complicated.\"\n\nBeijing-based reporter Louisa Lim has also studied the treatment of Tiananmen in China. She described the Communist Party's successful effort to scrub the history and memory of Tiananmen from society.\n\n\"How can people have forgotten something that occurred in living memory?\" she asked.\n\n## A Famous Photo\n\nIt turns out, it's not that difficult. Accounts of the mass killing don't appear in Chinese history books, while Internet searches for \"Tiananmen\" bring up nothing but tourist information. And people, she said, face punishment or harassment if they bring up the protests.\n\nLim showed the famous photo of the \"Tank Man\" - the lone figure who stood up and stopped an advancing line of tanks after the killings. Then she described an experiment: She showed the photo to 100 Chinese students at four top universities. Only 15 could identify the picture, and several were nervous to have that knowledge.\n\n\"It looks like Tiananmen,\" one told her. \"But it can't be.\"\n\nToday, the huge square in Beijing's center is heavily monitored. Its open plain is crossed each day by thousands of tourists - and by plainclothes and uniformed police.\n\n\"It's vital that we keep the memory and lessons of those weeks alive,\" China expert James Carter said. The purpose of remembering, he said, is \"partly to understand China more fully.\" But it is also \"to prevent the people who died standing up for their beliefs from being erased from history.\"\n\nIn today's China, it is foolhardy to gather publicly to demand democratic reforms. Opposition has moved online - but there too it is being blocked more and more.\n\nCunningham has seen the change first-hand.\n\n## Blocking Websites\n\nBack in the mid-2000s, she noticed that a few U.S. and British websites were difficult to find. Today, more and more are blocked - Facebook is, and so are Twitter, YouTube and The New York Times.\n\nIt's the big online discussion groups and most-read Internet posters that draw government attention, Cunningham said. As in this country, a single, potentially controversial post can easily pass unnoticed.\n\nIn the last year there's been a definite tightening online and a crackdown on those who voice complaints. The uncertainty over who else may be reading has pushed many discussions onto networks like WeChat, where users talk only with people they know.\n\n\"It limits the spread of the idea, but people feel safer,\" Cunningham said.\n\nMany people think that all online complaints about the government are blocked in China, but actually it's more complicated than that, she said. What's acceptable today might be forbidden tomorrow.\n\n\"The line is constantly shifting,\" Cunningham said. \"It's really hard to know what will get you in trouble.\"'"

            "text": "\tMore and more people are deciding to sell their old cellphones after they buy a new one.\n\nBest Buy Co. Inc. launched a trade-in program in 2009 for things like cellphones, video games and the computers to play them on. It's gotten more popular every year, and now Best Buy is accepting more than 11,000 different devices. The number of devices traded in \"has doubled every year since 2009,\" Jeff Shelman, a Best Buy spokesman, wrote in an email.\n\nThe numbers keep growing as well at Pawn America's 29 Midwest stores. In 2013, sales of used cellphones were up by more than one-tenth. Tablets sales increased by two times.\n\nThe secondhand market for electronics is \"super-hot,\" said Karl Hattman of Pawn America. People who want cellphones or video games \"are more accepting of buying secondhand goods,\" he said.\n\n## Unloading The Old\n\nFortunately for bargain hunters, there are also plenty of people who want the latest and greatest technology. They are willing to get rid of a phone from a year or two ago. With the value of the devices ranging from $50 to $200 or more, they aren't sitting forgotten in a drawer anymore.\n\nPeople are now getting new smartphones every 12 to 18 months. It's less often for tablets and laptops, said Louis Ramirez at DealNews.com.\n\nPeople with cellphones, computers and video games are adapting as well. They are trying to keep their devices in  good shape, and keep the original box and manual, Ramirez said. They've learned that they get more money or credit for them if they want to sell them.\n\nPeople have a lot of choices to unload their old, but not too old, technology. Pawnshops have been a popular go-to for many years. Retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Radio Shack have gotten into the act as well. They offer store credit in exchange for used electronics online or in stores.\n\nMany websites, such as Gazelle.com, BuyBackWorld.com and Nextworth.com, will pay money to people who mail in used devices.  As a result, companies such as Usell.com have popped up to list bids from several resellers.\n\n## 600 Offers A Second\n\nAnthony Scarsella, who's in charge of gadgets or cool devices for Gazelle.com, gave an example. He recalled when Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted the iPhone 5S and 5C models. Within an hour, Gazelle began getting 600 offers a second on earlier models.\n\nManufacturers are joining in because they can resell the old devices. Apple offers store credit while Samsung offers a Visa card with money on it. \"Why let Amazon take their lunch\" when manufacturers can buy these devices directly from those who own them?\" Ramirez said.\n\nOne retailer is going a step further. NYT Franchise Co. in Wayzata, Minn., just opened Device Pitstop in Minnetonka, Minn. It buys and sells used and refurbished smartphones, laptops, tablets and all-in-one computers from brands including Apple, Android, Acer, Compaq, Dell, HP, IBM, Sony and Toshiba. Laptop prices range from $99 to $500. Tablets go from $159 to $400, and smartphones from $100 to $300.\n\nThe retailer offers a number of services, doing repairs, upgrades and servicing. Workers inspect devices in the store. They make common repairs such as fixing cracked screens in the store, usually within a few days.\n\nA lot of people think small electronics can't be fixed and they can't sell them, said Dave Brennan. He teaches people how to run good businesses. But many people are starting to realize that even a tablet with a cracked screen may have value.\n\n## Repairs And Warranties\n\nBrennan said retailers need to make customers feel safe about buying used devices. They should hire workers who know a lot about electronics. And they should offer some sort of a warranty. Businesses that sell cars are now offering warranties and cars that are guaranteed to have been checked to make sure they are in good shape, Brennan said.\n\nPeople want to know that if they buy something used, any problems will be taken care of. Device Pitstop includes a 90-day warranty on all products, said Mike Smith. He is one of the heads of the company.\n\nTerri Harris took her work iPad into Device Pitstop to find out how much it would cost to fix a cracked screen. \"I didn't even know if it was possible,\" said Harris, of Maple Plain, Minn. \"I've had clear tape holding it together for a year.\"\n\nFor $150 the crack could be repaired. But Harris had to check with her boss to see if it was OK.\n\nDevice Pitstop is a franchised retailer with seven stores in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Lexington, Ky. Smith said the company hopes to add 300 nationwide within five years.\n\nSmith is confident the used electronics market will continue to grow. \"It used to be young males, but now we're getting an older demographic and families, too,\" he said. \"They like being able to see and test used items in person, and getting a warranty. You won't get that on eBay.\"'"

Dr. Sweet runs the University's Medical School Simulation Programs.\n\n## Video Game Generation\n\nSoon, surgeons will be able to use devices that create images of people's bodies - like MRIs - to create custom models of their patients' diseased organs. Surgeons are doctors who perform operations on patients. They will eventually practice tricky operations before ever cutting the patient open.\n\n\"Have you ever seen a pitcher not warm up before their first pitch, or a musician not warm up before they go on stage? Never!\" Sweet said. \"Why would a surgeon be any different?\"\n\nAn added benefit: Simulators collect information that can be used to research methods of surgery and detect common errors. For instance, a 2011 study used a training simulator for laparoscopic surgery - a type of surgery that doesn't require making big cuts. It found a \"hangover effect.\" Doctors who had gotten drunk the night before an operation performed more poorly at surgery.\n\nUntil simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for doctors to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients. They had to work under the watchful eye of an older surgeon.\n\nSweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning to do surgery.\n\n\"Being from the video game generation, I thought that there might be a good way to do it with a video game,\" he said.\n\nSweet dropped by the school's Human Interface Technology lab and helped build a simulator. But early simulators were crude compared to the ones being developed now.\n\n## Getting Instant Feedback\n\nSweet credits some of the improvements to information in the University's human tissues database.\n\n\"When a patient dies, we get consent to harvest little bits of tissue. Not whole organs, just little bits of tissue. And we rapidly run them through tests.\" They do mechanical testing, electrical testing, and other types of testing.\n\n\"You need to understand the object you're simulating,\" he said.\n\nYunhe Shen, a professor, is in charge of developing algorithms, or math formulas, for the simulators. They provide users with instant feedback. It imitates what surgeons would feel and see if they were operating on a live patient.\n\nSimulators could play a growing role in doctor training. Medical residents are limited in the number of hours they can work in hospitals to avoid errors due to fatigue. Residents are doctors who have finished medical school and are training in hospitals to get more real-life experience.\n\nDr. Travis Pagliara, a third-year resident, said the machines are incredibly lifelike.\n\n\"I'm moving in every direction of space, whether I twist my wrist, whether I push in, pull back, both hands are doing things separately,\" he said. The way in which he moves his body affects what happens on the screen.\n\n## Learning From Mistakes\n\nPagliara, 29, had trained on a simulator before he stepped into the operating room. Then he had to perform a type of surgery for the first time, under Sweet's supervision. Normally, Sweet said, first-timers last less than a minute before he has to take over.\n\n\"Travis blew me away,\" Sweet said, praising Pagliara's natural skills. He added that the simulator made an important difference.\n\nTravis agreed. \"I wouldn't have lasted 15 seconds if I hadn't done that,\" he said.\n\nResidents in neurosurgery, or brain surgery, get to train on a simulator called NeuroTouch Cranio. It was developed for surgeons. They get to practice with a device that uses sound waves to liquefy brain tumors and then sucks away the remains.\n\n\"They have more self-confidence and maybe more importantly, they learn their own limitations,\" said David Hananel, who helps run the medical school's simulation programs. \"We actually are trying to teach them the errors, the mistakes, the things that shouldn't be done.\"\n\nHe added, \"Let them do it\" so they can see how serious mistakes can be. \"And then show them how to recover.\"'"

            "title": "Virtual reality has some problems to fix",
            "text": "\tSAN JOSE, Calif. - The beauty of virtual reality (VR) is that it can take users to new places. Putting on a headset allows you to step through a digital door into different worlds.\n\nEarlier this month, two big companies in the VR business announced their new technology. Oculus released more information about its VR headset. Sony also provided more details about the launch of its own VR headset, known as Project Morpheus.\n\nThis technology is supposed to be available for sale in 2016. Before this can happen, a few major problems need to be fixed.\n\nJack McCauley is the inventor of the Oculus headset. Oculus began in 2012. Since then, it has established itself as one of the VR industry leaders. It was so successful that the company was purchased by Facebook for $2 billion last year.\n\nMcCauley guided the progress of the Oculus headset from start to finish. He fixed many problems it had with head-tracking technology. This is a technology that allows the VR software to determine where the user's head is located in virtual space. McCauley has also fixed problems with the liquid crystal display (LCD) screens used in the device. Many other problems with the VR technology still remain, however.\n\n## VR Headsets Can Be Powerful ... Or Sickening\n\nVR headsets can sometimes make their users sick. McCauley said this feeling occurs because of the difference between what your eyes are seeing and what your ears are feeling and hearing. Our ears and eyes work together to keep our body balanced. If one of these senses experiences something different than what the other experiences, it can sometimes make us feel ill.\n\nWhen done correctly, VR can produce a wonderful sense of speed and power. When it is not done correctly, VR can make a user very sick. McCauley thinks Oculus can solve these problems.\n\nThere is also a problem with the pixels. Pixels are the smallest building blocks of any digital image. It takes many of them to make a single image. Because the screen is so close to a player's eyes in VR headsets, users are able to see the individual pixels that makes up images. It can be like looking through a screen door. This ruins the experience of entering into the virtual world.\n\n## Tweaking Hardware, Software Will Take Time\n\nThe problems of VR technology have to do with the hardware of the headsets and the software of the computer programs. Game developers must learn new ways to make games that end motion sickness and improve gamer experience.\n\nThis will take some time. Nick Whiting is the head game creator at Epic Games. He said his team has found that it is best to have an object near the user at all times. This gives users a frame of reference for distance in the virtual world and makes them less nauseous.\n\nDevelopers also need to be able to guide a player's eyes. They will be using spatial 3-D audio to do this. This is a technology that allows VR headsets to make users believe they are in a 3-D world, hearing things they can't necessarily see, like surround sound in movies. Audio technology will be used alongside physical touch signals from controllers. A rumble from a controller can even make players' brains believe they fired a gun.\n\nVR headsets don't work well with every type of video game. Flight and racing games work well with VR, but the same cannot be said for first-person shooter games, which move a bit too fast for current VR technology.\n\n\"They will have to be reinvented,\" said Richard Marks, one of the lead game developers at Sony.\n\n## VR Can Connect From Afar\n\nAside from video games, there is also opportunity to use VR technology to connect people who live long distances apart. VR gives users a sense of physical presence. Two friends who are hundreds of miles away can feel like they are right next to each other in the virtual world.\n\nThere is also potential to use this technology in the worlds of architecture and music. Instead of an architectural company showing customers models or still images of buildings, the customer can put on a headset and go on a virtual tour.\n\nSomeday, it might even be possible to to attend concerts through VR so viewers can feel as though they were at the show.\n\nVR will bring people to all kinds of \"cool spaces,\" Marks says.'"

            "text": "\tPITTSBURGH - High-tech detective work by Carnegie Mellon students uncovered new images by artist Andy Warhol.\n\nJust the possibility that something new by the King of Pop Art had been discovered was enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world.\n\nThe 28 images were apparently created and stored by Warhol on nearly-unreadable computer disks almost 30 years ago. They were created on Warhol's Commodore Amiga computer. The newly-discovered images include a version of \"The Birth of Venus\" by 15th century artist Sandro Botticelli, a Warhol self-portrait, and a Campbell's soup can - Warhol was famous for his soup cans. The students found versions of some of his other most iconic artworks, such as a banana and actress Marilyn Monroe.\n\nIt will take more research and debate before the discovery's historic value is clear. But the high interest is understandable for one of the world's most productive and studied artists, said Matt Wrbican. He is a Warhol expert and the Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist.\n\n\"It's something that's new,\" he said, \"and that doesn't happen very often with Warhol.\"\n\n## \"Learning A New Tool\"\n\nThe Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Mellon University and the Carnegie Museum of Art revealed the story Thursday morning.\n\nWithin hours of the discovery hitting the Internet, Wrbican heard from someone with doubts that Warhol created the images.\n\nA man who worked with the now-closed Amiga World magazine called after reading a story about the discovery. He said he \"doesn't think Warhol actually made a lot of those images,\" Wrbican said. The magazine published a story in 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer.\n\nBut even if Warhol had help making the images, they would still help to understand Warhol as an artist.\n\n\"Like a lot of his work, it was a collaboration,\" Wrbican said.\n\nStill, even if Warhol had created the images all by himself, Wrbican noted, \"I want to emphasize we're not calling these artwork. It was just Warhol learning a new tool.\"\n\nWarhol is famous for predicting that \"everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes.\" Born in Pittsburgh, he died in 1987 in New York City. His paintings now fetch more than $100 million at auctions.\n\n## \"Painting\" On An Amiga\n\nThe museum knew it had Warhol's Amiga computer and floppy disks for some time. Floppy disks were computer storage devices that held information. They have been replaced by CDs. Pulling information from floppy disks, especially the early ones, can be incredibly difficult. Wrbican said he had wanted to look through Warhol's computer and set of disks for a while, but couldn't find the time.\n\nIt took a modern, multimedia artist - and self-professed Warhol fanatic - to finally get the ball rolling.\n\nIn 2011, New York City artist Cory Arcangel was doing a show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. He was asked if he had any ideas for any Pittsburgh-focused work.\n\nOne of the ideas Arcangel proposed was based on a YouTube video of Warhol from 1985. Warhol was \"painting\" rock singer Debbie Harry on an Amiga computer.\n\nCommodore had used the video to promote the launch of the Amiga. It was the first advanced multimedia art graphics computer.\n\nArcangel then called a friend at Carnegie Mellon to see if he knew anyone with any retro-computer expertise.\n\nAs it turns out, the university had an active and energetic Computer Club. Its members were especially interested in outdated computer technology and how it evolved.\n\n\"We were not optimistic when we first saw the floppy disks,\" said Keith Bare. He is a former Carnegie student. The disks had the computer's operating system on them. They were not personal information \"disks with something handwritten on them like 'Andy Warhol's images' on them,\" he said.\n\n## A Program Called KryoFlux\n\nIt turned out the disks and the computer were early versions. That made accessing the information on them that much more difficult. The students created their own program. They also used a program called a KryoFlux to allow a modern computer to \"talk to\" a floppy disk. Combing the two, the team managed to pull the images from the disk and save them.\n\n\"But I think we're going to have a lot of this in the future unless we start saving files in very standard file formats,\" said Michael Dile. He was deeply involved in the project. People, business, government and organizations all may have information stored on old computer formats.\n\nPeople might think the museum could sell new computer images by Warhol for a lot of money. But Wrbican said even if Warhol did create them, it's not so easy to make money from the newfound work.\n\nThe museum might not even be able to release the Marilyn Monroe image, for example, he said. The people who own the rights to Monroe's image might sue the museum if it did. Anyone who wants to use the actress's picture may need to get permission from her heirs.\n\nSimilar copyright issues affect much of his work. Warhol typically used publicly available images or products.\n\nMoreover, Wrbican said, \"We don't really see them as Warhol's artwork, so I don't think we're going to be putting them out there on coffee cups to sell anytime soon.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Tara Montgomery tried rowing once in high school. It didn't hook her. She only went to rowing practice after her mom offered her an iPhone as a bribe.\n\nTara's mom hoped that her daughter would become a skilled rower and have a chance at a college rowing scholarship.\n\nFour years later, Montgomery, an 18-year-old high school senior, has gotten an iPhone and much more. She will be going to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville on an athletic scholarship.\n\n\"I have a single mother. She could not afford for me to go to a four-year university,\" Montgomery said. Without the scholarship, Montgomery would have taken out student loans or gone to a cheaper community college instead.\n\nCollege sports are doing very well. Their success is thanks to money from TV contracts and the increasing use of athletics as a tool to attract new students. Women's teams are enjoying this success as well.\n\nFootball and basketball account for most of men's scholarships. Women's scholarships are spread more evenly among many different sports. This gives an advantage to female high school athletes who play certain sports.\n\n## Bowling: 53 Colleges, 358 Scholarships\n\nWhen Julia Bond started bowling at age 11, her father gave her some important advice. He pointed out bowlers who were doing well and told her to copy them.\n\nIt turned out to be great advice. Seven years later, Bond, now a high school senior, is one of the best high school bowlers in the country. She has bowled two perfect games, each one is 12 strikes in a row.\n\nMany colleges wanted her. In November, she accepted a full scholarship offer from the University of Nebraska .\n\n\"I enjoy the competitiveness,\" said Bond, who last month led her high school team to its second straight state title. \"Bowling is a team sport but you still have to perform by yourself. If something goes wrong, you can't blame anybody but yourself.\"\n\n## Equestrian: 23 Colleges, 540 Scholarships\n\nTalented high school athletes often receive many phone calls, text messages and personal visits from interested schools. That's not how it happened for Hayley Banas, 18, who rides horses for her high school.\n\nBanas liked the program at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and reached out to them.\n\n\"Initially, she found me,\" said coach Natalie Burton. \"She was very enthusiastic about college equestrian, SMU in particular, and she emailed and called a lot, definitely something I recommend. She got my attention.\"\n\nCollege equestrian sports involve jumping and a display of riding skills, often on horses the athletes have never ridden. Building the skills that judges look for can take years of practice, Burton said.\n\nBanas took her sport seriously. She spent two hours a day on one of her family's horses. When she got to high school, she spent months getting home-schooled so she could live and train in Florida, where top riders compete in the winter.\n\n## Rowing: 106 Colleges, 2,000 Scholarships\n\nKate Stolar tried a lot of sports growing up, but she wasn't very good at any of them. In T-ball, she always stood with her glove above her head, so her dad nicknamed her \"the Statue of Liberty.\" She didn't make the high school dance team either.\n\nAt first, she assumed she wouldn't be good at rowing. As a high school freshman, she enjoyed the teamwork of the sport, but thought she was too short to compete against taller, stronger girls.\n\nBut then she got a chance to be the coxswain - the person who steers the boat and shouts directions and encouragement to the rowers. It turned out to fit her perfectly.\n\n\"You have to be small, you have to be light. But beyond that you have to be somebody who's really loud, who likes to be in charge, who thinks under pressure,\" said her coach, Mike Wallin.\n\nStolar, 17, used that outgoing personality when she was searching for a scholarship. She sent out tons of emails, made many phone calls, and chatted up coaches at competitions.\n\nHer efforts paid off in November, when she accepted an athletic scholarship that will pay for her books at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. It's a small scholarship, but a welcome reward for an unlikely athletic career.\n\n\"The fact that I'm even a (Division 1) athlete just blows my mind,\" she said. \"I'm not that athletic but I'm a very competitive person.\"'"

            "text": "b\"Head injuries can happen in an instant, but their effects last much longer.\n\nA student could hit their head in a car accident or while playing sports. If their brain is hurt, they might have problems in school - even weeks after the accident.\n\nA journal for doctors called Pediatrics just published a new report about students and brain injuries called concussions. Researchers found that almost all teens who experience brain injuries have problems going back to school. They are tired and have headaches that make learning very difficult.\n\n## Students In Toughest Classes Struggle The Most\n\nStudents with mild concussions usually recover in one to three weeks. Others take longer to heal. Most students whose brain injuries last longer than four weeks say they have trouble taking notes and doing their homework.\n\nFor the Pediatrics report, researchers studied 349 students. All of the students' brains had  been injured within the past four weeks. Almost 70 percent of them still showed signs of brain injury. They had headaches and dizziness and mood swings. They also had trouble concentrating and being around bright lights.\n\nStudents taking the most difficult classes - especially math classes - seemed to have the most trouble. Students whose moods changed because of their accidents also had a very hard time.\n\n## Fast Healers Still Have Trouble\n\nEven the students whose brains healed the fastest still had problems in school. About a third of the students who recovered quickly had headaches and concentration problems that hurt their schoolwork.\n\nResearchers say schools need to do more to help students with brain injuries. They say many schools don't realize that students with concussions need some of the same kinds of help they give students with learning disabilities.\n\nThe study recommends that doctors write out special plans for students' families to give their schools. Each plan should give the school detailed instructions about how to help the injured student.\n\n## Injured Students Need To Do Less Schoolwork\n\nWhile they are getting better, the injured student might not spend as much time at school as other students do. They will probably need to take breaks and do less homework. It might be a good idea to reschedule some of their tests.\n\nNoise can also be a problem for students with brain injuries. Teachers might need to let an injured student leave class a few minutes early so they can change classes while the hallways are empty. They might also prefer to eat lunch in a quiet place by themselves.\""

            "text": "\tAcross the nation, there has been a growing awareness of the danger of concussions in young athletes. [Concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) are minor brain injuries that result from blows to the head. Particularly if they occur repeatedly, they can have serious long-term effects.\n\nIn response to this growing concern, the White House on Wednesday presented several new efforts. The goal is to help prevent and more effectively treat concussions in children.\n\nOfficials announced that $65 million had been pledged to pay for these efforts.\n\nThe National College Athletic Association (NCAA), which makes the rules for college sports, contributed $30 million. Another $25 million came from the National Football League (NFL). And $10 million was a gift from the New York Giants football team's co-owner, Steve Tisch.\n\n## Starting Programs And Improving Others\n\nTisch's contribution will help get a national tracking system for concussions off the ground.\n\n\"Hopefully, 20 years from today, athletes won't be discovering\" head injuries they got years earlier \"playing in high school and college,\" Tisch said. \"This is kind of a new frontier.\"\n\nTisch's contribution will expand a program founded in 2012. So far, that program has treated 600 young patients with brain injuries. It has also studied the aftereffects of concussions in student athletes.\n\n\"This commitment will launch our program to the next level,\" said the program's leader, Dr. Christopher Giza. He said the program will now be able to reach more students. Its goal will be to improve treatment and to learn more about the longer-term effects of concussion.\n\n## Head Injuries Can Have Many Consequences\n\nEarlier studies have shown that concussions can cause serious long-term problems. Among these are learning problems, mental health problems and even dementia. This has made parents uncomfortable about allowing their children to play several sports.\n\nIn late 2013, President Barack Obama revealed that he shared that concern: If he had a son, the president said, he would not let him play pro football.\n\nNonetheless, the Obamas take a strong interest in sports. Indeed, one of their goals is to get children to be more physically active. To help make sure sports are as safe as possible, the president has been eager to boost research on concussions.\n\nA major scientific report on concussions was issued last autumn. It declared that far too little is known about the effects of repeated blows to the developing brain.\n\nThe report recommended that leagues, coaches and parents follow certain guidelines: A child who has been hit hard in the head should be banned from playing until he or she has been examined by a doctor. And safety rules should be strictly followed. For instance, head-to-head contact in football and blindside hits to the head in hockey should not be allowed.\n\n## Concussion Injuries Have Increased\n\nSome researchers believe that the young brain recovers more quickly from bumps and injuries than the adult brain does. Others fear the opposite: Because the young brain is still developing, they say, repeated blows may be more damaging. Much of a young brain's wiring does not have the protective, fatty coating seen in older brains.\n\nOver the years, there has been a steady increase in the number of concussions reported. In 2001 about 150,000 people under the age of 19 were treated for concussions. By 2009, that number had risen to 250,000. A recent NCAA survey of 15 college sports showed that between 1989 and 2004 the rate of reported concussions doubled.\n\n## Safety First\n\nOther new efforts to combat concussions include the following:\n\n-The NCAA and the Department of Defense will spend $30 million on the most extensive research to date on concussions. Another goal of this effort will be to change attitudes. For many athletes, blows to the head are seen as dings to be \"shaken off.\"\n\n-The NFL will spend $25 million to promote youth sports safety. The league says it will seek to increase the number of athletic trainers in schools. It will also work to educate parents about sports safety.\n\n-The National Institutes of Health will launch a long-term study of concussions. Specifically, it will examine the effects of repeated blows to the head.\n\n-The National Institute of Standards and Technology will spend $5 million to develop advanced materials for helmets. Hopefully, such materials will provide better protection against concussion.'"

Guinea is where the outbreak of the deadly Ebola disease started. To protect their players, Togo is asking that the match be moved to another country.\n\nThe soccer match is part of the African Cup. It is the biggest soccer tournament in Africa and it happens every year. Soccer officials fear the spread of the painful and contagious disease could ruin the African Cup's final qualifying round. The winners of the qualifying round will get to play in the finals in Morocco.\n\nEbola has killed nearly 1,000 people in West Africa. More than 300 people are believed to have died from the virus in the African country of Guinea. After spreading from Guinea, it traveled to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Most recently, people have been getting sick in Nigeria.\n\n## Togo Not Endangering Its Players\n\nGames involving Sierra Leone are already being looked at. The country said it would not host any soccer matches for now because of Ebola.\n\nTogo's request to move the match would affect the final group stage in Guinea. It is set to take place the first week of September. Togo's soccer officials said that its players feared traveling to Guinea. Togo said it would not \"put in danger\" the lives of its players and officials.\n\nTogo and Sierra Leone want to move qualifying games away from countries struggling with Ebola. The Confederation of African Football is in charge of the tournament. It has not decided whether to move the matches.\n\nSierra Leone was supposed to hold matches in its own country. A public health emergency has been declared in Sierra Leone. All soccer has been stopped there after nearly 300 people died. Now it wants to play its matches in other countries.\n\n## Where Can Sierra Leone Play?\n\nTo be fair, it wants those games to take place in countries not playing against them. Possible countries could include Gambia, Morocco or Senegal.\n\nThe teams from Sierra Leone and Guinea may also face problems traveling to matches. Last month, the African island nation of Seychelles prevented the Sierra Leone team from entering its country because it feared the players could bring in Ebola.\n\nAfter refusing to let the Sierra Leone team in, Seychelles was forced to call the game a loss. It also lost its chance to play in the finals.\n\nSierra Leone is due to play big-name teams Ivory Coast and Cameroon, as well as Congo, in the last round of qualifying. The matches will run from early September to mid-November. Guinea was placed in a group with Ghana, Togo and Uganda.\n\nThe qualifying matches will decide the 15 teams at the African Cup of Nations.

            "title": "Once a top pro football draft pick, athlete turns artist",
            "text": "\tAaron Maybin played football for the National Football League (NFL). Then, at 27, he retired from the game and reinvented himself as an artist.\n\nIt was the summer of 2013, and Maybin had just been let go by the Cincinnati Bengals, his third NFL team. He was ready to go to Indianapolis, Indiana, to try out for a new team.\n\nThe player from Baltimore, Maryland, had once been the NFL's 11th overall draft pick. The NFL draft is an yearly event where NFL teams pick new players. It is an opportunity for teams to choose some of the best college players in the world. Now, he was unemployed. His NFL career had lasted four years.\n\nAt the last minute, Maybin changed his mind about football and chose art instead. \"I couldn't even bring myself to pack my bags,\" he says.\n\n## He Paints People Who Inspired Him\n\nMaybin says that the things he cared about had changed. He was more interested in being a father and provider for his family. \"The community work I'm doing, the artwork and the messages I wanted to get out,\" became more important to him, he says.\n\nThe athlete-turned-artist tells his story from a leather couch in his studio. His paintings are on the walls around him. They show images of people who helped and inspired him, the struggles of race, and love, hope and disappointment.\n\nSplashes of dry paint spatter the floor, and an incense stick burns near a set of barbells, releasing a pleasant smell into the air. A movie plays in the background with no sound. On the floor are jumbo boxes of diapers for his new baby, Aria, one of Maybin's three children.\n\nThere are news articles that called Maybin one of the biggest failures in recent draft history. One news article said, \"It's quite possible that Maybin is the worst player in the NFL.\" Still, he looks back on his short NFL career without regret.\n\n## Football Eased Money Worries\n\nSince he earned $14 million playing football, now Maybin can spend time with his kids without worrying about money, and do his favorite kind of work. \"As far as I'm concerned, I'm really living the true American dream,\" he says. The artist wants people to know that the NFL dream is not exactly what it seems. He especially wants to get the message to young African-Americans.\n\nThe artist grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, where his father, Mike, worked for the fire department. From an early age, Maybin expressed himself through art more easily than through words. He says that he inherited his artistic talent from his mother, Constance, who died in childbirth when Maybin was 6 years old. \"I was at a pivotal moment. A lot of people would use losing your mother like that as an excuse,\" Maybin says.\n\nHis father remarried, and Maybin's stepmother, Violette Grant, understood the way he used art to process his emotions. Maybin had struggled to read as a young child, but she patiently sat with him as they worked their way through a \"Lion King\" book. Something clicked, and he became a willing reader.\n\n## \"Goofy Kid\" Grows Up Strong\n\nMaybin also sang in the choir, played the saxophone and acted in school plays, activities that he says did not exactly throw him in with the cool kids. \"Art is not the typical passion for an African-American kid growing up in Baltimore, especially not for a boy. I was an awkward, outcast, goofy kid,\" he says.\n\nMaybin says that as his athletic ability became known, his art suddenly became popular with the same people who used to pick on him. The unexpected change in people's opinions bothered him, because it seemed so wrong.\n\nMaybin believes that young people are categorized too early and it limits their futures, a problem he ponders when he thinks about his 2-year-old son, Arian. Maybin says: \"He's kind of told what he's going to be by everybody else. He's big, so it's 'Oh, he's going to play sports. You're going to be a football player and go to the NFL.' People tell my son that all the time, and I clap back at them like nah, he's going to do whatever he wants to do.\"\n\nMaybin helps young people when he is not painting. He started a group called Project Mayhem, named for \"Mayhem,\" his nickname during his football-playing days. Maybin began the group as a way to provide opportunities for students at Baltimore schools where art classes have been cut. He wants art to be a kind of therapy for kids to help them deal with hard times.\n\nFrom the time he was young, Maybin said he would be an NFL player and a professional artist, and he has been true to his word.'"

            "text": "\tThe fourth-graders on the Edina, Minnesota, competitive traveling basketball team used a full-court press. They overwhelmed their opponents, and the aggressive strategy helped them to win easily - 27-8.\n\nAfter the game was over, coach Paul Schmidt quickly gathered the 9- and 10-year-old players around him to look ahead to the next game, which was starting soon.\n\n\"When we go in the 'Diamond' down low, it's an inverted 'Diamond' that we're running, which is not what we really want,\" he said. \"You guys know what 'inverted' means?\"\n\nThe coach was talking about the shape the players make while moving down the court.\n\nThese fourth-graders are getting a taste of the serious competition of youth sports - the intense activity that many love and others despise.\n\n## Explosion Of Teams\n\nYouth hockey in Minnesota is famously competitive, but now youth basketball may be catching up.\n\nMore and more boys and girls are signing up to play ultra-competitive basketball at younger ages. Teams with third-graders - even second-graders - are popping up.\n\nTen years ago, the Minnesota Youth Athletic Services (MYAS) began hosting a state tournament for boys' fourth-grade traveling teams and 20 teams took part. Last year, 115 teams competed.\n\n\"I won't say it's hockey-like, but it's close,\" Todd Breyfogle said, shaking his head. \"Too many parents over here think their kid is going be the next Minnesota Gopher.\"\n\nBreyfogle is a former college basketball player, but he was reluctant at first to sign up his son, Easton, to play on Edina's team. Still, he did sign him up, and before long, Breyfogle was sitting court-side, yelling to the team, \"Come on, drive it!\"\n\n## On The Road Again\n\nEdina's traveling team is part of a larger trend in Minnesota - more teams playing fourth-grade travel basketball. The competitive sport asks the players to travel to compete against other teams.\n\n\"We were one of just a handful\" that had not yet lowered the age, said Paul Manley, Edina's boys' travel director. We realized that \"we need to do that otherwise we're going to be behind.\"\n\nAt the Cake Eater Classic - Edina's boys' basketball tournament for fourth- to eighth-graders - 234 teams competed from across Minnesota.\n\nSchmidt's team, which is the highest-rated of Edina's three squads, will play at least 40 games this winter. The fee to join one of the teams is $500, if you make the squad. Back in the fall, 44 fourth-graders tried out and 15 were cut, thanks in part to the opinions of outside evaluators brought in to judge the players.\n\nSchmidt's team got off to a slow start. It had a 4-9 record early in January, but by later in the month, the team was winning regularly.\n\n\"It's just really fun, especially if you're on a really good team,\" Schmidt's 10-year-old son, Lleyton, said between games at a weekend tournament. Was he tired? \"Like, sort of,\" he replied.\n\n## Parents Are Pushing For Younger Teams\n\nIt's not the kids, like Lleyton, who are creating demand for competitive basketball at a young age, said Rich Penick, director at MYAS, but \"it's the parents that are driving it.\"\n\nPenick said MYAS only added a fourth-grade state tournament because so many youth basketball groups wanted it. The groups had \"so many parents pushing it,\" he said.\n\nDeborah Edwards, the executive director of the Positive Coaching Alliance in Minnesota, said she shakes her head over what is happening. \"Youth sports is so scheduled - it's over-scheduled. I think these traveling basketball teams just add to the over-scheduling of the kids.\"\n\nBoth parents and young players can be surprised by the commitments of youth basketball. There are huge time commitments, travel, expenses. Some of the players, just 9 years old, may not be ready for the tough realities of competitive sports - like getting cut from a team, said Derek Sharrer of the East Ridge Athletic Association.\n\n\"We try to limit (cuts from the team) as much as possible. (We) focus less on it being a 'cut,' and more on it being a transition to playing at a lower level,\" he said.\n\n## A Scholarship Down The Road?\n\nIn Edina, the passionate parents have different ways of supporting their young athletes.\n\nGiovanna Ingram is paying $75 an hour to have her son, Vinnie, get extra training from a former professional basketball player. She jokingly called herself an \"over-the-top\" parent.\n\nShe pointed to her son as he practiced on the court. \"He is number 23 - Michael Jordan,\" she said. She was also direct about her goals for her son.\n\n\"An athletic scholarship would be nice,\" she said, Division I or II ideally, referring to the top levels of college sports.\n\nBut she quickly added: \"The end all is to keep him out of trouble, (keep) him healthy - maybe get a scholarship in the end.\"\n\nAnother parent, Mike Munson, sits on the bench with a tablet and uses an app to track and analyze the team's shots.\n\n\"It shows shot selection, where we make shots, where we don't,\" he said. He emails the results to an assistant coach after each game and \"it's something they can use when they have practice.\" His son, 9-year-old Tyler, wears number 3. \"He loves it,\" Munson said. \"I ask him, (after) every practice or game, is he having fun? He always says he has a blast.\"\n\n## Taking A Toll\n\nFor parents, there are heavy commitments - financial and emotional. Doug Lundahl, whose son, Jake, wears number 21, talked of paying $110 for basketball shoes, $125 for a uniform and $120 for an Under Armour gym bag with Jake's name on it.\n\nAnd then there is the stress of the games themselves. \"They've had so many close games,\" Lundahl said, standing and watching a practice. \"As a parent, you age real fast.\"\n\nTwice in the previous two years, the police have been called to Edina's Cake Eater Classic to calm down rowdy parents. At one point, in a fifth-grade finals game, one team refused to take the court until police arrived to keep an eye on the crowd of parents.'"

            "text": "\tBOSTON, Mass. - Harvard University's debate team lost to a group of New York prisoners.\n\nThe showdown took place at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility. Inmates, or people who have been convicted of crimes, live at this maximum-security prison. They can take college courses, and even earn college degrees from nearby Bard College. Professors from Bard teach the classes. The inmates have formed a popular debate club. Last month, the Correctional Facility invited the Harvard students over for a friendly contest.\n\nThe Harvard debate team was named this year's national debate champion. The team was also crowned world champion in 2014.\n\nThe inmates' debate team is also building a great reputation. In the two years since they started a debate club, the prisoners have already beaten teams from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York and the University of Vermont. The annual contest with West Point has grown into a big deal.\n\n## Education Behind Bars\n\nAt Bard, those who help teach the inmates aren't particularly surprised by their success.\n\nStudents in the prison are held to the exact same standards as students at Bard College, said Max Kenner. He runs the Bard Prison Initiative, a program that helps educate men and women in prison.\n\n\"Those students are serious,\" he said.\n\nThe professors do not look down on these students, Kenner pointed out.\n\n## Harvard Caught Off Guard\n\nAgainst Harvard, the inmates were asked to defend a position they opposed. They had to argue that public schools should be allowed to turn away students whose parents entered the United States illegally. The inmates brought up arguments that surprised the Harvard team.\n\nThree students from Harvard's team responded by arguing that U.S. public schools should admit these students.\n\nA panel of judges declared the inmates winners.\n\n\"The fact that we won is nice, but it isn't the most important thing,\" said Kenner, adding that the club is meant to help students express what they've learned.\n\n## Losers Like It On Facebook\n\nShortly after the loss, students on the Harvard team posted a comment to their team's Facebook page.\n\n\"There are few teams we are prouder of having lost a debate to than the phenomenally intelligent and articulate team we faced this weekend,\" they wrote. \"And we are incredibly thankful to Bard and the Eastern New York Correctional Facility for the work they do and for organizing this event.\"\n\n## Inmates And The Ivy League\n\nInmates can earn various college degrees through the Bard program. About 15 percent of the all-male inmates at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility take the classes.\n\nGraduates of the program have even continued their studies at Yale and Columbia universities, Kenner said. Like Harvard, Yale and Columbia are part of the Ivy League - a group of eight private colleges and universities on the U.S. East Coast that are known for their academic excellence and history. Seven of these eight schools were founded before the American Revolution in 1776.\n\nWhile in prison, the New York inmates learn without the help of the Internet. Instead, they rely on books provided by the college.\n\n\"They make the most of every opportunity they have,\" Kenner said.'"

            "title": "Schools try to stop serious sports injuries like heat stroke, concussions",
            "text": "\tATHENS, Ga. - The \"no-pain, no-gain\" way of thinking about kids' sports is beginning to take second place to safety.\n\nMore and more, schools are setting rules to keep student athletes safe. The rules make kids stop playing when it's too hot or they are hurt. The goal is to protect kids from the serious injuries that can come from pushing kids to their limits - or beyond.\n\nSince 2009, every state has required that kids be taken off the field if they hit their head. A type of brain injury called a concussion can occur when someone gets hit in the head.\n\nIn addition, some states require schools to have medical devices that restart the heart, as heart attacks are a leading cause of death in young athletes. Also, in the South a number of states have strict rules to avoid heat-related illnesses. And some schools are trying to prevent what are called overuse injuries. They are caused by repeating the same motion over and over, such as pitching a baseball or softball.\n\n## More Schools Need Trainers\n\n\"Without question, all of these policies on heat, concussion, and so forth, they all make sense,\" said Doug Casa. He is with the Korey Stringer Institute at the University of Connecticut. The Stringer Institute studies ways to keep student athletes safe. \"The most important thing you can do is have an athletic trainer on staff.\"\n\nOnly four of every 10 public high schools have a full-time athletic trainer, says the institute.\n\nThe Stringer Institute was named for Minnesota Vikings football player Korey Stringer. He died of heat stroke in 2001. Heat stroke is caused when someone is out in the sun too long. Stringer's death brought attention to the issue of heat-related illnesses in athletes.\n\nIn 2011, Ralph Sweargin was the head of the Georgia High School Association (GHSA). He knew that Georgia had particularly high heat-related illnesses. Between 1980 and 2011, eight high school football players in Georgia died from the heat. At the time in Georgia, schools were starting the year earlier and earlier, which meant football practices begin in mid-July, the hottest days of summer.\n\n## More Breaks If It's Hot\n\nSweargin realized that schools in the state had to follow the same rules to keep kids safe. He also knew schools did not have enough information about what these rules should be. They were \"relying on best guesses\" and \"copying what other people were doing.\"\n\nSweargin asked scientists to study how heat affects high school football players.\n\nThey found that players were especially at risk for heat-related illnesses in the first days of practice. Bud Cooper was one of the scientists. He found that it's important for players to slowly get used to the hot weather.\n\nCooper said that using the heat index to determine heat rules was not enough. The heat index just measures air temperature and humidity. It reflects how hot people actually feel. Yet it ignores \"radiant temperature,\" the temperature on the ground. Certain surfaces, like concrete or a football field, store up heat, making the heat more intense.\n\nThe GHSA told all high schools to use a special calculator. It measures temperature, humidity and radiant temperature. For a reading above 82, teams must take frequent breaks. Higher readings mean shorter practices, and players must wear shorts, not long pants. For readings above 92, outdoor practices are stopped.\n\n## Parents And Coaches Must Change\n\nSchools in the North also need statewide heat rules, Cooper said. Temperatures in the North are high when football season begins. When Stringer died of heat stroke, the heat index hit 110.\n\nHead injuries and extreme heat have drawn the most attention in high school sports. However, they are not the only dangers to young athletes.\n\nOveruse injuries also are receiving more attention. The increasing number of student athletes playing sports year round is causing more injuries. For pitchers, there are elbow and shoulder injuries. In soccer, players get knee injuries. In volleyball and swimming, it's often the shoulder.\n\nMany schools are limiting the number of pitches baseball and softball pitchers are allowed to throw. Some schools force teams to stop training for a while. This gives athletes time to recover. Many parents and coaches, though, are pushing kids to be \"better, faster and stronger,\" said Jeffrey Dugas. He is a sports doctor in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nMark Hyman is a sports reporter. He wrote a book about the increase in youth sports injuries. As more adults have become involved in youth sports, more kids have become injured. Before, when kids got hurt, they stopped playing, Hyman said. Now, \"parents and coaches have been the ones to push them beyond physical limits.\"\n\nFor sports injuries to decrease, parents and coaches have to change, he said.'"

            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia -Julia Lipnitskaia stepped onto the Olympic ice Sunday in red. The 15-year-old, 5-foot-2 Russian figure skater captured the eye as she skated to music from the film \"Schindler's List.\" She leaped out from her competition with overwhelming artistry, flexibility and blurring spins.\n\nWhen the music stopped, and she had landed the last of her 10 jumps, a mesmerized crowd was on its feet applauding. The crowd, which included Russian President Vladimir Putin, whistled and chanted, 'Yu-li-a! Yu-li-a!' and \"Russ-ee-ya! Russ-ee-ya!''\n\nThe Sochi Olympics had found its ice princess.\n\nLipnitskaia had already announced her arrival with a spellbinding short program in the opening team competition Saturday night. But now the new girl from Russia's Ural Mountains had won the team gold medal for Russia.\n\n## Russia's First Gold Medal\n\nThe team figure skating competition adds up scores from one female skater, one male skater, a pair of skaters and an ice dancing team. Ten countries compete against each other.\n\nThe team gold medal was the host nation's first gold of these Games, and Lipnitskaia became the youngest athlete ever to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics.\n\nShe is six days younger than Tara Lipinski, another figure skater with a similar last name who also won gold at an early age. Lipinski is an American skater who won at 15 in Nagano, Japan, in 1998.\n\nCanada won the team silver on Sunday. The United States took bronze with an upbeat, flawless first-place performance from ice dancers Charlie White and Meryl Davis. Another teenager, 18-year-old Gracie Gold, performed an elegant Sleeping Beauty routine.\n\nLipnitskaia posted the highest women's score in the short and long program over the past three days. She firmly established herself as a gold medal contender in next week's women's singles event. Despite Russia's long tradition in winning pairs, ice dancing and men's skating, no Russian woman has ever won in singles.\n\nThis time, it looks like the Russian team is loaded in all fields. In the team event, Lipnitskaia and the Russian pairs team won.\n\n## Skates After Rusasia's Plushenko\n\nThree-time Olympic medalist and 2006 champion Evgeni Plushenko brought the house down on Sunday after recovering from a hurt back earlier this year. Known for his soaring jumps, power, and his charisma, the 31-year-old had the crowd in the palm of his hand.\n\nThey roared when he landed his quadruple toe jump, and went nuts when he lifted his finger to his lips to quiet them down during his performance. He was a controversial pick to the Olympic team because of his injury troubles last year. But he proved he can still jump - though he was limping a bit afterward and said his back was not 100 percent.\n\n\"I skated for my kids, my wife, and my country,'' he said.\n\nHis coach, Alexei Mishin, said: \"Evgeni has charisma and power. Maybe somebody does not like him, but the majority loves him and respects him. The minority is jealous.''\n\nLipnitskaia admitted she was apprehensive about skating after Plushenko. His adoring fans showered him with so many flower bouquets and stuffed animals that it took 12 young skaters to shuffle around the ice and pick them up.\n\n\"I was a bit nervous skating after Evgeni because I didn't want to let the team down,'' she said. \"He was very happy for me at the end and congratulated me in the kiss and cry (area). My main motivation today was not to let the team down.\"\n\n## \"A Young Genius\"\n\nShe had a hard time articulating how it felt to skate so well on the world's biggest stage.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain the feeling I had out there,'' she said. \"I'm very happy to have helped win the first gold medal for Russia. I got nervous in the middle of the program, I'm not sure why, it's completely unlike me, so the jumps weren't great in the second half, I didn't feel totally comfortable. The jumps didn't feel like mine at that point. I wouldn't say I got tired, but some errors still crept in. But even with some flaws it was OK.''\n\nOther skaters, Russian and non-Russian, gushed over the young talent.\n\n\"A young genius,'' said Russian ice dancer Ekaterina Bobrova.\n\n\"She was incredibly composed,'' said U.S. skater Ashley Wagner. \"You felt the audience when she stepped out on the ice, so for her to go out and put out such a solid performance at 15 is impressive. Granted, we've been backstage with her and she doesn't seem 15 to us at all. She's like a wise 40-year-old woman trapped within a 15-year-old's body. Honestly, it is very inspiring to see someone so young so composed.''\n\nGold added: \"She's only 15. She's completely unfazed. She's got no spine, but she's got iron in her bones.\"\n\nLipnitskaia will travel to Moscow on Monday and begin training Tuesday for the women's singles competition. The U.S. skaters are also planning to leave Sochi and train in several undisclosed European locations.\n\nSkating competition continues Tuesday with the pairs short program. The men begin on Thursday and the women Feb. 19.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Soccer player Steven Beitashour wants to make a couple of things clear right away.\n\nFirst of all, his decision to play for [Iran's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) national team in this summer's World Cup had nothing to do with politics.\n\n\"I just thought about soccer,\" Beitashour says. \"It's a great opportunity, especially to play on the international stage.\"\n\nAnd secondly, he does not want to be compared to a soldier who would go fight for any country willing to pay him. If U.S. Soccer had wanted him as much as Iran's national team, he would have been just as happy to stay home. But he was never asked to make that choice.\n\nFor Beitashour, who was born in San Jose, Calif., to Iranian parents, the decision to play for Iran has been solely about soccer. But for many others, his choice seems to be tinged with politics. After all, the U.S. and Iran have had a very strained relationship for more than 30 years.\n\n## \"The Biggest Stage\"\n\n\"When we hear of an Iranian-American going back and contributing somehow to where our parents grew up, it's an awesome feeling,\" says Borhan Oskoorouchi of San Jose, who runs a weekly Farsi/Persian-language radio program.\n\nMeanwhile, Beitashour just wants to play in a World Cup. For the 27-year-old, this summer's tournament in [Brazil](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Brazil) could be his last chance. The World Cup happens once every four years.\n\n\"It's the biggest stage and the best players (are) playing there,\" says Beitashour, a former Major League Soccer (MLS) all-star who plays right back for the Vancouver Whitecaps. \"Having an opportunity to potentially be there, it's just great.\"\n\nHe's not there yet. Beitashour first played for Iran in an Asian Cup qualifier last October. The team still has three friendly matches left before its final World Cup roster is due next month showing who will play. Beitashour is hardly guaranteed a spot.\n\nBut his U.S. background and his experience on a professional soccer team might help. Iran's Portuguese manager, Carlos Queiroz, conducts his practices in English and has an MLS background.\n\nQueiroz was also responsible for bringing Beitashour into the Iranian program. After he took over the national team three years ago, he put together a list of several players with Iranian backgrounds who were playing all over the world.\n\n## Of Two Cultures\n\n\"At the beginning there was a little bit of resistance,\" says former assistant coach Omid Namazi. \"But once that ice broke and players came in and showed what they could bring to the national team, I think it was a sense of welcome.\"\n\nIt certainly was for Beitashour.\n\n\"Within five, 10 minutes I felt like they were my brothers,\" he says of his Iranian teammates.\n\nBeitashour still struggles with the language, Farsi. Before getting an invitation to join the team, he hadn't visited the country since he was 5. But while he was growing up in California's Silicon Valley, his parents observed many Iranian traditions.\n\n\"The culture is still part of you,\" he says. \"I definitely feel like I've got strong ties.\"\n\nStill, his upbringing was also as American as apple pie and weekend visits to the mall.\n\nBeitashour went on to the play at San Diego State, then spent four years with the San Jose Earthquakes of MLS before being sold to Vancouver in January.\n\n## The Next Hurdle\n\nSo even though Iranian coaches first contacted him three years ago and asked him to begin the lengthy process of preparing the paperwork necessary to visit the country, playing for them wasn't part of the plan. He had been called into the U.S. national team camp in the summer of 2012 and again the following January.\n\nBut Beitashour didn't get into a game either time, and officials with U.S. Soccer said it was unlikely he'd ever play for the team.\n\nSo when Iran called back, he jumped at the chance to play in a World Cup. U.S. Coach Juergen Klinsmann blessed the decision.\n\n\"In our ranking in the right back position, he was five, six, seven. So it was not realistic,\" says Klinsmann, who played in three World Cups for Germany. \"I don't want them to miss out on anything. If this is what they badly want, then absolutely fine.\"\n\nThe next hurdle for Beitashour is being chosen to join the team.\n\n\"It's going to go down to the wire,\" says Namazi, the former assistant coach. \"But I have a good feeling that he\\xc2\\xb4ll be on the squad come the World Cup.\"'"

Yet her powerful playing sent her and her high school teammates to four playoffs in a row.\n\nAlso, Saiki, age 18, has earned a basketball scholarship to West Virginia University.\n\nFor all this, she can thank the skills she learned in a Japanese-American basketball league.\n\n\"That helped build my foundation,\" Saiki said. \"I really fell in love with basketball.\"\n\nThe Asian leagues have been the starting point for many successful high school and college players. It has been especially important for young women.\n\n## They May Be Short But They Play Tall\n\nKeppel is a strong team, even though the average height of its players is usually less than 5-foot-5. All but one of the girls on the school's team last season played in a Japanese-American basketball league. Three of Saiki's teammates have played basketball with her since they were 5.\n\nThere are several thousand youth and adult players in Asian leagues in California. There are bowling, baseball, volleyball leagues, but none of them are as popular as basketball.\n\nTeams come from a variety of organizations, including clubs, Buddhist temples and community centers. In fact, there are so many young players that a few Japanese-American churches in Los Angeles canceled Sunday school classes.\n\n\"Right now, it seems like basketball is the only thing that holds the community together,\" said George Imamura. He used to be the president of the South Bay F.O.R. Junior Sports Association, the largest Japanese-American basketball organization in Southern California. \"That's why I think it's so important that if that's all we have right now, to keep it going.\"\n\n## A Long Line Of Tiger Athletes\n\nOn a Sunday morning in the spring, Claire Sugiyama was in the Alhambra High School gym bleachers. She sat with about a dozen parents and grandparents to watch her daughter, Sarah, play with the Tigerettes Pulelehua sixth-grade team.\n\nSarah comes from a long line of Tigers. Her grandfather was a founder of the Tigers Youth Club, and her father, who coaches the team, also played basketball with the organization.\n\n\"He just felt she needed to play with Tigers,\" Claire Sugiyama said. \"She was born with stripes.\"\n\nThe Japanese American Optimist Club girls' league began about 50 years ago. It gave children of Japanese-American families the opportunity to play basketball at a time when they were not allowed to play elsewhere, said Leland Lau, league commissioner. When he became the head of the league about 20 years ago, there were about 50 girls' teams. Today, there are nearly 130.\n\nThe leagues' success in getting girls onto high school teams has even attracted non-Asian players, Lau said.\n\n## Stiff Competition But Great Rewards\n\nCompetition on the Japanese-American teams can be fierce, said Kiki Yang. She is a star player at Pasadena's Polytechnic School and three-time winner of the league's most-valuable-player award.\n\n\"It gave me more confidence,\" she said. \"It exposes you to the sport and allows you to make friends from different schools.\"\n\nKayla Sato, 17, said the skills she learned in Japanese-American basketball have been important.\n\n\"This community is like a family,\" Sato said. \"Through one connection, there were so many doors.\"\n\nBasketball is a sport that generally attracts tall players. However, the lack of height has not been an obstacle for the Japanese-American girls, Lau said.\n\nConfidence is key, said Monica Hang. She played in the leagues and is now coach of the Los Angeles Valley College women's basketball team.\n\n\"It taught me how to be 5-foot-2 and play as if I was 6-foot-2,\" she said.\n\n## Good Foundation For The Future\n\nThat confidence will be important for Saiki as she heads 2,500 miles away to West Virginia.\n\n\"I'm nervous because it's big-time basketball, but I'm pretty excited because it's a great experience,\" she said. \"I'm going to meet a lot of different people and have different experiences than what I've had growing up on the West Coast.\"\n\nFirst she'll have to graduate from high school and say goodbye to her teammates. They grew up together.\n\n\"It's going to be a bittersweet moment, of course,\" Saiki said. \"I'll probably stay in touch with them a lot.\"'"

            "text": "\tPeople who ask me about bullying are often surprised when I tell them that I have been singled out for my race on the basketball court. \n\nGrowing up, it wasn't very common for an Asian-American to be spending as much time as I did on basketball. On many of the teams I played for, I was either the only or one of very few Asian-Americans. This made me an easy target for opponents. Unfortunately, I was often mocked.\n\nIn middle school, some of the players on opposing league teams called me a \"Chinese import\" or told me to \"go back to China.\" When I started playing basketball at Harvard University it became even more open. During some of our games, people would openly call me hurtful racial insults or even ask me if I could see the scoreboard with my eyes. They made fun of me by chanting Asian foods like \"shrimp fried rice.\" \n\n## Blatant Racism Was Shocking\n\nI was shocked that people could be so glaringly racist in a college environment. And I felt furious that they would use my race, something I was proud of, to try to embarrass or hurt me. During one game, the comments got to me so much that I began to play in a rage. In my anger I started playing badly in an important game.\n\nMy assistant coach at the time was Kenny Blakeney. He could see what had happened and pulled me aside after the game. He told me that when people use racial insults, they're trying to get under my skin and mess with my mind. When I become angry and lose control, they have succeeded. \n\nHe told me about his own experience of being bullied because he was African-American. People threw things at him while he was eating a meal or called him horrible racist names. I was shocked at what he had gone through. He told me that I could let the bullying get to me, or I could use it to become a better basketball player and a better human being. \n\n## A Coach's Encouragement\n\nHearing about how he had overcome bullying in his own life gave me hope and encouragement. Instead of letting his experience make him angry and bitter, my coach used it make him stronger. Maybe I couldn't control what people said to me, but I could choose how I felt about myself.\n\nWhen people bully, they are trying to raise themselves up by pushing someone else down. To do that, they may try to find something that is different about you to use against you. But your differences are what make you special. When you get bullied, you may be tempted to want to just blend in with everyone else. \n\nBut don't do it. Hold on to what makes you unique and embrace it. It might be what makes you an artist or a scientist some day. It could help you be a role model to others who feel the same way you do. You'd be surprised how many people you admire now were once bullied for being different.\n\n## Stand Up For Others\n\nIf you aren't being bullied right now, stand up for people who might be singled out because they don't look or act like everyone else. Speak up for them. Likewise, help them find someone who they can talk to. My coach made me feel less alone and helped me remember not to let it get to me. No matter how old you are, you can help people feel safe to be themselves.\n\nAfter years of bullying, I am extremely proud to be an Asian-American in the NBA. If I had let the name-calling get to me, I wouldn't be able to go to my dream job every day with the Charlotte Hornets. If Coach Blakeney hadn't taken me aside and encouraged me, I might have continued to lose my temper or given up. \n\nNow, I'm grateful to represent my culture and do what I love. I love teaching my teammates Chinese phrases and to introduce them to my Asian culture. Most of all, I love using what makes me different to encourage young people to be proud of their own differences.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES, Calif. - After a lifetime in basketball, Kobe Bryant announced Sunday that he will retire after this season. Bryant kept his vow that he would never play for another team and ends a 20-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\"I had to just accept the fact that I don't want to do this anymore, and I'm OK with that,\" Bryant said.\n\nBryant made the long-expected announcement in a poem titled \"Dear Basketball,\" posted Sunday on The Players' Tribune.\n\n\"My heart can take the pounding. My mind can handle the grind. But my body knows it's time to say goodbye,\" wrote Bryant, who is the third-highest scorer in NBA history. \"And that's OK. I'm ready to let you go. I want you to know now. So we both can savor every moment we have left together. The good and the bad. We have given each other all that we have.\"\n\n## An NBA All-Star 17 Times\n\nAt the Lakers game against the Indiana Pacers Sunday, fans received a letter from Bryant in a black and gold envelope.\n\n\"What you've done for me is far greater than anything I've done for you,\" wrote Bryant in the letter. \"I knew that each minute of each game I wore purple and gold,\" the team colors.\n\nBryant's announcement fit his dramatic career. He has played in five NBA championships and was named an NBA All-Star a total of 17 times. No other NBA player has has spent longer on a single team than Bryant.\n\nIn 1996, Bryant joined his favorite team straight from high school in suburban Philadelphia. He made the highest score in Lakers history and inspired a generation of fans and players. Only 13 players in NBA history have played on more championship teams than Bryant.\n\n\"Kobe was my Jordan,\" said Paul George, an Indiana Pacers player, who was referring to basketball superstar Michael Jordan. \"Watching him win championships when I was growing up, that's who I idolized. That was the standard.\"\n\n## \"Very Solid In My Decision\"\n\nBryant's last three seasons ended early because of injuries, and in the last two years, he played only 41 games. In the first 16 games of this season, he made just one of every three of his shots, and he has dealt with pain and exhaustion every day.\n\nBryant said that he does not have a burning desire to continue playing basketball. \"I feel very solid in my decision,\" he said.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said that \"Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest players in the history of our game.\"\n\nBefore Sunday's game, as Bryant warmed up, more people than usual took cellphone pictures of him. Bryant then missed his first six shots. He made two important shots later in the game.\n\nNeither Bryant nor the Lakers are doing well this season, but he intends to keep going.\n\n\"There's nothing I would love more than to be able to play this entire season,\" he said. Bryant added that he would like to play on all the basketball league's courts one last time.\n\n## He's The Highest-Paid Player\n\nBryant earns $25 million and is the NBA's highest-paid player this season.\n\nLakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak said the team is not playing well enough to challenge Bryant. \"So I'm not surprised that he would make the announcement now,\" Kupchak said. \"I think the game will be easier for him now. I think he'll be able to enjoy the rest of the season.\"\n\nIn his first public comments since his decision, Bryant said his decision has given him peace of mind. He did not say much about his plans for the future, although he said it would be an \"an honor\" if he is picked for the U.S. Olympic team this summer.\n\n\"Honestly, when I'm sitting in meditation, my mind starts drifting, and it always drifted toward basketball, always.\" Bryant added that he does not think about basketball all the time now, which make him think that it is time to move on to other things.'"

He has 70 seconds to memorize the order.\n\nZupp then sets a timer and grabs another deck. He is about to see how fast he can replicate the order of the shuffled cards.\n\nHis fastest time so far is 65 seconds.\n\n\"I don't do anything bizarre,\" said Zupp, who performs this drill at least 10 times a day.\n\nBut what's normal to Zupp and other competitors in the Memory Championship can seem strange to others. Many of us forget to buy milk at the store or forget people's names when we first meet them.\n\nMemory competitors don't.\n\n## Eight Tense Hours\n\nOn a rainy Saturday in March, 65 of them gathered in a Manhattan office tower for the 17th USA Memory Championship. The competition is one of several contests held each year around the world. It went on for nearly eight tense hours. Competitors scrambled to rearrange playing cards, match names with faces of strangers, and remember random numbers. They had to memorize a 25-line poem and write it down word for word.\n\nThere were dentists, students, nurses, teachers, writers and magicians, ranging in age from 16 to 50. They seemed to have little in common beyond their love for memorization and their difficult training methods, which usually involve sitting in isolation for several hours a day practicing.\n\nMost give visual images to just about everything. Then they create places in their minds to store those pictures, which serve as memory triggers.\n\nSue Jin Yang, a nurse in San Francisco, calls it the cookie crumb method.\n\n\"I imagine that I am walking a pathway ... stopping at distinct locations, dropping off 'cookie crumbs' of visual images,\" said Yang, 32, who was competing in New York for the third time.\n\nWhen Yang needs to recall something, she envisions walking the path, which she models after a familiar place. In her mind, she stops at particular locations to pick up the correct cookie crumbs.\n\n## 31 Is Matt Damon\n\nYang's system associates numbers with sounds and letters. That nudges Yang to remember her chosen images, which tend toward famous faces. For example, three is associated with \"m,\" one with \"d.\"\n\n\"So when I am given a digit such as 31, I see actor Matt Damon,\" Yang said. \"Sixty-two is Sean Penn.\"\n\nImages, when tied together, can lead to fantasy-like pictures.\n\nLance Tschirhart, 25, a competitor from Texas, explained how the number 141251213 is embedded in his memory: 141 brings to mind a dart; 251 is an electrical outlet; 213 is a nutmeg.\n\n\"So I can imagine throwing a dart into an outlet and sparks shooting out around a nutmeg,\" Tschirhart said during a break between drills in the competition.\n\n## A Long Line Of Champions\n\nThe competitors nodded knowingly. Spectators looked baffled.\n\n\"You have to use your imagination,\" Tschirhart said.\n\nThe first New York contest, in 1997, drew 18 players. The winner was Tatiana Cooley, a secretary who joined the competition minutes before it began. Last year, Ram Kolli, a businessman from Los Angeles, beat the reigning champion, mountaineer Nelson Dellis, who had won the previous two years.\n\nOther winners have included Ron White and Scott Hagwood. White is a war veteran who has won twice, and memorized the name and rank of every U.S. service member killed in Afghanistan. Scott Hagwood competed after doctors warned that the radiation treatment he had for his cancer could hurt his memory.\n\nHagwood won four years straight from 2001 to 2004.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - On a soggy field in Granada Hills, eight units stand at attention, ready to salute the American flag as it rises toward a cloudy morning sky.\n\nThe bugler lifts the brass instrument to his mouth and waits. A short delay gives away the deception. Then a recording of \"Reveille\" blasts out from stereo speakers as the flag moves up the pole.\n\nThe call finishes, and the 17-year-old lowers his bugle.\n\n\"I'm taking lessons,\" Jesiah Samora says. \"I'll be able to actually play it soon.\"\n\nThen the bleary-eyed middle and high school classmates march, mostly in step, toward their homerooms.\n\n## A Military Transformation\n\nThey are the first students at North Valley Military Institute, a Los Angeles Unified School District charter school. A charter school is a public school operated by a private company. This year, North Valley was transformed from a traditional school to one loaded with military values and structure.\n\nThe change came about because enrollment at the school known as North Valley Charter Academy began falling. Principal Diane French and other administrators sought a way to boost the number of students. But they still had to accomplish the school's mission - educational excellence, democratic leadership and personal growth.\n\nFrench visited the Oakland Military Institute, a charter started in 2001 by then-Mayor Jerry Brown. Impressed, she sought to replicate the program, which boasts a 95 percent college attendance rate for its graduates.\n\nIn its first year, North Valley Military Institute has enrolled 260 students, up from about 190 last year. Latino students make up about 80 percent of the attendees, 82 percent of the school's students are low-income and about 25 percent are special-education students.\n\nThe military part of the school is overseen by the California Cadet Corps, the youth program of the California National Guard. Students enter the school as pledges. They rise in rank as they master skills and develop leadership traits, said Steve Diab, California Cadet Corps captain. Diab is also the school's commandant.\n\nStudents are taught military courtesies. They use \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" when addressing their elders, for instance. They operate under a rank structure and wear uniforms. Students lead units of their peers, do physical training twice a week and follow a demerit system that penalizes them for violations.\n\n## \"I Can Feel The Burn ... Sir!\"\n\n\"We're using the military structure to get kids to go to college,\" French said. \"It teaches them self-reliance, self-discipline, leadership - all attributes needed for success in college.\"\n\nL.A. Unified's charter school division initially had some concerns about the program. Among them were that students needed to be able to work off disciplinary demerits. The school also had to be open to all students who wished to attend, said Jose Cole-Gutierrez, the division head.\n\nNorth Valley officials agreed to those conditions.\n\nEach morning, four students - one representing each company: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta - stand watch over the front entrance of the school.\n\nThey eye the students, searching for flaws in uniforms and looking for short hair on the boys and tightly pinned-back hair on the girls. Colored nail polish is prohibited, but makeup is allowed in moderation. Any violation is a demerit. Each demerit lands a student 15 minutes of detention, which the school calls a \"reboot.\"\n\nThe demerit system is strict but geared toward conversation, French said. \"It's a valuable way of tracking the kind of behaviors for which we need to intervene and talk to the student about,\" she said.\n\nOn a recent warm afternoon, a class of high school students headed out to the field for physical training, where they did dozens of push-ups and jumping jacks.\n\n\"Sit-ups!\" Diab ordered, firmly, as the students hit the deck. After a few minutes, one student jokingly shouted, \"I can feel the burn ... sir!\"\n\nThe military influence has led to some confusion in the surrounding neighborhood. Some parents believe the school is a boot camp for troubled teens or is run by the military.\n\n## Learning Leadership And Responsibility\n\nBut there are no recruiters on campus, and the focus is college preparation, officials said.\n\nChristian Rubalcava, 17, said that despite rising to the top student leadership position at the school, battalion commander, he has no plans to join the service. Christian has attended the school since sixth grade, and when it began converting to a military-style campus, he decided to help with the change. The program has taught him leadership and responsibility, he said.\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for the service,\" he said, adjusting his red beret. \"But I still don't want to join. I want to go to USC. That's the whole mission of the school, to get us to go to college.\"\n\nBut North Valley has sparked the interest of some students in a military career.\n\nLast year, junior Mireya Orozco said, she would ditch class nearly every day to drink and get high. Her grades were falling and she figured she'd soon drop out, and the change to the military school made her even less interested in school. \"It was so annoying,\" she said. \"I didn't want to do any of the military stuff.\"\n\nBut slowly, Mireya said, she fell in line. Her mother noticed she was more polite at home, her grades got better and she ditched the bad behavior. She now wants to enlist in the Navy after graduating. \"I like the discipline of it,\" Mireya said. \"It has taught me self-control.\"\n\nAt the end of each day, the students return to their formation on the field to lower the flag. Jesiah raises his bugle once again as a recording plays.\n\nFor most, this marks the end of the school day. But for some - those who have fallen behind on classwork - the day continues. They march, mostly in step, to after-school tutoring.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - When the Chicago Blackhawks take the ice, Michelle Secor is dressed in her team clothing, watching every play, every goal.\n\n\"I have to cheer for our home teams,\" Secor said as she took a break from watching the Stanley Cup finals last week. \"Bulls. Sox. Bears. Hawks. I was born into this.\"\n\nSecor, who is of Mexican descent, is one of a small but growing number of minorities who have become hooked on hockey. She just started watching in recent years, but she is devoted to the sport.\n\n\"It makes us all feel good to see a Chicago team out there winning - race doesn't matter,\" she said.\n\n## Fans Of Different Backgrounds\n\nHockey for years has been watched and played primarily by whites, experts said. That is partly because of its Canadian roots. But the National Hockey League said that is slowly changing. There have been more minorities on NHL rosters in recent years than in the decades before. The number peaked at 50 in 2009. The percentage of fans who are minorities is up, though slightly, too, the league said.\n\nThe Blackhawks have three black players, the most of any NHL team.\n\nThe NHL counts 58 million U.S. fans. Of that, 9.4 percent are Latino, while about 8.3 percent of U.S. hockey fans are African-American. The percentage of black fans has been stable since 2010. But the number of African-American fans has increased because the total number of overall fans has increased, a league spokeswoman said.\n\n\"We are gaining more fans, and we are gaining more fans of different backgrounds,\" she said.\n\nThe NHL doesn't target specific ethnic groups with its programs, said Ken Martin, the Vice President of Community Affairs and Fan Development. But the league has tried to reach out to youth in urban communities.\n\n## Winning Wins More Fans Too\n\nThe league is getting exposure in new Chicago neighborhoods by other means, too. \"One way is by the Blackhawks winning,\" Martin said. \"The Blackhawks have been a leader in making our game accessible.\"\n\nEven as Blackhawks fever sweeps much of Chicago, the sport remains out of reach for many people of color. There are few opportunities to learn the rules and not a lot of places for minorities to play, said Richard Lapchick of the University of Central Florida. \"The NHL now has programs in cities, but it's a slow building process.\"\n\nPlus, there have not been a lot of big star players who are minorities, Lapchick said.\n\nAccording to the NHL, there are 44 minority players on the rosters of the league's 30 teams. Half of them are black and four are Hispanic. \"Middle-class and upper-class African-Americans have started watching hockey as spectators,\" Lapchick said. \"Once there are some African-American star players in the game, that will help. The value of diversity for the NHL is that it would greatly expand their fan base.\"\n\n## An Expensive Sport To Learn And Play\n\nThe cost of the sport is another hurdle, experts said.\n\n\"The problem with hockey is that it's not a sport you can go in your backyard and play,\" said Jimmy Terracino, director of operations at the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero. \"You've got to have an ice rink. You need skates, you need sticks, helmets, gloves, elbow pads, shin guards. That limits many people from playing or learning it.\"\n\nStill, there are efforts to develop interest in the sport among minorities. For example, there are youth hockey leagues based at Johnny's IceHouse in Chicago that reach out to local minority children so they can learn and play.\n\nIn Cicero, a Chicago suburb where 78 percent of the town's population is of Mexican descent, there is a $3.5 million ice rink. The rink has become popular among the town's Latino children, Terracino said.\n\n\"With the Blackhawks doing good, it gives the sport wider exposure, and gets even more kids interested in hockey,\" Terracino said.\n\nVic Ortiz, who is Mexican-American and lives on the South Side, considers himself a big Chicago sports fan. But for years, he took little interest in the Blackhawks because the games were too expensive and most of the home games were not televised.\n\n\"We couldn't afford to go to the games. The Hawks games weren't on TV like the Bulls. How could you learn about them?\" he said.\n\nBut now, Ortiz tunes in, even when the Blackhawks aren't in the playoffs, he said.\n\n## \"We're Riding With Them\"\n\nGertrude Johnson, who is African-American and lives on the Near North Side, grew up watching the Bears and Bulls, she said. About five years ago, her mother persuaded her to start watching hockey.\n\nAt first, she liked the fights. Then she learned the rules of the game, admiring the speed of the players and the way they stick up for and protect each other.\n\n\"Anybody who is making a name for Chicago, we're riding with them,\" Johnson said.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Four ping-pong balls are proudly displayed in the Los Angeles Clippers' practice gym. The black numbers printed on the balls read 5-3-6-10. That was the winning combination from the 2009 NBA draft lottery.\n\nWinning that lottery did not give the Clippers a big pile of money. It meant they got the first pick of all the newest basketball players coming into the NBA. They chose Blake Griffin, the young star who has helped the Clippers get their team back on track.\n\nNow it's draft season all over again. The NBA's 14 teams will soon find out the order they will use to take turns picking new players in next month's 2015 draft.\n\n## No More Coin Toss\n\nBack in the 1960s, the teams that lost the most games got to pick their new players first. There was just one twist. The worst teams from each conference had a coin toss to see who would get the very first pick.\n\nThen in 1984, Houston started losing games on purpose to give themselves a better chance of getting that year's top pick. To prevent the same thing from happening the following year, the NBA switched over to a lottery system. Officials drew envelopes with the teams' names inside them to determine the draft order.\n\nMany people were frustrated that the new lottery system did not give the lowest-performing teams the best shot at the most talented players. Other people said it was too easy for someone to cheat by making one of the envelopes stand out from the others. The envelope system only lasted a few years.\n\n## Random Number Combinations\n\nThe NBA lottery has since become a more complicated process. The organization now relies on ping-pong balls to keep the draft fair for all 14 teams.\n\nBefore the drawing begins, each team gets a list of number combinations - sort of like bingo cards. To balance things out, the worst teams get the longest list of number combinations. That gives them better chances of winning the first overall pick.\n\nFor example, Minnesota had the NBA's worst record this year, so they will get a list of 250 number combinations. This gives them a 1 in 4 chance of winning the number 1 pick. New York finished next to last, so they will have 199 combinations for a 1 in 5 chance of winning. The chance of winning a top pick goes down for the other teams.\n\n## Next Number Up!\n\nOn lottery night, numbered ping-pong balls spin around in a machine for 20 seconds. Then the balls are drawn out one at a time. Whichever team has the matching number combination wins the top pick.\n\nThe four balls go back into the drum and the process is repeated to determine the selection order for the other teams.\n\nThe ping-pong ball system gives losing teams more chances to improve, but still creates plenty of surprises. Teams that are given the longest list of combinations hardly ever win the very first pick.\n\n\"There's no format that's perfect, but this is as close as you're going to get,\" Orlando Magic Executive Pat Williams said. \"I think the league has found the best system at this point.\"\n\nWilliams says the event is guaranteed to be entertaining. He has won the number 1 pick three times, making him the most successful participant in the lottery's 30-year history. \"It's a dramatic evening, particularly if there is an absolutely great player in the draft\" he said.\n\n## The Drawing Is Done In Secret\n\nThe private ping-pong ball drawing will take place in a hotel conference room more than an hour before the results are announced on television. Staff members from all 14 teams will attend along with NBA executives and news reporters.\n\nNobody can leave the ping-pong ball room until the TV broadcast is complete. Everyone has to give up their cellphones, computers and other devices before they go into the drawing. The NBA has to make sure the results stay secret until the TV show is over.\n\nLakers' team publicist John Black was in the private room for last year's ping-pong ball drawing. He says things got tense when another team unexpectedly jumped ahead of the Lakers.\n\n\"It was interesting, but it was a little bit frustrating,\" Black said. Big things were happening to the Lakers, but he couldn't tell the team's owners or the manager.\n\nBlack believes it is only natural to want to share that information right away. Still, he promises to keep this year's results a secret, even if it feels a bit \"weird.\"'"

            "text": "b\"LONDON - The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team - based in London, England. The team would be treated like any other in the league. It would play against U.S.-based teams and might even host a Super Bowl.\n\nAccording to a study released Wednesday, a new London team could be very good for Britain. It would likely earn more than $250 million a year for British businesses.\n\nHowever, the study also brings up a problem: It would likely be difficult to host a successful Super Bowl in the British capital. U.S. football fans could react badly to the idea of their Super Bowl being played there.\n\n## London Games Have Been Successful So Far\n\nPlans for a London team have been growing for some time. Ever since 2007, the NFL has had U.S. teams play a few games a year there. The success of those games led to the idea of London starting its own team.\n\nThe football games that are already played in London are part of the NFL's International Series. They feature U.S. teams and are part of the regular NFL season. So far this season, there have been two games played at London's famous Wembley Stadium. The third and final game at Wembley will be next Sunday.\n\nA new London team could mean a lot more money for city businesses. If the team hosts eight home games in a season, the study says, the city could see $165 million in higher profits. Those profits would mostly come from fans spending money. People attending games would spend money on things like food, souvenirs and hotels.\n\nThere would also be spending outside of London. With that added in, the boost from having a British NFL team is even larger. Throughout Britain as a whole, a London team could lead to $252 million in new profits per season.\n\n## What Time Is It?\n\nIn general, the study views the idea of a new team in London very favorably. However, it does raise serious doubts about holding the Super Bowl at Wembley.\n\nThe hardest thing about holding a Super Bowl in London would be choosing a good kickoff time. If the game started when it was 4 p.m. on the East Coast in the United States, that would mean it was kicking off at 9 p.m. in London. It would finish very late for Londoners. On a Sunday night, that could be a problem for many.\n\nOn the other hand, starting a Super Bowl when it was 6 p.m. in London would discourage TV viewers in the United States. It would only be 10 a.m. on the West Coast at that time.\n\n## Football Makes Lots Of Money\n\nAnother problem is that many big NFL fans in the United States would be unable to travel to London. With those fans absent, the game might feel less exciting.\n\nThe study also says U.S. fans could be angered by the idea of moving something as American as the Super Bowl overseas. They might believe the NFL had only one reason for wanting to have the Super Bowl there: to make more money for itself.\n\nAdding a new London team is not the only way the NFL can bring more money to Britain. The NFL could instead chose to increase the number of International Series games held in London. If it did that, the city would still benefit greatly.\n\nThe two games held in 2013 led to $52 million in profits for London, the study says. A switch to four games a year would make a big difference. It would likely bring an additional $42 million in profits, for a total of $94 million.\""

Most of all, she cannot wait to get down to work when the Arizona Cardinals open training camp this weekend.\n\nWelter is taking on a six-week internship position coaching inside linebackers for the Cardinals. She will be there only through training camp and the four preseason games. Nonetheless, it marks another barrier broken for women in sports.\n\nWelter said she never dared imagine coaching in the National Football League.\n\n\"I didn't even dream that it was possible,\" she said at news conference at Cardinals headquarters July 28. \"I think the beauty of this is that, though it's a dream I never could have had, now it's a dream other girls can grow up and have.\n\n\"She's a trailblazer,\" Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said.\n\n## She Has Player Experience Too\n\nTeam President Michael Bidwill said that Welter has the enthusiastic support of the Cardinals. The team has long been known for hiring minorities who are underrepresented. Bidwill said he spoke Monday night with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who congratulated the Cardinals on the move.\n\nKnown as Dr. Jen back in Texas, Welter has a doctorate degree in psychology, which is the study of the human mind and how it works.

Becky Hammon is an assistant with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n## Time For A New Message\n\nWelter said that for too long girls have been given the wrong message, that it is so important to be pretty.\n\n\"We teach them very early on to be pretty, marry well and then act badly and you'll get on TV,\" Welter said. \"That's what they grow up thinking what fame is or success is.\n\n\"I want little girls to grow up knowing that when they put their minds to something, when they work hard, they can do anything.\"\n\nAt the NFL owners meetings last March, Arians was asked about women coaching in the league.\n\n\"The minute they can prove they can make a player better, they'll be hired,\" Arians said.\n\nA short time later, the coach of the Texas Revolution men's team got in touch with Arians. He told Arians he knew someone who might be perfect.\n\nArians called Welter and offered her one of the team's six internships.\n\n## Football As First Love\n\nWelter grew up in Vero Beach, Florida. She told a story about when she could hardly see out of a football helmet. She would have her family drag a mattress outside so she could have the bigger kids tackle her.\n\nShe played rugby at Boston College but football was her first love. She spent 14 years as a linebacker, most of them with the Dallas Diamonds of the Women's Football Alliance. She won two gold medals with the American team at the International Federation of American Football women's world championships.\n\nWelter's first check, she said, came in 2004 - for $12, or $1 for each game she played. She still carries the check, which proved she was a pro.\n\nA year ago, the first barrier fell for her. She became the first woman to play a non-kicking position on a men's professional football team. Last February, she became the first woman to coach for a men's professional team when the Revolution made her a coach.\n\nThen Arians called. The two of them met, \"and I knew this was the type of person that I was looking for to start this,\" he said.\n\nWelter's internship will give her on-the-job-training. Arians called it a steppingstone to working full-time for the NFL.\n\nAnd that is exactly what Welter has her eye on.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES, Calif. - The scene was a normal one: a white airplane parked alongside a fence at Van Nuys Airport here. The one unusual part of the plane was the large blue horseshoe on its tail - the logo of the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nIt was a clear message. Only it wasn't to the people of Los Angeles, but to those back in Indiana worried that their National Football League (NFL) team might leave. The Colts wanted Indianapolis to build it a new stadium.\n\nThree years later, in 2005, the Colts started building the $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis. The team paid only $100 million. The city and state paid the other $620 million.\n\nLos Angeles had again been left without a team. The city has been more valuable to the NFL without a team than with one. Owners have used the threat of moving here to get new stadiums or improve old ones.\n\n## Here We Go Again\n\nFor Los Angeles, news this week that the owner of the St. Louis Rams plans to build a stadium in nearby Inglewood sounded all too familiar.\n\nMore than half of the NFL's 32 teams have used moving to Los Angeles as leverage since the Oakland Raiders and Rams left the city after the 1994 season. Some just put out rumors that they were thinking of moving to Los Angeles. Others seriously considered the idea.\n\nThe tactic works. Since the last pro game here, 27 NFL stadiums have been built or undergone at least $400 million in improvements.\n\nRams owner Stan Kroenke hasn't promised to bring his team. Still, his stadium plan marks the boldest step toward an NFL return since the Seattle Seahawks worked out in the city in 1996.\n\nKen Behring, then the owner of the Seahawks, wanted a new stadium. He said he was worried about earthquakes in Seattle, so he was considering a move to Southern California. It didn't sound like a real reason to people since Southern California has had its share of earthquakes. The NFL threatened a fine of $500,000 each week if the team didn't return, and soon the Seahawks were heading back to Seattle.\n\nThe Seahawks eventually got a brand new home field there.\n\n## Wait, Is This One For Real?\n\nKroenke's bid is different from past plans: It is the first time an NFL owner has had a stadium plan and a piece of land to build it on. Even experts on the history of football in California think the plan may be for real.\n\n\"The question really becomes: Los Angeles is the second-largest market in the country and can the NFL afford to continue to use it\" as a threat, said Bob Graziano, the former president of the L.A. Dodgers baseball team. In the 1990s, Graziano worked on the idea of an NFL stadium at Chavez Ravine, where the Dodgers play. \"Or at some point\" can the league make more money with a team in Los Angeles, he asked.\n\nThe idea of using a city as leverage isn't new. Florida's Tampa-St. Petersburg area filled the role for years in Major League Baseball, until 1998 when the Devil Rays (now the Rays) arrived. After the National Basketball Association's Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, Seattle became a spot for basketball teams interested in better deals from their cities. Las Vegas is mentioned as a possible city for a National Hockey League team, pretty much for the same reason.\n\nThe NFL has returned to each major city that has lost a team in the league, except Los Angeles.\n\n## \"One Guy On The Outside\"\n\nCozying up to Los Angeles hasn't always led to improved stadiums. The Raiders and San Diego Chargers, two of the most frequently discussed candidates to relocate, still occupy stadiums regarded as among the NFL's worst.\n\nEven without a team or two in Los Angeles, the NFL is the country's most popular - and profitable - sport. The league pulls in more than $9 billion each year.\n\n\"What's happened over the last 20 years is that the NFL hasn't taken a hit by not having a team in Los Angeles,\" said former Fox Sports President Ed Goren. He pointed out that the worth of teams has increased tenfold during that time. The league makes more money from its contracts with television stations that show the games than ever before. He said keeping Los Angeles \"open,\" with no team, has been a moneymaker.\n\n\"You always want one guy on the outside and you use him. It's just good business,\" he said.'"
