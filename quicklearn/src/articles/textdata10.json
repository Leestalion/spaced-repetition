            "text": "\tAs temperatures drop and the economy sputters along, many Americans aren't exactly in the mood to get their ghoul on this Halloween.\n\nAnna Harris of St. Paul, Minn., is among those cutting back this Halloween. \"Because I have less money,\" she explained.\n\nStill, Harris plans on celebrating by dressing up as Catwoman for two parties. At the St. Paul Wal-Mart store last week, she debated between a black-satin sequined cat mask vs. a leopard-festooned mask (with matching kitty tail). Both bore a price tag of about $5, and she plans on spending another $5 on makeup to complete her feline party look.\n\nFor retailers, Halloween is an important revenue bridge between the crucial back-to-school and Christmas buying seasons. And, despite early indications of shopper gloominess, 158 million consumers plan to celebrate Halloween in some manner this year - the most popular activity, of course, will be doling out candy.\n\n\"Halloween is one of the most popular holidays of the year, and while we are expecting people to cut back on their spending a bit this Halloween, there's no sense it will be a bust,\" said Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.\n\n\"It's a muddy picture,\" said George John, associate dean and marketing professor at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management. In terms of retail sales, \"We're trucking along. We're not falling off a cliff, but we're not surging upward, either,\" John added.\n\nA survey distributed recently by the NRF indicates that nearly 9 in 10 people plan to spend less on candy, costumes and decorations this Halloween season compared with last year. Total spending on the holiday is expected to reach the $6.9 billion mark nationwide this year - that's about $75.03 a person, on average, down from $79.82 last year.\n\nAbout a quarter of the 5,200-plus consumers surveyed cited the economy as the main reason for the decline.\n\n\"Unemployment has improved, but not at a solid rate that we would normally see when a recession ends. Consumer confidence has trended downward, so it's a slow improvement,\" John said. \"Sales for big retailers year-over-year are negative or marginally positive.\"\n\nSome Halloween enthusiasts plan on cutting back by buying \"a la carte\" - that is, investing in a piece or two, such as faux facial hair or just a mask, instead of a full-fledged costume.\n\nTarget Corp. capitalized on that trend by partnering with fashion and costume designer Chris March for a series of striking wigs that serve as the cornerstone of the retailer's Halloween collection. March, a former \"Project Runway\" contestant, designed eight styles: Geisha, Greaser, Starlet, Witch, Medusa, Monster Bride, Mohawk and Afro. Each sells for $20 or less.\n\nNot all retailers are reporting Halloween-spending skittishness among their customers. Consumers nationwide are expected to spend a little over $1 billion on children's costumes and $1.2 billion on adult costumes, according to the NRF-sponsored survey.\n\n\"We're definitely not seeing people spending less,\" said Roberta Bonoff, CEO and president of the Minneapolis-based children's store Creative Kidstuff. \"People are still buying. Kids are kids, and they celebrate Halloween. No matter what goes on in the world, people will spend on their kids.\"\n\nTop sellers at the six-store chain include police, firefighter, vampire and magician costumes. Plus, smaller pleasures, including spider-web earrings and people paints, are hot this season.\n\nAnother area where consumers are less likely to cut back: pet costumes.\n\nAbout 13.8 percent of those surveyed for NRF say they will take extra time to find the \"perfect costume\" for their pet. All told, consumers are expected to spend $330 million on costumes for their four-legged companions.\n\nPopular doggy costumes trending on Google Shopping include hot dog, Wonder Woman, Ewok and matador get-ups.'"

            "title": "Bakken truckers often \"haul heavy\"",
            "text": "\tWATFORD CITY, N.D. - The dump truck rumbled over miles of unpaved roads in the hills just east of the Montana border, past the cattle and grain bins and haystacks, before arriving at the dirt pit. Bill Gore slid his truck onto the scale, inched up in line, and made a curving gesture to the man in the front-end loader.\n\nThat was the signal to pile the dirt on high, and the loader did: Gore's five-axle truck pulled out of the pit north of Cartwright last week weighing 19,000 pounds more than its registered limit of 82,000 pounds.\n\n\"We try to run it as hard as we can,\" said Gore, who's been driving trucks here for four years.\n\nHeavy trucks are the backbone of the Bakken oil fields, transporting the water, pipes and sand needed to produce more than 1 million barrels of oil a day in western North Dakota. They move oil rigs from site to site, crude to pipelines and rail terminals, and dirt and construction materials to build the new roads, homes and businesses needed to serve the exploding population of new workers.\n\nBut the frenzied pace of the oil fields and spotty enforcement by authorities have encouraged the rise of overweight trucks. State authorities estimate that one-quarter of the Bakken's water trucks alone are overloaded.\n\nTrucks hauling larger loads than what they were designed for pose safety concerns because extra weight lessens their braking power and increases the potential damage they could cause in a collision. On the crowded Bakken roads, truck crashes that led to severe injuries jumped twelvefold during a recent four-year period. And 100,000-pound trucks, which are common in oil-field traffic, take 25 percent longer to stop than 80,000-pound trucks, according to the Truck Safety Coalition.\n\nHeavy trucks also degrade bridges more quickly and crumble prairie roads built for light farm traffic, prompting the state to make record investments in rebuilding roads and bridges and constructing new bypasses.\n\nIn McKenzie County, the state's top oil producer, the tiny sheriff's office has a file cabinet containing enormous violations. A driver from an Alexandria, Minnesota, company was pulled over this summer while hauling a crane that was 61,300 pounds overweight. A trucker from a Clear Lake, Minnesota, company was caught driving 76,100 pounds overweight while carrying an excavator.\n\nTrucker Michael Fisher, who acknowledged driving overweight, said one problem is being able to adequately slow down.\n\n\"It's the stopping power,\" he said, adding that he tried to keep more distance from other vehicles. \"Your brakes are set up to stop a certain amount of weight, and if you increase that, you have a lot more chance of something going wrong.\"\n\nHis truck jangling over a rutted, muddy lot, a South Dakota man named Scott pulled up to one of six stations at the water depot in Alexander.\n\nHe hooked a hose up to the station and punched into a kiosk the amount he wanted pumped: 130 barrels. Scott's truck, registered to haul 80,000 pounds, now weighed about 85,000. But he was paid $2 for every barrel he hauled to an oil pad near Watford City, 20 miles away, and with six loads a day, adding on 10 barrels each time netted him an extra $120.\n\nIn interviews that spanned water depots, truck stops and rides across oil field roads, drivers here described pressures to \"haul heavy.\" They said jobs that pay by the ton or load, rather than by the hour, offer an incentive to overload their trucks.\n\n\"You have to go heavy just to keep up with the wells,\" said Jesse Scheffler, who once got a $3,000 ticket for driving a truck that was 20,000 pounds overweight. \"We didn't come to North Dakota for the scenery. We're here for money.\"\n\nAlan Dybing, a researcher at the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute, a think tank on transportation issues, has studied the issue. \"If you look at the expected benefit vs. the expected cost of getting caught, in many cases right now the benefit exceeds the cost, so that's why we're seeing a lot of this,\" he said.\n\nAt the water depot at Love's truck stop in Williston, attendants cut drivers off after they have taken on 150 barrels. Even so, a recent log showed three people tried to fill up to 160 barrels.\n\nTruckers are quick to let each other know when police are out and which routes to avoid. After word spread of a state official weighing each truck coming through a dirt pit earlier this year, one trucker dumped his load out at the side of the road.\n\nHalfway through his shift, the McKenzie County sheriff's deputy knew he'd hit a prize as the water truck sped down County Road 10, tires bulging. The driver admitted he was carrying 180 barrels, a substantial load.\n\nScott Luhman pulled six scales from his squad car, placing them next to each row of tires on the back three axles.\n\nThe truck weighed in at more than 113,000 pounds - nearly 25,000 pounds over what it was licensed to haul. Local roads around the Bakken often have limits based on a truck's number of axles, allowing those with more axles to haul more weight.\n\nThe driver was fined $5,200.\n\nBut Luhman lamented that such catches are too rare in his department. McKenzie County fined just 33 trucks last year, down from 54 in 2012. For the first nine months of the year it issued 24 violations.\n\nThere are only two officers charged with the time-consuming task of truck-weight enforcement.\n\n\"(The state's) lack of enforcement causes trucks to be out there that are unsafe, and they're letting down the general public with that,\" Luhman said.\n\nThe North Dakota Highway Patrol has shifted resources to the western region but still has only 17 troopers in Bakken who are exclusively responsible for commercial vehicle enforcement. State troopers ticketed 1,318 overweight trucks last year, just slightly more than 1,188 in 2004, well before the oil boom. Enforcement today is down from 1,701 violations in 2012. Captain Eldon Mehrer said he isn't sure why, but he thinks truckers are responding to enforcement.\n\nA sporadically manned weigh station in Williston closed this spring and a new one won't open for more than a year. The squat, beige building at the bustling corner of Highway 85 and Route 2 is easy to miss, and 65 trucks roared through the intersection in one 15-minute period.\n\nBakken's lucrative trucking business includes a mix of large and established companies and small and independent operators.\n\n\"The bigger companies generally are better,\" Luhman said. \"It is the smaller companies. It's Joe Blow ... that's out here trying to save his family. He's going to push the rules a little bit more, but these guys are just trying to make more money. They're not necessarily having criminal intent.\"\n\nSunday morning, chugging down Route 200 near the \\xc2\\xadYellowstone River. Fisher, the truck driver, turned onto an unpaved road and bounced over ruts and potholes on the way to the dirt pit.\n\nThe dispatcher had told him and his friend, Gore, the job would pay $9.50 a ton to haul the load to Watford City's water treatment plant, about 40 miles away.\n\nHe pulled onto the scale so the pit could measure the truck's \"tare weight\" - empty - and then pulled into line. Fisher flashed the man operating the front-end loader a \"three\" and \"five\" with his hands to signal that he wanted 35 tons, then lit up a Marlboro Red as the man dropped giant buckets of dirt into his truck. Fisher gave him a thumbs up and pulled onto the scale.\n\nThe side of his five-axle truck said its capacity was 80,000 pounds, but the attendant handed him a ticket showing that it now weighed a little more than 104,000.\n\n\"You're a lightweight,\" Gore joked.\n\nLess than an hour later, Gore and Fisher pulled into the Watford site, where many other trucks waited in disarray. The men idled. Everything was taking longer than expected, and Gore worried the truck wasn't making enough money.\n\nHeading north back to the pit, Gore fielded a call about another job that would pay $100 an hour. He decided they would take it after running one more trip to the dirt pit.\n\n\"If I work by the hour,\" Gore said, \"I can haul legal loads.\"'"

            "text": "\tHungarian lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bill that will ban most shopping on Sundays, casting the move as insurance that families will have more time together.\n\nBut in a country struggling with 10.5 percent unemployment and modest income levels even a quarter of a century after the end of communist rule, the bill limiting retail activity is likely to come in for some popular resentment if, as retailers warn, it results in layoffs and a drop in tax revenue.\n\nThe law, reminiscent of postwar Western European restrictions against shopping on the Christian Sabbath, is the political brainchild of Hungary's Christian Democratic People's Party, the junior partner in coalition with Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz conservatives. Like its German, Austrian, Dutch and other predecessors, the Hungarian shopping ban is riddled with exceptions.\n\nPharmacies, tobacconists, farmers markets and stores on military bases are permitted to operate on Sundays. Bakeries can also open between 5 a.m. and noon.\n\nRetail shops at airports, train stations, gas stations and hospitals are allowed to operate as late as 10 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nShops with less than 2,150 square feet of retail space aren't covered by the law, provided that the Sunday workforce consists of those with at least a 20 percent stake in the business or are immediate family members of the owners.\n\nThe four Sundays preceding Christmas are exempt from the shopping ban, and all retailers will be allowed to open their doors once a year on a Sunday of their choosing.\n\nThe National Association of Entrepreneurs and Employers, which opposed the legislation, warned this month that its passage would lead to about 20,000 layoffs. It vowed to organize a national referendum on the shopping ban, citing an Economics Ministry report that about 20 percent of Hungarians do the bulk of their weekly shopping on Sundays.\n\nAbout 37 percent of Hungary's 10 million population is Roman Catholic, according to the CIA World Factbook. An additional 16 percent ascribe to other Christian religions, while 18 percent say they are atheists and 27 percent fail to specify any faith.\n\nThere were no economic impact studies conducted by the government before the bill was submitted, the Hungarian business news site Portfolio reported in its account of the legislation, which concluded that \"economic rationale for the move is scarce.\"\n\nThe shopping curbs, which take effect March 15, will mostly affect big-box retailers and major European grocery chains such as Spar, Aldi, Tesco and Lidl.\n\nIn a description of the legislation posted on the parliamentary website, the sponsoring lawmakers promoted it as insurance that shopping won't \"shorten the time that families spend together.\"\n\nEconomy Minister Mihaly Varga had urged rejection of the bill, appealing instead for employers to work out mutually agreeable compensation arrangements for those willing to work Sundays.'"

            "text": "\tNEW DELHI - The Jariwal household could barely contain its joy on a recent weekday afternoon as family members prepared for their oldest daughter's wedding: The invitations had been delivered, a venue chosen, hotel reservations made.\n\nBut there was the gold problem.\n\nGold is far more than just a nice thing to wear at Indian weddings. It's a key element of the religion and culture in a country that consumes 20 percent of global production of the metal. In India it is status symbol, sign of respect, inflation hedge, repository of emergency savings and, of course, something to make the bride shine.\n\nBut the nation's swooning economy, marked by a sharp drop in its currency in recent weeks, has pushed gold prices sharply higher, pain that's been compounded by a government decision to increase import duties on precious metals to 10 percent from 4 percent.\n\nThat's left people like Kusum Jariwal, 47, a teacher and proud mother of the bride, grappling with some intricate social engineering as the December wedding date looms.\n\nFor one thing, there'll be a single \"not too weighty\" gold necklace-and-earrings set for daughter Kanika, 25, rather than the two that Jariwal had planned. It also means a pendant rather than a chain for the mother-in-law-to-be. Plus a ring and watch for the groom - can't really skimp there - from a well-known jeweler because his family is a bit brand-conscious.\n\n\"We have to buy more, but prices are crazy,\" Jariwal said. \"We'll just have to make do with less.\"\n\nThe government's decision to increase the tax on gold just before the November-February wedding season indicates how worried Indian economic planners have become as fiscal deficits have soared, the trade deficit has hit 4.6 percent and stocks have headed for the basement, knocking nearly $100 billion off the market's value in August.\n\nAdding to the bad-news drumbeat, foreign reserves have fallen to $280 billion, or the equivalent of seven months worth of imports, and economic growth has plunged to 4.4 percent, less than half its 2010-11 level.\n\nMeanwhile, the rupee's 16 percent decline against the dollar this year has made it among Asia's worst-performing currencies, forcing Indians to pay more for gasoline, imported medicines, foreign trips and education.\n\n\"India has become the sick man of Asia,\" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist with IHS, a market information firm. \"Global investors have gradually realized in 2012 and 2013 that the Indian government is 'wearing no clothes' in the area of economic policy reforms.\"\n\nOil is India's largest import, and significantly increasing taxes on it could choke growth. So the government has aggressively targeted gold, the nation's second-largest import, in a bid to shore up foreign reserves, restore confidence and prevent further economic deterioration before next year's general election.\n\nIt's also allowing public-sector companies and banks to raise funds overseas and is boosting import duties on other \"nonessential\" imports, including a 35 percent tax on flat-screen TVs brought in by airline passengers.\n\nAt New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, Naeem Ahmad, 32, emerged from the arrival hall last month with two bags, a 40-inch Samsung flat-screen TV and a big grin after barely avoiding the hefty tax that would be imposed a few days later.\n\nStill, he said, the higher fuel prices are hurting his family, and they have put off buying clothes and going on vacation.\n\n\"Our government doesn't care,\" he said, returning from a several-month stint working in a shop in Saudi Arabia. \"They're fleecing us. This import duty is just another example.\"\n\nIndia is hardly the only developing country whose economy is struggling as higher U.S. bond prices and signs of an American economic recovery encourage investors to flee riskier markets. But critics say Indian policymakers could have stepped in earlier to shore things up instead of waiting for a crisis.\n\n\"The government's taken steps, like stopping TVs, that the market reads as panic,\" said Arun Kumar, an economics professor with New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. \"Things are looking more and more precarious. It's too little too late.\"\n\nThe steps India needs to take are evident, the critics said, but they are politically difficult. They include cutting subsidies and other populist welfare policies that drive up government deficits; reducing red tape, opaque regulations and inconsistent tax policies that deter investors; intervening in currency markets earlier; and addressing a string of corruption scandals in the defense, real estate, telecommunications, mining and sports sectors.\n\n\"Bureaucrats and politicians are in paralysis and don't want to make decisions because all around them is some sort of scam,\" Kumar said. \"The country's still too dependent on crony capitalism rather than market investment.\"\n\nIndia, which cut diesel subsidies last year and has eased restrictions on foreign retailers, isn't the first country to delay tough reforms. Some analysts hope its growing economic problems will spur change in the way its near-insolvency helped pry open the economy in 1991.\n\nBut it's unclear whether the government can chip away at Indians' love of gold, which economists consider a \"nonproductive asset\" that sits idle in safe-deposit boxes rather than fueling growth. Previous attempts to severely restrict or license its import have failed.\n\nBiswas predicts that the latest gold tax will only encourage smuggling and provide an opportunity for organized crime. Last month, two Sri Lankans were reportedly caught in western India's Goa state with several pounds of gold, valued at more than $10 million, in their body cavities. Customs officials had noticed them walking awkwardly.\n\nIn May, a jeweler died in a tunnel collapse after a witch doctor convinced him there was a mass of gold under his house.\n\nIt's tough to change a culture that believes gold should mark every phase of life, from birth to dowry to childbirth to death, said Partha Nath Mukherji, professor emeritus of sociology at New Delhi's Institute of Social Sciences.\n\nIt's evidenced in a love of glitter, be it solid-gold furniture, cricket bats, idols, temple doors or chain-mail shirts worth millions of dollars. Gold is enshrined in ancient Hindu legends as well as the latest marketing campaigns, such as those for 24K-gold-plated iPhones. When Tata Motors wanted to draw attention to its Nano car model in 2011, it coated one of the vehicles with 176 pounds of gold and gems, gaining far more in publicity than the $3 million value of the shiny stunt.\n\nIn the Jariwals' small living room, decorated with brown wicker furniture, orange pillows and artificial flowers, three generations of women proudly displayed their gold earrings and necklaces in worn jewelry boxes.\n\nBride Kanika, a bank executive who admits being a \"riot of emotions\" right now, said she suggested the family stop obsessing about the gold, given all the added expense and stress. But her mother wouldn't hear of it.\n\nOn one point everyone in the family agrees: Indians will never stop buying the stuff.\n\n\"Two years ago, gold prices were way down,\" the mother said with a sigh. \"Oh, how I wish I'd bought more. Why didn't I just go for it?\"'"

            "text": "\tTEHRAN, Iran - Iran's nuclear accord with world powers may herald a new era for the Islamic Republic, but there is little sense on the bustling streets of the nation's capital that momentous change is imminent.\n\nOfficial efforts to tamp down expectations and obscure details of the accord appear to have left many ordinary Iranians mystified - and worried as ever about diminished purchasing power and scarce job opportunities in the sanctions-battered economy.\n\nSunday officially marked \"adoption day,\" 90 days after the accord was signed in Vienna by Iran and six other nations, including the United States. Tehran must now begin imposing new constraints on its nuclear program in exchange for promised sanctions relief.\n\nStill, many ordinary Iranians are openly skeptical that things will get much better - or just not sure what all the fuss is about.\n\n\"I can't figure out what this deal is, but I hope it will be good for us,\" said Bahram Asgari, 54, a carpet salesman and father of three who was outside the capital's pulsing Grand Bazaar. \"All I know is that prices keep going up and it is harder and harder to make ends meet, no matter what the politicians say.\"\n\nIn the underground gold market, where shop windows glittered with bracelets, rings, necklaces and other baubles, vendors said sales had been desultory.\n\n\"Business is very slack,\" said Asghar Nouzad, 40, seeming depressed as he manned his stall. \"I don't see much to hope for in the future.\"\n\nOn Sunday, official news outlets quoted President Hassan Rouhani as warning that no tangible benefits are expected until spring, when Iran's key oil sector may finally shed most sanctions. It was another dose of reality meant to curb unrealistic beliefs that the deal is some kind of panacea. But few here seem to believe that anyway.\n\nLast week, Iranian lawmakers officially signed off on the nuclear deal, signaling an end to what has often been an incendiary debate.\n\nHypersensitive to any suggestion that it has made concessions to Washington, Iran's conservative leadership has ramped up anti-Western rhetoric. In recent days, the military theatrically unveiled a new generation of long-range ballistic missiles, hidden deep underground - predictably drawing sharp rebuke from the Obama administration.\n\nWestern officials say it will take months for Iran to begin to comply with a number of complex nuclear deal mandates, including reducing uranium-enrichment capabilities, shrinking enriched uranium stocks and beginning the scale-down of existing nuclear facilities. Sanctions relief is scheduled to come online sometime in 2016, officials say.\n\nBecause of economic hardship, many Iranians have been forced to take several jobs. Many pensioners, their monthly stipends steadily declining in real value, have taken to driving taxis.\n\nAli Reza, 62, retired 10 years ago after working as a technician with the Iranian air force, maintaining U.S.-made fighter jets left over from the monarchy days. His pension, worth the equivalent of $2,500 a month a decade ago, is now valued at about $600 a month.\n\n\"I have three children; my benefits aren't enough,\" said Reza, who now works as a cabdriver to supplement his income.\n\n\"Nothing will ever change here,\" he said, adding that he had little expectation of economic progress after the nuclear accord.\n\nCasual conversations here suggest a higher level of hope among Iran's youth, major supporters of Rouhani, who was elected in June 2013 with a pledge to end international sanctions. Young Iranians dominated street celebrations after Rouhani's surprise victory two years ago and after ratification of the nuclear deal in July.\n\n\"I just hope people have more money to spend so they can invest more in decorating their homes,\" said Parisa Jalili, 24, an interior decorator who was with her boyfriend, Ramin Haderi, at the Naderi restaurant, a bohemian haunt close to the British Embassy.\n\nMany in Iran's young and highly educated population have found it difficult to find employment commensurate with their skills and education levels.\n\nHaderi, 25, an engineer earning the equivalent of about $600 a month, said he was optimistic about an influx of foreign investment and the initiation of much-needed infrastructure projects.\n\n\"I'd say there's a cautious optimism out there now,\" said Sam Madikians, an Iranian-born Californian who owns the Naderi restaurant and travels to Iran frequently.\n\nBut Iran's clerical leadership has been repeatedly making a point: Sanctions relief and greater foreign investment in Iran do not signify a greater opening to the West.\n\nAt Friday prayers on the grounds of Tehran University, a leading cleric, 88-year-old Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, warned that Western values - including homosexuality - were not welcome.\n\n\"Yes, we made the nuclear deal, but that's it,\" said Abbas Khorramabadi, 44, a civil servant eagerly participating in a \"morals\" march after the fiery sermon. \"We will not allow for any other compromises. ... No Western values shall prevail.\"'"

            "text": "\tBAGHDAD - Islamic State militants have provoked a global outcry by attacking ancient monuments with jackhammers and bulldozers. But they also have been quietly selling off smaller antiquities from Iraq and Syria, earning millions of dollars in an increasingly organized pillaging of national treasures, according to officials and experts.\n\nThe Islamic State has defended its destruction of cultural artifacts by saying they are idolatrous and represent pre-Islamic cultures. Behind the scenes, though, the group's looting has become so systematic that Islamic State has incorporated the practice into the structure of its self-declared caliphate, granting licenses for digging in historic sites through a department of \"precious resources.\"\n\nThe growing trade reflects how the Islamic State fighters have entrenched themselves since seizing the Iraqi city of Mosul a year ago Wednesday, in a dramatic expansion of the territory they control in this country and neighboring Syria.\n\nThe extremist group's recent capture of Syria's majestic 2,000-year-old ruins at Palmyra threw a spotlight on the risk that Islamic State poses to the region's rich cultural heritage. It is however, just one of 4,500 sites under the group's control, according to the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force.\n\n\"They steal everything that they can sell, and what they can't sell, they destroy,\" said Qais Hussein Rasheed, Iraq's deputy minister for antiquities and heritage.\n\n\"We have noticed that the smuggling of antiquities has greatly increased since last June,\" he added, referring to the month in which Islamic State militants took control of Mosul and large parts of northern Iraq.\n\nAt that time, militants also seized the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh. In a video released earlier this year, Islamic State showed its fighters drilling off the faces of the mighty stone-winged bulls on the gates of the city. The militants also filmed themselves destroying statues at Mosul's museum. But many of those items were actually replicas of antiquities kept in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said. Anything genuine and small enough to move was likely sold off or stockpiled by the militants, they said.\n\nIraq has suffered from years of despoilment of its historic sites, as thieves have taken advantage of instability in the country. The sacking of the poorly guarded national museum in Baghdad after the U.S. invasion in 2003 was decried around the world.\n\nIslamic State's plundering began in a haphazard fashion when the extremists first gained a foothold in Syria. But the trade has become more organized as the group has conquered territory.\n\nIslamic State grants licenses for the excavation of ancient sites through its \"Diwan al-Rikaz\" - a governing body for overseeing resources in the \"caliphate.\" The body has a department for oil and gas, as well as antiquities, documentation from the group shows.\n\n\"Islamic State has incorporated the activity of excavation into its bureaucracy,\" said Aymenn al-Tamimi, a researcher on jihadist groups at the Britain-based Middle East Forum who has compiled an archive of Islamic State administrative documents.\n\nHow much Islamic State earns from the trade is difficult to estimate. Iraqi officials say it is the group's second-most-important commercial activity after oil sales, earning the militants tens of millions of dollars.\n\nWith the extremist group struggling to maintain its oil revenue in the wake of U.S. airstrikes that damaged infrastructure, experts and officials worry that Islamic State - also known as ISIS or ISIL - might focus even more on illegal excavations.\n\n\"It's a dependable source of revenue, which makes it very attractive, and it's surprisingly untapped,\" said Michael Danti, a professor of archaeology at Boston University. \"Over time, we've seen ISIL and organizations like it increase their ability to draw revenue from these crimes.\"\n\nDanti, who advises the State Department on the trade in plundered antiquities from Iraq and Syria, said some looted items have made their way to U.S. and other Western markets - especially antiquities in the lower- and medium-price ranges, such as stone seals with cuneiform inscriptions.\n\nLarger, more conspicuous items will probably go through a laundering process that takes years and involves the forging of documents to suggest a legal provenance. To be traded legally, the items must have been excavated or exported before 1970, when a UNESCO convention came into force prohibiting trade in such cultural property. But the market is poorly regulated and the Archaeological Institute of America estimates that as much as 90 percent of classical artifacts in collections may be stolen antiquities.\n\nSmaller items from Iraq and Syria are now \"flooding the market\" and are widely sold online, said Deborah Lehr, the co-founder of the Antiquities Coalition, which aims to end \"cultural racketeering.\" She said her organization has been emailed by brokers selling smuggled antiquities who mistakenly took her group for collectors.\n\n\"There needs to be better education and better regulation,\" she said. \"The public needs to know that by purchasing these items, people are potentially funding terrorism.\"\n\nIn Baghdad, officials say they are doing what they can to stem the flow, but Islamic State is utilizing decades-old smuggling networks that sprung up as the robbery of artifacts increased.\n\nDuring the first Gulf War in 1991, and uprisings that followed it, thousands of items were lost as thieves took advantage of Saddam Hussein's loosened grip on the country's heritage sites.\n\nThe U.S.-led invasion in 2003 brought more looting, with sites left completely unprotected. Thieves stole thousands of ancient objects from the national museum in Baghdad.\n\nFrom Iraq, antiquities are smuggled to Kuwait, Israel and Turkey, all regional transit hubs, said Col. Firas Hussein Abed, an Iraqi army commander who oversaw an investigation into a smuggling ring in April.\n\nA bust by his officers led to the arrest of four people and the recovery of 25 items, which experts are examining to ascertain whether they came from Islamic State-controlled sites.\n\nAround Mosul, there are reports of widespread digging for ancient objects to sell. Amr al-Julaimi, a lecturer in Mosul University's antiquities department until it was closed by Islamic State, said residents have informed him that the group is excavating areas around the tomb of Jonah, the prophet famed in Islam and Christianity for being swallowed by a whale. The tomb was destroyed last July by the group, which deemed it idolatrous.\n\n\"The longer until Mosul is liberated, the more the danger that our human legacy will be wiped out,\" he said.\n\nOne indicator of how rapidly the illegal trade may be growing is the number of declared imports into the United States of antiquities said to be excavated long enough ago to be legal to trade.\n\nThe value of antiques and ancient artifacts from Iraq imported into the United States jumped fourfold between 2010 and 2014, reaching more than $3.5 million, according to U.S. International Trade Commission figures. Imports from Syria and Egypt have also rocketed.\n\n\"It's highly suspicious,\" said Danti, the Boston University professor. \"These spikes in supposed legal imports perfectly correlate with the breakdown in law and order in these countries. I'd be shocked if all of it was legal.\"\n\nIn Iraq, Rasheed advocates a blanket ban on the trade in antiquities from the country. In the same compound as his office is the national museum, recently reopened to the public for the first time since 2003 in what officials described as an act of defiance against Islamic State destruction.\n\n\"The Iraqi people need to be able to witness their history, their diversity,\" Rasheed said. \"What's happening is a tragedy.\"'"

            "title": "As Europe makes room for refugees, some in Japan ask: Why not us?",
            "text": "\tTOKYO - When Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, was visiting Egypt earlier this year, he pledged $200 million in aid for refugees displaced by the rise of the so-called Islamic State. \"We are going to provide assistance for refugees and displaced persons from Iraq and Syria,\" he said.\n\nNow, as a torrent of refugees flows out of the Middle East and into Europe, many people are wondering why rich Gulf nations and the United States are not doing more to help. And some in Japan are also wondering if their country should be doing more than giving money.\n\nAfter all, Japan has offered zero resettlement places for refugees from Syria, according to Amnesty International, although the Japan Association for Refugees says three were granted refugee status in 2013.\n\nEither way, there have been mounting calls here for a more inclusive policy.\n\n\"There are things Japan can do,\" the Mainichi Shimbun, a left-leaning Japanese paper, wrote in an editorial on Tuesday, adding that Tokyo could be more actively supporting the countries that are taking in Syrian refugees, especially Turkey and Jordan.\n\n\"Japan is called 'a country with a closed door for refugees.' We should change this closed nature and consider accepting refugees from conflict zones proactively,\" the paper said. \"Figuring out how to tackle this humanitarian crisis is not an issue only for Europe.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Yasunori Kawakami, a former Middle East correspondent for Asahi Shimbun who now freelances from Egypt, has been encouraging his compatriots to open their doors - and their minds - to Syrian refugees.\n\nWhile Japan can't solve the problem, it can help ease the despair felt by some Middle East youth, he said.\n\n\"The root of this despair comes from them feeling completely isolated. The world is turning their back on them. Is it OK for Japan to continue to turn its back on them too?\" he asked.\n\nIn another tweet, he said that the Syrian children who had died trying to get across the Mediterranean were just Arab versions of Chibi Maruko-chan and Kureyon Shin-chan, Japanese anime characters who are also popular in the Middle East.\n\n\"Japan needs to sympathize with those children who became refugees,\" he wrote. \"Japan has been asking for empathy for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, after all,\" he said, referring to the cities devastated by atomic bombs at the end of World War II.\n\nAccording to the Amnesty report, Japan is not alone among high-income countries in not taking in refugees from Syria. It noted that Russia, Singapore and South Korea were also in the zero resettlement club.\n\nBut Japan, which has gone to great lengths to rehabilitate its image since World War II, prides itself on being a good global citizen. It is one of the largest aid donors in the world. Last year Japan gave $181.6 million to the UNHCR, the U.N.'s refugee agency, making it second only to the United States in generosity.\n\nWhen it comes to putting its mouth where its money is, however, Japan is not doing well. It accepted just 11 asylum-seekers out of a record 5,000 applications last year, according to Ministry of Justice data, giving Japan a refugee recognition rate of just 0.2 percent, one of the lowest among industrialized economies.\n\n\"The low recognition rate is shameful,\" immigration lawyer Shogo Watanabe told Reuters when the statistics were released. But this was almost double the number taken in during 2013, when Japan accepted just six refugees, the lowest number in 15 years.\n\nOthers have called Japan's acceptance rate \"miserly.\" \"Japan has done less than any other large democracy to alleviate the refugee crisis through granting asylum,\" Japanese journalist Harada Kazuyoshi wrote on Nippon.com, a website partly funded by the government, earlier this year.\n\nImmigration is a touchy issue in Japan, an astonishingly homogeneous country where outsiders often remain \"the other\" - even if they've lived here for decades and speak perfect Japanese. That makes it a hard place for refugees to settle into.\n\nIndeed, Gloria Okafor Ifeoma, a Nigerian asylum-seeker who arrived in Tokyo in 2007, told The Economist earlier this year that she had spent about 30 months under lock and key. Immigration officials give the impression that they just want refugees to leave, she said.\n\nBut Japan also faces a demographic time bomb - one that could be significantly eased by an influx of new people. With its rapidly aging population and paltry birth rate, Japan is getting smaller and grayer by the year.\n\nJapan's government estimates that the country's population will shrink from the current 127 million to 95 million by 2050, and by that stage, 40 percent of Japanese will be over the age of 65. Who's going to pay for their retirement and their healthcare?\n\nAnd it's not as if Japan doesn't have the space. The New York Times recently reported that there are 8 million \"ghost homes\" in Japan already, as the population shrinks and people move to the cities. This phenomenon prompted one real estate expert to warn: \"Tokyo could end up being surrounded by Detroits.\"\n\nBut many in Japan, as in the United States, consider the Syrian refugee crisis to be a distant, European responsibility.\n\n\"I'm against accepting Syrian refugees,\" Nobuo Ikeda, a lecturer at Aoyama Gakuin University who runs Agora Web, an online opinion site for policy experts, wrote on Twitter. \"Wars in Middle East are the result of British and French colonial rule and America overemphasizing its relationship with Israel. The only thing to be done is for them to apologize and atone for their sins.\"\n\nSome are opposed to Japan taking in refugees on economic grounds. Although the Japanese economy appears to be emerging from two decades of deflation, growth remains weak and consumers remain skittish.\n\n\"Immigrants can work and the tax burden on the state would be low,\" wrote Tomoaki Ueda, a Twitter user from Kyoto who uses the handle @NeoTechLab. \"But refugee status is just the same as being on welfare. And refugees need language and other help, so they'd be a big burden on Japanese people. That's why it's a problem.\"'"

            "text": "\tFor many in Vietnam, the question has been fraught with impatience and even concern: why isn't there a McDonald's there?\n\nDecades after the Vietnam War, and years after the Communist-run country re-engaged with the world, Vietnam will pass another symbolic milestone as a contributor to the global economy when its first McDonald's opens next year in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nOak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp. already operates around the globe. Getting to Vietnam has taken a little more time, but there was little doubt one of the world's most recognizable brands would take on another developing country with a growing middle class.\n\nFor Vietnam, McDonald's Corp. is turning to a partner with a uniquely American experience: Henry Nguyen, a private equity investor with a medical degree and MBA from Northwestern University who worked at the Golden Arches as a teenager.\n\nNguyen was born in Vietnam and fled with his family as a toddler in the final days of the war, just before Saigon fell. He returned to the country more than 12 years ago and is a highly visible [entrepreneur](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) whose father-in-law, Nguyen Tan Dung, is the country's prime minister.\n\nNguyen fondly recalls the french fries and hot fudge sundae he enjoyed on his first trip to McDonald's as a 4-year-old. Ten years later, he was making fries and working the front counter. \"It's a love affair with the brand that started as a young boy,\" Nguyen said in a phone interview Tuesday from Australia.\n\nNguyen, 39, and McDonald's believe rising disposable income and a young, urban population in the country of 90 million will spell success for the company in its 119th market.\n\n\"This current young generation is Vietnam's golden generation,\" Nguyen said. \"They will be the ones leading the market and economic development, the ones who are going to change consumption habits.\"\n\nNguyen said that while McDonald's has had difficulty translating its cuisine in other parts of Asia like Japan, where consumers aren't accustomed to touching their food, Vietnam was a French colony, and people there are used to bread and using their hands to eat.\n\nAnd just because there isn't a McDonald's, Nguyen doesn't think consumers there have much learning to do.\n\n\"More than two-thirds of the people here in Vietnam have heard of McDonald's brand, and the vast majority think of it in very positive light,\" he said. \"It's seen as an iconic global company with iconic food products like the Big Mac and Happy Meal.\"\n\nNguyen's bet is emblematic of a sea change underway in Vietnam, a country with which the United States shares a tragic history. The nation joined the World Trade Organization in 2007 and has eased restrictions on multinational corporations since then.\n\n\"It's a market we've wanted to get into, and one of the things was finding the right partner,\" said Mike Flores, vice president of global restaurant development at McDonald's. \"It's also a market that long term, like all of our markets, we wanted to be fairly self-sufficient from a talent and supply chain standpoint, and I think we felt we had enough infrastructure geography that we could effectively get it off the ground and grow.\"\n\nFlores said McDonald's has watched Vietnam's highly educated young population and seen manufacturing investment being diverted from China, another country where the chain has seen success.\n\n\"As China has been building its middle class, manufacturing is moving more into Southeast Asia, and Vietnam is picking up the overflow,\" he said.\n\nStarbucks opened its first location in Ho Chi Minh City this year, which really raised questions about McDonald's plans.\n\n\"I've had so many friends, colleagues and others ask, 'Why isn't there a McDonald's here?' \" Nguyen said. \" 'Do they think there's something wrong with Vietnam?' \"\n\nElizabeth Friend, consumer food service analyst at Euromonitor, said Vietnam has a $33 billion food service industry, making it the 20th-largest market in the world. Although Pizza Hut, KFC and Subway also have locations in Vietnam, chain restaurants only rang up $216 million in receipts last year.\n\n\"Maybe people haven't caught on to chains,\" she said. \"But you can also see there is a huge untapped potential to move in and claim that market share.\"\n\nDisposable income has doubled in Vietnam since 2007, to nearly $1,000 per capita, Friend said, citing Euromonitor data.\n\nNguyen, who founded Good Day Hospitality, a corporation that will run his McDonald's franchise in Vietnam, has taken on an even more public life since marrying the prime minister's daughter.\n\nHe expressed some surprise at media reports that seemed to link his McDonald's deal to his family. He underscored that he's been talking with McDonald's about coming to Vietnam for more than a decade and said he was selected through a grueling search process, during which the burger giant sifted through hundreds of applications and interviewed more than 50 people or companies for the first franchise.\n\nAs the entrepreneur poised to introduce the Big Mac - and the drive-thru concept - to Vietnam, Nguyen said he understands he will face challenges, from nutrition issues to food safety to real estate and staffing. He was speaking from Sydney, where he and his restaurant team were going through training.\n\n\"I think about all of these challenges, and to me, it's exciting,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tMEXICO CITY - Mexico's president, taking aim at sugary drinks as a public health issue, is asking Congress to impose a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\nIf the legislature passes the proposed tax, Mexicans would pay an extra peso (7.6 cents) for every liter of soft drinks, sports drinks or sugary beverage they buy.\n\nMexico has the highest rate of [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) of any country with 100 million or more residents, according to a United Nations report issued over the summer, and the incidence of diabetes is soaring, taking 70,000 lives a year.\n\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto included the soda tax in an announcement Sunday night of a sweeping tax overhaul designed to collect more revenue, broaden a social safety net and create what his finance secretary called \"a fairer, simpler and more transparent\" tax code.\n\nThe proposal calls for the tax to be imposed on \"flavored beverages as well as concentrates, powders, syrups, essences or flavor extracts.\" Soft drinks sold at movie theaters would be exempt.\n\nAlejandro Calvillo, head of the consumer watchdog group Consumer Power A.C., hailed the proposal but said the tax, which he said would amount to about 10 percent of the cost of a soda bottle, should be higher to have a greater impact on public health.\n\n\"It's good that there would be a tax. We have to acknowledge that. But to have a significant impact on consumption of sugary drinks, assessments show that it should be a 20 percent tax,\" Calvillo said.\n\nMexico has the world's highest per capita consumption of Coca-Cola Co. beverages, with the average Mexican consuming 728 8-ounce drinks a year in 2011, far above consumption in the United States, where the comparable statistic is 403 similar-sized beverages per year, the company says on its website.\n\nCoca-Cola de Mexico did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nProposals to tax or limit sizes of sugar-sweetened beverages have gained traction in various parts of the world.\n\nFrance, Finland, Algeria and Hungary have all imposed taxes on sugary drinks, and a California state proposal for a penny-per-ounce tax on sodas is under consideration.\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, making public health one of the hallmarks of his tenure, saw his effort to bar restaurants from selling soft drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces shot down in late July by a New York appellate court. Public health experts hailed Bloomberg's campaign against sugary drinks, while critics derided it as part of an over-reaching \"nanny state.\"\n\nOne public health expert said studies show that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in the United States would reduce consumption.\n\n\"A 10 percent increase in the price should result in a 10 to 12 percent decrease in consumption,\" said Roberta R. Friedman, director of public policy at the Yale University Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.\n\nFriedman said soft drink consumption has been linked to higher incidence of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dental disease and gout.\n\nCalvillo said the Mexican government should provide details of how it would spend the 2 billion pesos (about $152 million) likely to be raised by the soda tax. He said some of the money should go toward putting drinking fountains back in schools and public places.\n\n\"High consumption of sugar drinks in the nation is highly linked to the lack of drinking water in public places,\" Calvillo said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Americans are heading South and West again in search of jobs and more affordable housing, as the nation's economic health continues to improve.\n\nCensus population estimates show that the 16 states and the District of Columbia that comprise the South saw an increase of almost 1.4 million people between 2014 and 2015\\\\. The 13 states in the West grew by about 866,000 people.\n\nThe gains represent the largest annual growth in population of the decade for both regions and signal that the multi-decade migration to the Sun Belt has resumed after being interrupted by the Great Recession of 2007-09 and the economic sluggishness and anxiety that followed.\n\nIn comparison, population growth in the Northeast and the Midwest - including what's known as the Snow Belt - remained sluggish, growing by about 258,000 residents combined.\n\n\"Clearly, the Snow Belt-to-Sun Belt migration is coming back after a huge lull in response to the recession and post-recession period,\" said demographer William Frey, of the Brookings Institution. \"Up until now, regional migration was not picking up at the same time that other economic indicators - jobs and housing - seemed to be on the upswing.\"\n\nThe numbers indicate Americans' growing willingness to pick up and go after having sat still earlier in the economically tenuous decade, when the U.S. Census Bureau reported that only 1 in 5 people who wanted to move somewhere else did so.\n\nThe new estimates, released last month, arrive midway through the decade, halfway to the next census, in 2020, and provide some indications of where the nation is headed from the standpoint of governing from Washington.\n\nIf the population shift continues, Texas could gain three new seats in the U.S. House; Florida, two; and Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina and Oregon one apiece after the next census, according to an analysis by Election Data Services, a political consulting firm based in Virginia.\n\nNine states - Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia - could meanwhile lose a seat apiece.\n\nThe shift in population reflects the economic conditions many Americans experience or aspire to.\n\nA search for jobs and more affordable housing were behind two-thirds of the long-distance moves made between 2014 and 2015, according to a separate census report. Family reasons, such as getting married or rejoining relatives, accounted for another quarter of households moving.\n\nTexas, for example - which had the biggest population gain from 2014 to 2015, an increase of 490,000 people for a total 27,469,114 - is a magnet for job-seekers from elsewhere. It has been at the fore in high job growth and has outpaced the nation's economic growth since the recession.\n\nOther Sun Belt states that witnessed a growth in population - such as Georgia and Nevada - also had some of the largest increases in job growth or economic output, as did Colorado, Oregon and Utah.\n\nWest Virginia, meanwhile, suffered a population loss of almost 5,000\\\\. The state, which has relied economically on a declining coal industry, has higher unemployment and lower job growth rates than the national average - giving more people more reasons to leave.\n\n\"As long as the state economy continues to stall, population loss will likely continue as well,\" said Christiadi, a demographer at West Virginia University.\n\nSix other states also had population losses for the year: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico and Vermont. And like West Virginia, many are struggling to provide economic opportunity. New Mexico, Connecticut and Maine had some of the lowest rates of job creation in recent years.\n\nFlorida's gain of almost 366,000 people to a population of 20,271,272 was its largest in a decade and reflects another cause behind the renewed exodus to the Sun Belt: The nation's swollen population of baby boomers now feels more secure economically in picking up and moving to traditional retirement oases.\n\n\"The state continues to attract retiring baby boomers because of our climate and the relatively low costs of living,\" said Richard Doty, a demographer with the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. \"You can sell a home in New York or Ohio or Michigan for substantially more than you would spend in Florida, so it's still relatively attractive.\"\n\nTake, for example, Sumter County, west of Orlando, one of Florida's fastest-growing counties, driven in large part by retirees. It is projected to have a median age of 78 by 2020, Doty said.\n\nA typical Sumter County home costs about $224,000 - or about half the price of a home in a New York City suburb, such as Long Island's Nassau County.\n\nThe influx and exodus of people has ramifications for local housing, tax bases and governments - even within state boundaries.\n\nIn Oregon, where the economy is partly being driven by chip manufacturing for firms like Intel, young people are moving to Portland, said Josh Lehner, an economist at the state's Department of Economic Analysis. That's creating a housing shortage, as construction fails to keep up with demand.\n\nMany of Oregon's newcomers are from neighboring California, which had more than 77,000 people move out. That's more than twice the number who left between 2013 and 2014\\\\. The state showed a net increase in population in 2014-15 of more than 350,000 only as a result of births and new immigrants.\n\nMany left because of housing costs. A typical home in California costs two-thirds more than in Oregon, for example.\n\nThe cost of housing can limit the number of people willing to move into California to take even high-paying, high-tech jobs in places like San Francisco, said John Malson, chief of demographic research at the California Department of Finance.\n\n\"You have a very good job market here in tech, so people who are coming here are coming for the attractive job opportunities,\" Malson said. \"But it's very expensive to live in California.\"\n\nA state's net population growth and loss numbers can sometimes cloud what's going on within its boundaries, meaning that some job-rich urban areas might be flourishing but rural areas might not be.\n\nTake Massachusetts, for example, the fastest-growing state in the Northeast.\n\nSusan Strate, manager of population estimates at the University of Massachusetts' Donahue Institute, said young people from other states and well-educated foreign immigrants are boosting the Boston area's population by taking jobs in medicine, education and biotech.\n\nMeanwhile, she said, \"some of the little towns are losing what few young people they have.\"\n\nIllinois, whose population dropped by 22,000 people to 12,859,995, is another state undergoing a similar trend.\n\nChicago is attracting more businesses and young, educated professionals to fill those jobs, while many less-expensive rural and suburban areas with less economic opportunity struggle, said Rob Paral, a Chicago demographic consultant.\n\nAvailable jobs and a person's ability to fill them, he said, are intertwined with population shifts - within the state, or to the Sun Belt.\n\n\"There are many high-skill jobs overall,\" Paral said. \"Jobs for lower-skill young persons are another story, combined with high housing costs: If you are going to make the same low wage in Illinois or in a Southwestern state, the latter offers cheaper housing and warmer weather.\"'"

            "title": "Skipping college for Wyoming oil fields can be a boom-bust trap",
            "text": "\tCASPER, Wyo. - These are boom times in the resource-rich Cowboy State, courtesy of an oil explosion whose ripples can be felt across the land.\n\nGood-paying blue-collar jobs in the petroleum and natural gas fields are as plentiful as pickups here, and the unemployment rate - 4.6 percent in July - remains far below the 7.4 percent national average.\n\nBut critics worry that the prodigious oil output includes a potential byproduct. Despite such fast-dollar success, heavy reliance on a single industry known for its dramatic downturns could one day help paint the state into a precarious financial corner, they say.\n\nMany fear the day when Wyoming's oil market fails, as it last did in the mid-1980s, exposing a fundamental flaw in the state's job picture: The lure of the oil dollar has prompted teenagers to skip college, or abandon high school, for the petroleum fields - many without a Plan B if things go bust.\n\nThey're young workers like Tyrel Wellmaker, a high school graduate who left the Army for a low-skill petroleum job, albeit one with a salary that outstripped even those of positions that require college educations.\n\nIn his early 20s, wiry and strong, he labored as an oil field roughneck, manning the rigs that dot the region's rolling western landscape. He came home each night dirty and dead tired, but the money more than made up for it: With a six-figure salary, he purchased his own house and drove a snazzy $50,000 pickup.\n\nBut with the boom came Wellmaker's personal bust. He soon grew tired of the dangerous conditions after witnessing fellow workers die on the job. One winter day in 2008, when the toilet in his communal trailer froze solid on a job in North Dakota, he just walked away.\n\nWithout savings, he soon filed for bankruptcy. The house went into foreclosure. Two scowling repo men claimed his prized pickup. At 26, he sheepishly moved back in with his father and regretted his decision to forsake college.\n\n\"I felt I had made the biggest mistake of my life,\" said Wellmaker, now 31.\n\nBut who could blame him? For most U.S. high school graduates, the quickest way to achieve the American dream is to attend college. Not so in Wyoming, where the oil boom has turned the education-to-earning-power paradigm on its head.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, the average salary nationwide for a bachelor-degree holder was $48,997 - nearly twice what a high school graduate made ($26,957) and more than double that of a high school dropout ($19,013), according to Census Bureau figures.\n\nCompare that with Wyoming: In 2011, in the $60,000-$75,000 pay bracket, the number of bachelor-degree holders was outpaced by those with only high school educations.\n\nIn the $38,000-$47,000 bracket, even workers without high school diplomas outnumbered those with college degrees, state economists say.\n\nWyoming's ties to fossil fuels run deep: 70 percent of the state's annual revenue comes from coal, gas and uranium extraction. Some experts say the state must play the hand it was dealt.\n\n\"You have to pursue the opportunity while all those good-paying jobs are there,\" said Mark Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint, who specializes in the energy industry.\n\nHe predicts the oil boom will be long-lived. \"Let's be practical: A college degree is no guarantee to success anymore. Young people should grab some of this oil money. They can always go back to school,\" he said.\n\nCritics say the oil flow has reduced the urgency in Wyoming to diversify its economy and attract white-collar jobs.\n\n\"Wyoming is an energy state; we live off the energy dollar, and people are used to the resulting low taxes,\" said Sissy Goodwin, a power technology instructor at Casper College. \"We're in a boom cycle now, but the bust will come. We need our politicians to look for the non-energy jobs of the future. But they're not doing that.\"\n\nGoodwin already knows many young men who returned to school after being injured in the oil fields. \"I've seen a lot of pricey pickups in the parking lot,\" he said. \"They don't last. The owners can't afford them anymore.\"\n\nAlthough jobs for unskilled workers are plentiful, those for college graduates are not.\n\nLast year, 16.5 percent of Wyoming's 288,000 jobs required a bachelor's degree, according to the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services. By comparison, 67.2 percent - more than two-thirds - required only a high school diploma.\n\nJim Rose, director of the Wyoming Community College Commission, said state residents were almost afraid to consider a future without oil. \"The newest boom has meant extraordinary revenue, and it's been difficult for many, legislators included, to be weaned from that, to say, 'Let's talk about economic diversity,'\" he said.\n\nWyoming has tried to attract new businesses, such as a fledgling high-tech industry, but Rose called the lack of jobs statewide for college graduates \"sobering.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of blame to go around,\" he said. \"Colleges can't train students for a workforce that doesn't exist. If Wyoming started training people to work in the automobile or aircraft industry, we'd just be buying them a ticket to leave the state because there are no jobs here.\"\n\nState Sen. Jim Anderson says officials are encouraging young workers to better manage those oil field salaries. That means fewer luxury homes and man-toys and larger savings.\n\n\"It's all about financial literacy,\" Anderson said. \"These kids should value money so they can save for the education they might need later.\"\n\nOil industry executives don't understand all the hand-wringing. They point to the sprawling Jonah oil and gas field in western Wyoming and the coal and uranium found in the state's Powder River Basin.\n\n\"We've been blessed with mineral resources, and I choose to view that as a positive thing,\" said Cary Brus, a senior vice president at Nerd Gas, a gas and oil exploration company.\n\nHe said industries tied to commodity prices expected fluctuations. \"If there's a downturn, and in this business there always is, workers will be left to figure out where the next paycheck is coming from,\" he said.\n\nBrus has been there. He graduated from college in 1981 and went into oil work. Then came the bust of 1984. \"My job went away,\" he recalled. \"So I went back to graduate school. You just deal with it.\"\n\nJonathan Odlin has been trying to deal with it too. A former Marine who did three tours in Iraq, he took a job in the Wyoming oil fields with a cement company in 2006.\n\nHe had a high school diploma, and the pay was good. But he soon loathed the unpredictable hours chasing the oil.\n\nThen, in 2008, a good friend was cut in half in an industrial accident - after taking Odlin's shift. That's when he called it quits.\n\nOdlin, 30, will soon earn a degree in power plant technology at Casper College, as he struggles to support five children. \"The oil fields may mean quick bucks, but for low-level workers like me, they're not the place to be.

            "title": "Why oil is down by half, what it means for you",
            "text": "\tNEW YORK - The price of oil has fallen by nearly half in just six months, a surprising and steep plunge that has consumers cheering, producers howling and economists wringing their hands over whether this is a good or bad thing.\n\nThe price of a barrel of oil is just under $58, down from a summer high of $107, and lower than at any time since the United States was still in recession in the spring of 2009.\n\nSo what's going on? A global imbalance of supply and demand that is rippling across the world economy, for better and worse.\n\n## Supplies Go Boom\n\nYears of high oil prices, interrupted briefly by the recession, inspired drillers around the world to scour the Earth's crust for more oil.\n\nThey found it.\n\nSince 2008, oil companies in the United States, for example, have increased production 70 percent, or 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. To put that in perspective, that increase alone is more than the production of any OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs U.S. production was ramping up, turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa reduced supplies from Libya, Iran and elsewhere. A balance was struck: Increasing supplies from outside of OPEC and from Iraq's recovering oil industry helped meet rising demand around the world as other OPEC supplies waivered.\n\nBut now those OPEC supplies look more certain despite continuing turmoil, and those non-OPEC supplies have swamped the market. OPEC estimated last week that the world would need 28.9 million barrels of its oil per day next year, the lowest in more than a decade. At the same time, OPEC countries plan to produce 30 million barrels of oil per day next year. That supply surplus is sending global prices lower.\n\n## Demand Goes Bust\n\nGlobal demand is still expected to grow next year, but by far less than many thought earlier this year. The economies of China, Japan and Western Europe - the top oil consumers after the United States - all appear to be weakening. Oil demand falls when economic growth stalls.\n\nThe United States is still the world's largest consumer, but more fuel-efficient cars and changing demographics mean demand for oil and gasoline is not increasing. The Energy Department predicts a slight decrease in gasoline demand next year even though the price is expected to be sharply lower and the economy is expected to grow.\n\n## The Happy Consumers\n\nFor drivers, shippers, airlines and other consumers of fuel, there's nothing not to like about the drop in oil prices.\n\nThe national average gasoline price has fallen for 81 straight days to $2.55 a gallon, its lowest level since October 2009, according to AAA, a car and travel group. It's $1.15 a gallon cheaper than its high for the year, saving U.S. households $100 a month as they shop for holiday presents. \"Any time gas prices go down that is a good thing,\" said Randy Daniels, 30, who was shopping recently at the Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta. \"An extra 20 or 30 bucks in my pocket goes far.\"\n\nDiesel and jet fuel prices have also plunged, helping boost the profits and share prices of airlines and shippers. Heating oil is the cheapest it has been in four years, reducing home heating prices just in time for winter for many in the chilly Northeast.\n\n## The Worried Economists\n\nFalling fuel prices act like a tax cut and help boost consumer spending, which in turn accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. economy. But economists are growing concerned that there are other, more troublesome forces at play.\n\nThe depth of oil's plunge could be a signal that the global economy is struggling even more than economists think. A weak global economy could hurt the U.S. economy by reducing exports, employment and spending, which together could outweigh the economic benefits of cheaper fuel.\n\n## The Producers' Pain\n\nFor oil companies, oil-producing states, and oil-exporting countries, the oil price collapse is painful.\n\nOil companies generally keep producing oil from wells they've already drilled, but lower prices sharply reduce revenue and force them to cut back spending on new exploration projects. BP announced last week it would try to trim $1 billion in spending next year in a move that analysts say could result in thousands of job cuts.\n\nStates that rely on taxes from energy production such as Alaska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas will see lower revenues and some have already had to trim budgets.\n\nMajor oil exporters such as Iran, Iraq, Russia and Venezuela rely heavily on revenue from state-owned oil companies to run their governments and are struggling under major budget shortfalls. For example, Bank of America estimates that every $1 drop in the global price of oil costs Venezuela $770 million in annual revenue. Current prices are now $46 below last year's average, putting the country on pace for a $36 billion reduction in revenue.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - After years of decline, the piano industry might be on the upswing.\n\nIn August, Bob Frazier's company made a move that many people called crazy: It opened a second piano store.\n\nThe industry is dying, he was told. Kids don't have the time or the interest. Shops are folding. Houses are too small. Electronic keyboards are taking over.\n\nHe was bent on proving them wrong. Frazier, the fast-talking, ever-chipper sales manager, along with owners Mark Stanielun and Dan Kastenmeier expanded Heavenly Pianos from Arlington Heights, Illinois, to Winnetka's Hubbard Woods Business District.\n\nNearly a year later, he said, the new store is running smoothly.\n\n\"There's enough families that know the value and benefits of music,\" Frazier said. \"We have actually sold a lot of pianos. The industry is on an upswing. I have no doubt at all that the piano will survive and thrive.\"\n\nAs the housing and stock markets have improved, pianos have experienced a revival. The industry grew 4.3 percent and sold more than 37,200 new acoustic pianos last year in the United States, reversing a three-year trend of atrophy, according to the April 2015 Music Trades report.\n\nThe best year for new piano sales in the U.S. was 1909, when more than 364,500 were sold. In 2005, that number was 95,000, dropping to 33,000 at the height of the recession in 2009, the report said.\n\nMore disposable income has made the uptick in sales possible. Larry Morton, president of Hal Leonard Corp., an educational music print publisher, noted that the sale of new pianos is directly tied to real estate. As housing becomes available and affordable, new homeowners are more likely to buy big-ticket items.\n\n\"The sales of new acoustic pianos, particularly grand pianos, have always been driven by people buying new homes,\" he said. \"It's part of the experience of having a house, not unlike buying furniture, in some ways.\"\n\nThough sales are still well below pre-recession levels, local dealers and tuners find the growth encouraging.\n\n\"If you perceive the glass as half empty, then that's what it will be,\" Frazier said. \"The 2008 recession caused a dip in sales, but it wasn't a free fall. There is still value in this.\"\n\nThe piano industry is not dying, just changing, said Dennis Saphir, former owner of Kurt Saphir Pianos, who recently switched to an online model. He pointed to the glut of used and digital pianos flooding the market, which has cannibalized new piano sales.\n\n\"The business climate has certainly changed,\" Saphir said. \"There was a time when you could make a market strategy and basically see it through for an entire year. You can't do that anymore.\"\n\nDigital piano sales inched up 3.7 percent last year, with 135,257 units sold - nearly 100,000 more than acoustic pianos, according to the Music Trades report.\n\nThe use of eBay and Craigslist has also made buying the instruments cheap and easy, forcing traditional piano stores to switch strategies. Nearly a thousand used pianos are listed for sale on Craigslist Chicago, ranging from an upright piano dating from the 1930s for free to a Yamaha baby grand listed for $10,999.\n\nSaphir shuttered his last showroom in April in favor of an online marketplace. The seventh generation owner of the family business - which started in Vienna, Austria, in the early 1800s - struggled to keep the business afloat after the 2008 economic recession. Five showrooms were gradually pared down to none.\n\nThe website of the \"New Kurt Saphir Piano\" boasts of taking the worry out of buying a used piano. Saphir does appraisals, evaluations, tunings and repairs, as well as being a middleman and listing instruments other people are selling on his website. Customers can peruse the pianos - there are currently 22 on the site - from the comfort of their own home.\n\n\"The industry is faced with figuring out where music lies in homes and getting that right,\" Saphir said. \"There is a tendency for today's generation to feel obligated to introduce their kids to music, but parents don't necessarily want the commitment of a new piano.\"\n\nThe decrease in sales in past years does not correlate with waning interest, Saphir said.\n\nIf anything, public interest in the instrument has grown. Parents enroll their youngsters in lessons, while adults pick up sheet music to fulfill long-held dreams of playing.\n\nMorton said sales of Hal Leonard's level one instruction books have increased consistently from 3 to 8 percent each year over the past five years. The publishing company serves 7,500 music stores across the nation.\n\n\"There's this dichotomy: How can instructional materials go up while piano sales are going down?\" Morton said from Milwaukee, where the company is headquartered. \"The demand is still there, but people are using different kinds of pianos: more used and digital, less brand-new. But the outlook is definitely getting brighter for everyone.\"\n\nMusic instructor Holly Kennedy, 45, who lives in the Chicago area, said more of her clients want to learn piano than any other instrument. She has been teaching piano to students, ranging in age from 4 to 60, for 16 years.\n\n\"There seems to have been a resurgence in interest,\" she said. \"Especially with adults. More people wish they had played piano as a child, and they're finally coming at it from the other end. They have more time and money to put into the hobby.\"\n\nThomas Zoells, who grew up in Switzerland, developed an obsession with the piano in childhood and has never grown out of it. He is widely regarded as one of Chicago's most passionate piano advocates.\n\nHe opened his shop, PianoForte, in a room of the Fine Arts Building and began selling high-end pianos in 2004, shortly before the economic recession. He struggled for years to turn a profit.\n\n\"I started in the business at the worst possible time,\" he said, laughing at the impossibility of it. \"I was rather naive. I literally opened up a business with four pianos and a desk in the back of the room. I learned I needed a better plan.\"\n\nMore than 10 years later, PianoForte is now an 11,700-square-foot, three-floor space. The building has been fashioned as a \"kind of shrine\" to the piano, albeit one designed to rumble continuously with sounds of classical jazz, blues, boogie and just about anything else 88 keys can express.\n\nOn the first-floor showroom, Zoells sells Faziolis, imported from Italy with a hefty price tag of $100,000. The for-profit business underwrites the not-for-profit PianoForte Foundation, which presents concerts, broadcasts, lectures, film screenings and funds scholarships.\n\nBusiness has been steady, Zoells said.\n\n\"The interest is pretty high,\" he said. \"There has been a rebound in the last few months in the piano industry, and we have been staying busy. There's a very physical experience in playing piano and making music. This is a center for people who are interested in all things piano.\"\n\nZoells said he has faith that people will continue falling in love with the piano.\n\n\"There's a lot of reasons to be negative,\" Zoells said. \"But we do this because we think we can somehow turn the ship around. I think we already are.\"'"

            "text": "\t### PRO: Restaurant workers fighting for the vast underpaid majority\n\nWASHINGTON - Walkouts and protests by fast-food workers demanding higher wages and collective bargaining rights began last November and spread to 60 cities nationwide at the end of August.\n\nIt is an inspiring grass-roots movement led by some of the nation's most underpaid employees, and should be supported by everyone who has a sense of fairness.\n\nFirst let's dispense with some of the nonsense that people have been told about these workers: they are not mostly teenagers.\n\nAs my colleagues John Schmitt and Janelle Jones have shown, the majority are at least 23 and only 30 percent are teenagers. More than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.\n\nHow are they supposed to survive on about $9 an hour - their average wage - with many making the current [federal minimum](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) of just $7.25?\n\nObviously, they are not just there temporarily before advancing to higher-paying jobs with benefits: our deformed economy is not producing enough decent jobs to which they could move. In fact, nearly half of employed college graduates say that their jobs do not require a college degree.\n\nFast-food workers are suffering for the same reasons that the majority of employees have lost ground for decades: the rules of the economy have been rewritten against them.\n\nIt is not primarily \"technological change\" or \"skills mismatches\" that have caused the richest 1 percent of Americans to double their share of total income from 10 percent in 1980 to 20 percent in 2011. It is because the link between productivity growth - increasing output per employee - and wage growth has been broken. If even the federal minimum wage had increased with productivity and inflation since 1968 - as it had done in prior decades - it would be $17 per hour today instead of a meager $7.25.\n\nThe broken link between productivity and wages is due to the fact that most workers have lost bargaining power. And that is a result of deliberate \"reforms,\" including:\n\nThe weakening of labor unions through changes in and non-enforcement of labor law;\n\nInternational \"trade\" agreements that put most workers but not higher-paid professionals into more serious competition with lower-wage labor abroad;\n\nAnd many other policy changes that redistribute income upward.\n\nThe result of these structural changes is an economy that has depended increasingly on consumer indebtedness and bubble-driven growth _ especially the huge stock market bubble of late '90s and the real estate bubble that followed after 2002. The collapse of the real estate bubble, which caused the Great Recession and the weak recovery since mid-2009, has further undermined workers' bargaining power.\n\nThe organization and collective action of fast-food workers, like that of the \"Occupy Wall Street\" movement, is another indication that the right-wing and neoliberal economic experiment of nearly 40 years has run its course. This kind of mass organizing around domestic economic issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nPresident Obama supports a higher minimum-wage but unfortunately didn't deliver on his campaign promise to push for the Employee Free Choice Act, which would go a long way to restoring workers' rights to form unions and bargain collectively.\n\nObama and his allies were just defeated in their efforts to drag the country into another military conflict, because Americans showed the Congress that they were sick and tired of senseless wars, and those who voted for another one would be held accountable. Maybe we should make these politicians understand that we are also sick and tired of an economy that delivers the goods to fewer and richer people each year, and leaves tens of millions of people struggling to get by. Then we might begin to reverse some of the wrongs here at home too.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n> Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

Far from improving their condition, it left them worse off. Raising the wages of fast-food workers to $15 an hour would produce similar results for those the proposal is intended to help.\n\nIn America, minimum-wage workers are better paid than the average worker in Mexico. Why? It's not because U.S. employers are more generous than their Mexican counterparts. Nor do Americans somehow deserve better pay.\n\nAmerican minimum-wage earners make more because they produce more. Better education and greater capital investment make American workers more productive, raising their earnings.\n\nCompetition forces businesses to pay workers according to their productivity. If companies pay less, their employees will jump ship to competitors. And if they pay workers more than they produce, they go out of business.\n\nFor better or worse, fast-food jobs are relatively low-productivity positions, typically filled by inexperienced workers. Most fast-food customers want a quick, inexpensive meal. They will not regularly pay premium prices for a burger and fries.\n\nDoubling McDonalds' wages would raise their total costs by 25 percent _ well above profit margins. But raising prices would drive customers away.\n\nIf Congress mandated fast-food restaurants to pay $15 an hour, they would have to change operations to deliver the kind of productivity to justify those higher costs. That would mean replacing current workers with machines and hiring fewer, more skilled workers to maintain them.\n\nRestaurants could do this in a variety of ways, such as using iPad kiosks instead of cashiers to take orders, or installing the new robotic burger flipper that makes up to 400 hamburgers an hour.\n\nAt current wages these high-tech investments make sense for only a few restaurants; if wages doubled they would become widespread. The end result: far fewer jobs in the fast-food industry and higher pay for those who remain.\n\nThose who consider such a trade-off worthwhile miss the economic role of minimum-wage jobs. For most workers, they are entry-level positions where they can gain experience that makes them more productive and helps them command higher pay in their next job.\n\nBusinesses value skills like reliability, discipline and the ability to accept instructions. Fast-food jobs instill these basic skills in inexperienced workers.\n\nMost Americans started out in a job paying within a dollar of the minimum wage. Few stay there long. The average fast-food employee stays at his or her restaurant for less than a year. These are simply gateway jobs, the first step on a career ladder. That is why the vast majority of fast-food workers are under the age of 25.\n\nSuper-sizing fast-food wages would eliminate many of these entry-level positions, making it harder for young people to land that all-important first job and start climbing the ladder of success.\n\nMost policymakers recognize this. Not even the most liberal state has a minimum wage anywhere near $15 an hour. But American Samoa offers a case study of would happen if the \"living wage\" lobby prevailed.\n\nThe island territory used to have a separate minimum wage because of its lower incomes. However, in 2007, Congress applied the U.S. minimum wage to Samoa. For the tiny Pacific Ocean nation this was the economic equivalent of $20 an hour.\n\nIt did not boost purchasing power, stimulate demand or raise living standards. Instead unemployment septupled to more than 35 percent.\n\nThe Samoan economy collapsed. The islands' governor begged Congress to suspend the wage hikes, pleading: \"Our job market is being torched. Our businesses are being depressed. Our hope for growth has been driven away ... How much does our government expect us to suffer?\"\n\nGood intentions do not repeal the laws of economics. Requiring dramatically higher fast-food wages would eliminate hundreds of thousands of entry level jobs. This would no more help fast food workers than bleeding them with leeches.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n> James Sherk is a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation. \\nThis essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

            "title": "Opinion: Wasting food in a hungry world",
            "text": "\tOTTAWA, Canada - One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year, owing to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and wastage in the kitchen. Halve that waste, and the world could feed an extra billion people - and make hunger yesterday's problem.\n\nThe extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). According to the FAO, 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year. One in every 9 people on the planet - 795 million in all - still goes to sleep hungry.\n\nOf course, there has also been remarkable progress: over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people, and - for all the 57 failures - the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate. But the challenge is to sustain the progress: by 2050, demand for food will have nearly doubled. One reason is that by then the world will have added another 2 billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class.\n\nAt the moment, the United Nations is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (hunger is one target area, among many). These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria.\n\nMy think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good - and which will not. Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet - but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world.\n\nIn the rich world, the focus is on food wasted by the consumer. This makes sense: more than half of the rich world's losses take place in its kitchens (basically because we can afford it).\n\nIn Britain, for example, the greatest waste is in salads, vegetables and fruits - luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world. Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person, because it is harder to put everything to use, while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra \"just to be on the safe side.\"\n\nBy contrast, the world's hungry poor waste very little, simply because they cannot afford to. In Africa, daily food waste averages 500 calories per person - but consumers account for only 5 percent of this loss. More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, in inefficient agriculture, because birds and rats eat crops during harvest, for example, or pests spoil grain stores.\n\nThere are many remedies for this kind of waste - from the \"curing\" of roots and tubers to minimize damage, to more expensive refrigeration. So why aren't these technologies - widely used in richer countries - adopted in the developing world?\n\nThe answer is a lack of infrastructure. If there are no proper roads linking fields to markets, farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce, which may then spoil before it can be eaten. Improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers - and fertilizer and other agricultural inputs to reach farmers. Supplying reliable electricity permits grains to be dried and vegetables to be kept cool.\n\nEconomists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving post-harvest losses in the developing world would be $239 billion over the next 15 years - and would generate benefits worth more than $3 trillion, or $13 of social benefits for every dollar spent.\n\nThis would make food more affordable for the poor. By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people - more than the current population of South Africa - would no longer be at risk of hunger, and that about 4 million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition. Most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the world's most deprived regions.\n\nBut there is an even better investment. We can achieve three times the economic benefits, and even larger reductions in the number of people at risk of hunger, if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses.\n\nToday, only $5 billion is spent annually on research to improve the seven major global food crops, and just one-tenth of that is targeted to help small farmers in Africa and Asia. Investing an extra $88 billion in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4 percent each year.\n\nThat might not sound like very much, but the reduction in prices and improvements in food security would help almost everyone. It would be worth nearly $3 trillion in social good - yielding an enormous $34 of benefits for every dollar spent.\n\nHunger is a complex problem, exacerbated by financial pressures, volatile commodity prices, natural disasters and civil wars. But we could take an enormous step toward winning the global campaign against malnutrition, simply by investing in improved infrastructure and in agricultural research and development.'"

            "text": "\tLONDON - Want to sell that masterpiece for a fortune? It might help if it's red.\n\nThat's just one trend from an art market that has come roaring back from the global financial crisis, with buyers from emerging markets such as China molding tastes and driving top-end prices ever higher.\n\nSales next week at London's Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses are expected to generate at least 400 million pounds ($658 million) amid an insatiable global appetite for works by [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso), Matisse and other modern masters.\n\nSotheby's put its works on public display in London Thursday, and there was a distinct scarlet hue to the star lots - Gerhard Richter's cadmium-colored abstract \"Wall,\" expected to sell for at least 15 million pounds; an Andy Warhol portrait of Chairman Mao valued at 5 million pounds to 7 million pounds; a vivid red piece in molten plastic by Alberto Burri that could break the 3-million-pound record for the Italian artist.\n\n\"When we're pricing things we're aware of the power of red,\" said Alex Branczik, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department in London.\n\n\"Red is a color that incites passion. It's the color of the sunset, it's the color of blood,\" he said. \"I think it's more primal than nationality, but I do think it has a special resonance for Asian buyers,\" for whom red may have associations with luck and happiness.\n\nThere is some evidence to support this theory - four of the five most expensive Richters ever sold are red. Sotheby's says there's a chance \"Wall\" could smash expectations and beat the $37.1 million record for a living painter.\n\nBuyers from Asia, and especially China, are one reason the art market has rebounded from the global financial crisis of 2008.\n\nNewly affluent Chinese collectors began by buying works from their own country - both modern art and historic treasures - before moving into European contemporary art and other areas.\n\nSotheby's estimates that China now accounts for $14 billion of the $58 billion global art market. Asian buyers spent twice as much on contemporary artworks at the auction house in 2013 as they did the year before.\n\nArt spending by Latin Americans also leapt last year, while Russian and Middle Eastern collectors continue to pay record prices.\n\n\"When I started in this industry, it was really European and American (buyers),\" said Jay Vincze, head of Christie's Impressionist and modern department. \"Now it is truly global.\n\n\"The market is strong,\" he said. \"The buyers are out there.\"\n\nThat has led to a mood of quiet optimism at the auction houses.\n\nIn sales of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art starting Feb. 4, Christie's has Pablo Picasso's \"Woman in a Turkish Costume,\" a portrait of his wife and muse Jacqueline Roque - estimated at up to 20 million pounds - and Juan Gris' Cubist \"Still Life with Checked Tablecloth,\" valued at up to 18 million pounds.\n\nThere are also multimillion-dollar works by Piet Mondrian, Rene Magritte, Fernand Leger and Joan Miro.\n\n\"When you look around these rooms, the supply we've got this season is incredibly rich and varied,\" Vincze said Thursday. \"The quality is very, very high.\"\n\nA few blocks away at Sotheby's, sales that start Feb. 5 include Vincent Van Gogh's \"Man is at Sea,\" once owned by actor Errol Flynn; Lucian Freud's portrait \"Head on a Green Sofa\"; and works by Claude Monet, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse.\n\nAnother highlight is Camille Pissarro's 1897 \"Boulevard Monmartre,\" which Sotheby's calls \"one of the most important Impressionist paintings we've handled.\" It's estimated at 7 to 10 million pounds, but there's a feeling it could fetch more.\n\nIt's a far cry from the jittery years after the 2008 banking crisis, when works went unsold or reached lackluster prices.\n\nAuctioneers are already looking to woo the next wave of wealthy art buyers. Christie's held its first sale in India last month, and Sotheby's opens an exhibition of Indian and international art in New Delhi on Friday.\n\nAnd, said Branczik, \"I think Central Asia is interesting. It's a place where a lot of wealth is being generated.\"'"

Another way to look at it: Each of the wealthiest 85 has access to the same resources as do about 42 million of the world's poor, a number equal to the populations of Canada, Kentucky and Kansas, taken together.\n\nThe report was issued just before The World Economic Forum opens on Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland. The forum is a gathering spot for world political, academic and business leaders where, the forum's website says, they \"shape global, regional and industry agendas.\"\n\nIn announcing the study, Oxfam's website said that what it sees as the growing wealth gap undermines democracy.\n\n\"The past quarter of a century has seen wealth become ever more concentrated in the hands of fewer people,\" it said. \"The wealth of the 1 percent richest people in the world amounts to $110 trillion.

The very wealthiest people on Earth collected 95 percent of the post-crisis growth, the report said.\n\nThe report said that the trend is more pronounced in the United States than in other nations, but hardly limited to the U.S. It said that in only two countries, Colombia and the Netherlands, had the share of income received by the wealthiest 1 percent not increased between 1980 and 2012.\n\nIn the United States, China and Portugal, the report said, the wealthiest 1 percent had seen its share of income more than double in the same period.\n\n\"To give an indication of the scale of wealth concentration, the combined wealth of Europe's 10 richest people exceeds the total cost of stimulus measures implemented across the European Union between 2008 and 2010,\" it said.\n\nOxfam urged countries to take steps to make certain policies didn't make the situation worse. \"When there is growth and diminishing inequality, the rules governing markets are working in favor of the middle classes and the poorest sections of society,\" the report said. \"However, when only the rich are gaining, the rules start bending towards their interests exclusively.\"'"

            "text": "\tLONDON - Time was when being queen (or king) meant having the power to make your enemies' heads roll. Now it means being told by upstart lawmakers to cut your expenses and chop the number of people on staff. And could Your Majesty please do a better job of keeping your home in decent condition?\n\nIn a report released Tuesday on the finances of Britain's royal household, members of Parliament criticized the state of disrepair of much of Queen Elizabeth II's considerable estate, saying that nearly 40 percent of it was in subpar condition. The boiler in Buckingham Palace hasn't been overhauled in 60 years and buckets catch water leaking from the roof inside a gallery where priceless artworks are kept, one lawmaker said.\n\nYet even as urgent home repairs were needed, the world's most famous extended family spent $74.5 million in 2012-13, going over budget by $3.8 million. The number of people serving them remains unchanged from several years ago. And the household's rainy-day reserve fund has dwindled to a decidedly less-than-princely sum of $1.7 million.\n\nOne way to help rectify that, Parliament's spending watchdog committee said, would be for the queen's financial advisers to show a little more business savvy - for example, by throwing open the doors of Buckingham Palace to ticket-buying lookie-loos for more of the year than just the summer months to which such visits are currently limited.\n\n\"I don't think they've been rigorous enough or commercial enough in their approach to ensure that we really eke out best value for every pound of taxpayers' money that is spent supporting the royal household and serving the queen,\" the committee's chairwoman, Margaret Hodge of the Labor Party, told Sky News. \"We think a more commercial approach ... could raise more income.\"\n\nAs for staffing, lawmakers said the royal household should learn to live with fewer underlings, just as government agencies have been forced to lay off workers during five years of the most brutal austerity cuts Britain has seen in a generation.\n\n\"More could be done to reduce expenditure,\" the report said. \"In recent years, public-sector organizations have managed to reduce spending while being expected to maintain or improve the services they provide.\"\n\nAt the same time, the committee urged the royal household to \"get a much firmer grip\" on the repairs that are needed to keep properties such as Windsor Castle in running order. Such a huge backlog has built up that no one knows how much it would cost to deal with all of it.\n\nThe royals are not alone in drawing criticism from Hodge's committee, which has also taken Google, Amazon and other multinational corporations to task, accusing them of pursuing tax-avoidance schemes.\n\nA statement from the palace said that the royal household has undertaken important maintenance jobs.\n\n\"Recent examples of work include the renewal of a lead roof over the Royal Library at Windsor and the removal of asbestos from the basement of Buckingham Palace,\" the statement said. \"The need for property maintenance is continually assessed.\"\n\nAlthough most Britons support the monarchy, its cost to them as taxpayers sometimes comes in for critical scrutiny, particularly when times are tough. In 1992, with public anger rising over various royal scandals, Elizabeth, who is one of the world's richest women, volunteered to pay tax on her enormous fortune for the first time.\n\nA few years ago, as austerity began to kick in, the queen pinched pennies (which all have her face on them) by freezing some staff salaries and paring back on some official travel.\n\nHowever, she still received a publicly funded \"sovereign grant\" of $51.5 million in 2012-13, an amount that is set to rise to $62.9 million in 2014-15.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Russian retaliatory sanctions announced this week against U.S. and European agricultural products are minuscule in the grand scheme of global trade but are hardly paltry for poultry producers in the Carolinas and across the South to Texas.\n\nThe sanctions against more than $1 billion in annual U.S. farm exports to Russia pale compared with the isolation many Russian energy and financial firms are now feeling in the wake of a blacklisting by both Europe and the United States.\n\nYet Russia's actions in response carry some bite, whether it's on salmon roe exports from Washington state or on almonds and pistachios grown in California. It's especially true for chicken and turkey raised or slaughtered in the Carolinas, Mississippi and Texas.\n\n\"Fortunately, Russia is not as significant to us as an industry as they were,\" said Mike Cockrell, chief financial officer for Sanderson Farms, a large poultry producer and exporter with operations in North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana and in its home state of Mississippi. \"In 2008 they represented about 20 percent of our industry's exports.\"\n\nThat's not to say Russian sales are inconsequential. Sanderson Farms shipped 87.5 million pounds of product there last year, worth about $40 million.\n\n\"Forty million dollars is certainly a lot of money, but at the end of the day we and the industry will seek out alternative markets for our product,\" said Cockrell, noting that the $40 million represents about 1.5 percent of his company's total sales.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corp., headquartered in Greeley, Colorado, is also a major poultry exporter, doing business with 105 countries. But it was mum Thursday on the impact of Russia's sanctions.\n\n\"We are not providing any comment at this time,\" said Rosemary Geelan, a spokeswoman. Pilgrim's Pride operates in Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nTyson Foods is another major poultry and meat exporter to Russia. Its website notes that Russia accounted for 3 percent of all its chicken exports in fiscal 2012 and 9 percent of its pork exports.\n\n\"We don't report export volumes for specific counties,\" said Worth Sparkman, a company spokesman, adding that \"we're disappointed about the loss of the Russian market but don't expect the impact to be significant since the volume we ship there can be absorbed by other global markets.\"\n\nAfter the U.S. and the European Union ratcheted up sanctions against Russia last month, retaliation was expected. Sanderson's sales force actively sought new markets for dark chicken and turkey meat for weeks before Wednesday's announced retaliation.\n\n\"You don't find alternative markets for 87.5 million pounds of chicken overnight. It will take us some time to do that,\" Cockrell acknowledged, adding, \"We've done a pretty good job diversifying our exports.\"\n\nSanderson Farms exports some product from a facility in Kingston, North Carolina, but most of its exports originate at deboning plants in Waco, Texas, Hammond, Louisiana, and operations in the Mississippi cities of Laurel, Collins and Hazelhurst. The company is shopping potential sites for a new plant near Fayetteville, North Carolina, which will be more export focused. Much of its chicken exports now go through the Port of New Orleans.\n\nAbout 3 percent of the exports moving through South Carolina ports, namely Charleston, are bound for Russia. Food and agriculture products account for about 12 percent of all the cargo bound for Russia, according to data crunched for McClatchy by the South Carolina Ports Association. South Carolina ports last year moved about 1,800 20-foot containers of food and agriculture products to Russia.\n\nGeorgia's Port of Savannah also handles a large volume of poultry exports.\n\n\"We are monitoring the trade embargo to Russia very closely. The primary export ag commodities that move through our ports to Russia is poultry and peanuts, very important markets for the state of Georgia,\" said Curtis Foltz, executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority. \"The sanctions have just been announced and our customers are evaluating the impacts to Russia and any opportunities in alternative markets.\"\n\nThe Russian ban on poultry is not a first. U.S. poultry was banned during the Bush administration in 2003 and 2004 when Russia objected to trade penalties levied against Russian steel. Poultry was again targeted briefly in 2010.\n\nWhile an inconvenience for U.S. exporters, the poultry sanctions ultimately hurt the Russian consumer. Russian poultry is more expensive because the country has to import feed, and U.S. producers enjoy numerous cost advantages.\n\n\"We don't sell chicken to Putin. We sell chicken to Russian consumers, and they are going to be the ones that suffer from this,\" predicted Cockrell. \"If that's what Putin wants to do, it's his consumers suffering as a result.\"\n\nThe United States chose not to impose sanctions that could hurt ordinary Russians, so Russia's announcement Wednesday carried some irony.\n\n\"What the Russians have done here is essentially to impose sanctions on their own people,\" David Cohen, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a call with reporters.\n\nRussia's government is limiting access to food, a move, said Cohen, \"that the U.S. and our allies would never do.\"\n\nThe checkered history of Russia using poultry imports as a political weapon spurred other U.S. poultry companies to steer clear of that market.\n\n\"It was just such an up-and-down market,\" said Mitch Mitchell, vice president of sales for Case Farms in Morganton, North Carolina, which had already decided to avoid Russia. \"We just got tired of the roller coaster.\"\n\nCase Farms exports about 10 percent of its product, mainly to South Korea, China and elsewhere in Asia. A protracted cutoff of Russia could lead to lower profits from poultry exports, he warned, if companies are all courting the same buyers for U.S. chicken.'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE - Fifty years after the U.S. Surgeon General first warned of the health effects of smoking, a new analysis from the University of Washington shows that the number of smokers worldwide - and the number of cigarettes consumed - has never been higher.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2012, the number of adults who smoke increased from 721 million to nearly 1 billion, reports the study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The number of cigarettes smoked globally jumped from about 5 trillion to 6.25 trillion.\n\nThe study, which is one of the most comprehensive ever to examine global tobacco use, shows that the remarkable reductions in smoking rates in the United States and other wealthy countries have been offset by a growing epidemic in the developing world.\n\n\"The University of Washington study demonstrated clearly how much further the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries, still has to go,\" said Matthew Myers, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\nThe rise in the number of smokers reflects both population growth - particularly in nations such as China and Indonesia - and the tobacco industry's heavy marketing in poorer nations, experts say.\n\nSmoking statistics are usually reported in terms of rates - or the percentage of people who smoke. The UW analysis confirmed that the global smoking rate dropped from 26 percent to 18.7 percent during the study period.\n\nBut the sheer number of smokers is most relevant when it comes to the public- health impact, said Ruth Malone, who studies global tobacco issuesat the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\"It's premature deaths ... and the total global burden of suffering - of preventable suffering - that we're talking about here,\" said Malone, who was not involved in the UW analysis.\n\nAfter dropping rapidly for a decade, global smoking rates have declined more slowly since the mid-2000s, said Marie Ng, lead author of the analysis from the UW's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). And though the data are still uncertain, the analysis hints that the worldwide smoking rate for men may have started to climb in the past three years.\n\nSince the surgeon general's 1964 report drew a clear link between smoking and lung cancer and other diseases, tobacco-control efforts in the U.S. have saved 8 million lives, according to another JAMA study. The fraction of Americans who smoke has fallen by more than half, from 42 percent in 1964 to 18 percent in 2012.\n\nAnd despite population growth, the number of smokers in the U.S. has also dropped, from 52 million in 1980 to 38 million in 2012.\n\n\"Tobacco control has been described, accurately, as one of the great public-health successes of the 20th century,\" U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden wrote in an editorial accompanying the studies.\n\nBut lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women. The World Health Organization estimates tobacco-related illness kills 5\\xc3\\xa2\\xc2\\x80\\xc2\\x89million people a year worldwide - more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.\n\nNg and her colleagues spent three years compiling and analyzing more than 1,000 data sets from 182 countries. An online visualization tool prepared by IHME allows anyone to parse the results by country, sex, age and other variables.\n\nThose details reveal that countries with effective tobacco-control programs have all seen dramatic declines in tobacco use, Myers said.\n\nUruguay, which was the first nation to adopt a set of WHO-recommended policies, such as higher cigarette taxes and restrictions on advertising, saw smoking rates plummet 25 percent in just three years.\n\nSince 1980, the smoking rate in Mexico, which requires graphic warning labels on cigarette packages, has fallen faster than in the U.S. But countries such as Russia, Indonesia and China, where up to 54 percent of men still smoke, have slowed global progress, Myers said.\n\nRussia, however, recently adopted some of the world's toughest anti-smoking measures, which will kick in soon.\n\n\"This study is not a reason for a sense of hopelessness,\" Myers said. \"It is, however, a clarion call that in those countries that have not yet implemented tobacco-control policies, the death toll from tobacco is going to be devastating.\"'"

            "title": "Invasive lionfish threaten Gulf of Mexico ecosystem",
            "text": "\tGALVESTON, Texas - It sounds like something from a horror film: A beautiful, feathery-looking species of fish with venomous spines and a voracious appetite sweeps into the Gulf of Mexico, gobbling up everything in its path.\n\nUnfortunately for the native fish and invertebrates it's eating, this invasion isn't unfolding on the big screen.\n\nIn recent months, news has been spreading of lionfish, a maroon-and-white striped native of the South Pacific that first showed up off the coast of southern Florida in 1985. Most likely, someone dumped a few out of a home fish tank. With a reproduction rate that would put rabbits to shame and no predators to slow its march, the fish swept up the Eastern seaboard and down to the Bahamas and beyond, where it is now more common than in its home waters.\n\n\"The invasive lionfish have been nearly a perfect predator,\" says Martha Klitzkie, director of operations at the nonprofit Reef Environmental Education Foundation, or REEF, headquartered in Key Largo, Florida. \"Because they are such an effective predator, they're moving into new areas and, when they get settled, the population increases pretty quickly.\"\n\nThe lionfish population exploded in the Florida Keys and the Bahamas between 2004 and 2010. As lionfish populations boomed, the number of native prey fish dropped. According to a 2012 study by Oregon State University, native prey fish populations along nine reefs in the Bahamas fell an average of 65 percent in just two years.\n\nLionfish first appeared in the western Gulf of Mexico in 2010; scientists spotted them in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, a protected area about 100 miles off the Texas coast, in 2011. Now scuba divers spot them on coral heads nearly every time they explore a reef. So far, significant declines in native fish populations haven't occurred here, but the future is uncertain.\n\n\"It's kind of this impossible battle,\" says Michelle Johnston, a research specialist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Galveston, who manages a coral reef monitoring project at the Flower Garden Banks. \"When you think how many are out there, I don't think eradication is possible now.\"\n\n---\n\nLionfish are fascinating, beautiful creatures. Two nearly identical species are found in the Gulf. They grow to about 18 inches and have numerous venomous spines. Their stripes are unique, like those of a zebra. They hover in the water, hanging near coral heads or underwater structures where reef fish flourish. Ambush predators, they wait for prey fish to draw near, then gulp them down in a flash.\n\nThe fish mature in a year and can spawn every four days, pumping out 2 million eggs a year. They live about 15 years.\n\nIn the South Pacific, predators and parasites keep lionfish in check. But here, nothing recognizes them as food - those feathery spines serve as do-not-touch warnings to other fish. The few groupers that have been spotted taste-testing lionfish have spit them back out, Johnston says.\n\nIn the basement of the NOAA Fisheries Science Center on the grounds of the old Fort Crockett in Galveston, Johnston sorts through a rack of glass vials. Each one contains the contents found in the stomach of a lionfish collected in the Flower Garden Banks.\n\nShe points to a fish called a bluehead wrasse in one jar. \"This little guy should still be on the reef eating algae, not here in a tube,\" she says. Other jars contain brown chromis, red night shrimp, cocoa damselfish and mantis shrimp, all native species found in lionfish bellies. \"The amount of fish we find in their guts - it's really alarming. They're eating juvenile fish that should be growing up. They're also eating fish that the native species are supposed to be eating.\"\n\nLionfish can eat anything that fits into their mouth, even fish half their own size. They eat commercially important species, such as snapper and grouper, and the fish that those species eat, too. They're eating so much, in fact, that scientists say some are suffering from a typically human problem - obesity. \"We're finding them with copious amount of fat - white, blubbery fat,\" Johnston says.\n\nThey can adapt to almost any habitat, living anywhere from a mangrove in 1 foot of water to a reef 1,000 feet deep. They like crevices and hidy-holes but can find that on anything from a coral head to a drilling platform to a sunken ship. They can handle a wide range of salinity levels, too. Their range seems limited only by temperature - so far they don't seem to overwinter farther north than Cape Hatteras, North Carolina - and their southern expansion extends to the northern tip of South America, although they are expected to reach the middle of Argentina in another year or two.\n\n\"As long as they have something to eat, they'll be there,\" Johnston says.\n\nThe impacts of their invasion could become widespread, scientists warn.\n\nIn the Gulf, lionfish are eating herbivores like damselfish and wrasse - \"the lawnmowers of the reef,\" Johnston calls them - that keep the reef clean. \"When you take the reef fish away, there's not a lot of other things left to eat algae,\" she says. That creates a phase shift from a coral-dominated habitat to an algae-dominated one. \"When you take fish away, coral gets smothered, the reef dies, and we lose larger fish. It's a snowball effect of negativity.\"\n\nShe lifts the lid of a huge freezer. Dozens of frozen lionfish faces peer out. Another rack of vials contains clippings from lionfish fins. Scientists use the parts for analysis, so they can determine species and gene flow.\n\n\"They're a beautiful fish, and I always feel a little bad when I remove one,\" Johnston says. \"But to remove one and dissect it and see the fish in its gut that should have been on the reef, I don't feel so bad. They're invasive and do damage and shouldn't be here - they should be in the South Pacific.\"\n\n---\n\nThe only known way to keep lionfish populations in check here, scientists say, is human removal.\n\nScientists don't want to bring in another non-native fish to eat lionfish, for fear of creating another invasive species problem, and sterilization programs cost too much and are not logistically feasible, Johnston says.\n\nThat's why lionfish \"derbies,\" or fishing tournaments of sorts, are popping up around the Caribbean and Gulf. Locals are encouraged to kill and gather the fish, and in some places, including Belize, cook them up afterward.\n\nA recent study, also by Oregon State University, found that native fish populations in the Bahamas grew by 50 percent to 70 percent on reefs that are regularly culled for lionfish. On reefs where they're not culled, though, native fish populations decreased by an average of 50 percent. That seems to indicate that safe havens can be created where native species can recover.\n\n\"We're never going to be able to eradicate lionfish, but there is a level where the population can be controlled and impacts can be limited,\" says Klitzkie of REEF.\n\nREEF has hosted a series of six lionfish derbies in southern Florida and the Bahamas. Participants have collectively removed more than 12,000 lionfish since the series started in 2009. \"We've found they're really making an impact on lionfish population,\" Klitzkie says.\n\nIn the Gulf, researchers like Johnston have special permits that allow them to remove lionfish when they spot them in the Flower Garden Banks sanctuary, but they need help. And that takes divers, boats and money. \"It's really an uphill battle ... in times of limited budget, it can seem dismal,\" Johnston says. \"The second you stop, they come back.\"\n\nThe Flower Garden Banks sanctuary recently landed a $20,000 grant for lionfish research from the Texas State Aquarium. The money will be used to train local divers to safely collect and remove lionfish from localized habitats in the Gulf. An invitational roundup is planned at the Flower Gardens Banks in September, too.\n\nTexas anglers can take all the lionfish they want outside the Flower Garden Banks using spears, nets or hook and line, as long as they have a fishing permit. Inside the sanctuary, only hook and line is allowed, but that's not very effective because lionfish usually stalk and eat live prey whole.\n\nAnother key to lionfish population control? Getting people to understand that lionfish are safe to eat - and tasty.\n\nThat word is slowly spreading. At least one Texas restaurant - the raw bar Cove, inside the Houston restaurant Haven - regularly puts lionfish on the menu.\n\nJean-Philippe Gaston, the chef at Cove, said some of the restaurant's regular customers, who are scuba divers, alerted him to the lionfish problem in 2011. Haven hosted a lionfish dinner to get the word out. When Cove opened in 2012, it became a menu staple there.\n\n\"We serve it every day,\" Gaston says. \"A lot of people come in just for it.\"\n\nThe fish is flaky and mild tasting, not fishy, and takes on the flavor of whatever seasoning it is prepared with, he says. It can be fried, poached, served raw, encrusted in peanuts, wrapped in leaves and steamed or marinated in coconut milk with lemongrass, jalapenos, orange segments and ginger, just for starters. To prepare it, though, the cook has to snip off the spines before fileting it. (Two instructional videos are posted on the REEF website at www.reef.org/programs/exotic/lionfish/resources.)\n\nBut for now, it's an expensive fish for most restaurants to carry. That's because the fish are usually spear-caught, and they're difficult to handle. An accidental puncture causes swelling and localized pain. (If you're stung, immerse the wound in hot water to break down the proteins in the venom.)\n\nA market might be developing, though. In Florida, local lobstermen are catching lionfish in their lobster traps and making more money selling the fish than the crustaceans, according to Klitzkie. The organization publishes a lionfish cookbook that features about 100 recipes, from bacon-wrapped lionfish filets to fritters, ceviche, cakes and tacos made from the invasive species.\n\nA gourmet appetite for lionfish would be good news for the Gulf.\n\n\"Order it,\" Johnston says, tapping on the tank of the office's resident lionfish mascot, a golf ball-sized fish named Woodstock. \"It's the greenest fish you can get.\"'"

            "title": "Some antibacterials come with worrisome silver lining",
            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Silver has long been known for its ability to kill some of the nasty microbes that can make people sick. In hospitals, it's used to help burn victims, to combat germs on catheters and even to wipe out dangerous \"superbugs\" that have grown resistant to traditional antibiotics.\n\nNow, capitalizing on consumers' fear of germs, companies are adding tiny, powerful silver particles to cutting boards, underwear, yoga mats, running shirts, socks and an expanding array of other \"antibacterial\" goods.\n\nSuch products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and incorporate it into various materials. (A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.)\n\nBut some scientists and environmental watchdog groups say putting nanosilver to widespread use may pose risks, as no one knows how chronic exposure to the particles may affect human health or the ecosystem in the long run.\n\nThey also worry that silver may lose its power to fight infections if bacteria become more resistant, a phenomenon already seen with other antibiotic drugs and with triclosan, an ingredient added to antibacterial soaps, cosmetics and other commercial goods.\n\n\"Some humans are quite frightened of bacteria, and the tendency to overuse silver is likely,\" said Samuel Luoma, an emeritus researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey and the author of \"Silver Nanotechnologies and the Environment,\" a report published by the Pew Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies.\n\n\"What concerns me is the explosion of products which we don't know are effective and that are not necessary,\" Luoma said. \"It's important to prove it's worth taking the risk before we put it in the environment.\"\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began requiring manufacturers of nanosilver to register their products, saying the particles could pose different risks than conventional silver. But critics, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, say the agency's process is flawed because it allows the products to be sold commercially several years before safety studies are completed.\n\nConsumers, meanwhile, often can't tell whether products contain nano-sized silver because nanomaterials aren't required to be labeled.\n\n\"The presence of nanotechnology in consumer products has gone underground,\" said Emma Fauss, who in 2008 compiled an inventory of commercial nanotechnology products for the Pew project. \"Manufacturers shy away from labeling things in their products unless it's trendy. There's a perception that if it's labeled, it could be dangerous.\"\n\nSilver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which are lethal to bacteria and yeast. Ancient civilizations used the metal to treat open wounds, and American pioneers tossed silver coins into water storage barrels to keep water fresh.\n\nNanoparticles of silver, which can occur naturally, are more powerful than bigger particles because their large surface area relative to their mass increases the number of ions released.\n\nThe silver industry says concerns about nanosilver are unfounded, pointing to silver's history as an effective antibiotic agent and noting that most applications use very small quantities.\n\nIt also says nano-sized silver isn't new and has been in continual use for more than a century. Nanoscale silver products have been safely used in swimming pools and drinking water purification since the 1970s, said Rosalind Volpe, executive director of the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group.\n\n\"It's the most sustainable and by now the most researched and safest biocide technology on the market,\" said Carlo Centonze, CEO of the Swiss company HeiQ, which produces nano-sized silver, primarily for use in medical products.\n\nSome manufacturers also argue that treating textiles with silver nanoparticles benefits the environment by reducing the need for washing, allowing cleaning at lower temperatures and making the products more durable.\n\nIn general, experts agree that humans can safely tolerate fairly high doses of silver. What's new is that over the past decade nanoparticles have been manipulated and put in places where silver has never been before.\n\nSome scientists and environmental health groups fear that the very properties that make these particles useful - their vanishingly small size and high surface area - may have unintended consequences once they get into the human body and the environment.\n\nBoth animal studies and computer models have found that nanoparticles, including nanosilver, can spread throughout the body into organs and tissues.\n\n\"Nanoparticles are little bundles of pure metal that can dissolve within the body if taken up as a particle,\" said Luoma.\n\n\"To me,\" he added, \"the big risk is to ingest or breathe nanosilver when we don't know for sure if there's a unique risk in this form.\"\n\nLike other germ-killers, including antibiotics, nanosilver also could upset the delicate balance of bacteria inside the digestive tract, said Marina Quadros, associate director of the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology. \"Under the right conditions, silver nanoparticles are very effective in killing bacteria, both the good and the bad,\" she said.\n\nBeyond the possible impact of nanosilver on human health, environmental concerns loom large.\n\n\"There is clear evidence that silver, and in particular nanosilver, is toxic to aquatic and terrestrial organisms\" and to cells from mammals in laboratory research, the EPA stated in a 2010 report.\n\nPotential sources of nanosilver pollution include landfills, wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities. Several lab studies also have found that nanosilver can leach out of products when washed.\n\n\"If we start using tons of silver nanoparticles and a lot more are going down the drain, then we might start to have an effect we haven't seen in the past,\" said Amy Pruden, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who is investigating whether silver nanoparticles in waste streams can stimulate antibiotic resistance in microbes.\n\nSome studies have found that nanosilver in wastewater tends to be transformed into silver sulfide, a much less toxic substance, said Mark Wiesner, director of the Center for the Environmental Implications of Technology at Duke University.\n\nResearchers there also found that the vast majority of nanosilver that enters a wastewater treatment center is removed from the water as it sticks to bacteria that feed off organic matter.\n\nBut these bacteria, Pruden said, eventually settle out to form biosolids, or \"sludge,\" that is applied as fertilizer to agricultural land. Nanosilver in the sludge could affect the soil bacteria responsible for cycling nitrogen and carbon, she said.\n\nPesticides, which include chemicals that kill bacteria, must be registered with the EPA before they can be sold or distributed. But until recently, the agency did not consider nanosilver to be different from regular silver. That allowed a variety of nanosilver products to enter the market based on the toxicity data for conventional silver.\n\nThe EPA now reviews nano-sized silver separately, recognizing that nano-sized particles have different characteristics and may have different effects on human and environmental health. Since 2011, the agency has \"conditionally approved\" two pesticide products containing nanosilver as the active ingredient.\n\nEnvironmental health organizations complain that the conditional approval process allows products to be marketed several years before all the safety studies have been submitted, potentially putting consumers at risk.\n\nLast year, the Government Accountability Office reported that the EPA couldn't reliably or systematically track how many products had been conditionally registered or whether the safety studies were submitted. In its response, the EPA said it was working to improve its oversight, including designing an automated data system.\n\nFor consumers, the safety picture on nanosilver is murky to say the least. Products launched before the change in EPA rules remain on the market, and little information is available on how much silver a product contains and what size it might be.\n\nWhen the European Commission tried to investigate the safety, health and environmental effects of nanosilver, it had difficulty reaching any conclusions.\n\n\"A specific human risk assessment for silver nanoparticles is not feasible as information on possible long-term effects are lacking,\" its report stated.\n\nUntil such data are collected, some argue that nanosilver shouldn't be used in consumer products, in part to preserve silver's ability to fight infections.\n\nGermany's risk management agency cited that reason in arguing that silver should not be used as an antimicrobial ingredient on a large scale, with the exception of medical applications.\n\n\"Silver was and continues to be a valuable tool,\" said Andrew Maynard, director of the University of Michigan Risk Center. \"There is a real fear that if we are indiscriminate with use, we could accelerate resistance.\"\n\nBut Maynard also said people may have taken the assumption of harm too far, in the absence of more concrete evidence. Using nanosilver in a product may make sense if it serves a medical purpose and proves effective, he said.\n\n\"Rather than a marketing ploy, it should be something that will benefit people,\" Maynard said. \"We've survived for many years without having antimicrobial shirts and tools.\"'"

            "text": "\tNASA's newest robotic explorer rocketed into space late Friday in an unprecedented moonshot from Virginia that dazzled sky watchers along the East Coast.\n\nBut the LADEE spacecraft quickly ran into equipment trouble, and while NASA assured everyone early Saturday that the lunar probe was safe and on a perfect track for the moon, officials acknowledged the problem needs to be resolved in the next two to three weeks.\n\nS. Peter Worden, director of NASA's Ames Research Center in California, which developed the spacecraft, told reporters he's confident everything will be working properly in the next few days.\n\nLADEE's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft, which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage, Worden said. But the computer automatically shut the wheels down, apparently because of excess current. He speculated the wheels may have been running a little fast.\n\nWorden stressed there is no rush to \"get these bugs ironed out.\"\n\nThe LADEE spacecraft, which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust, soared aboard an unmanned Minotaur rocket a little before midnight from Virginia's Eastern Shore.\n\n\"Godspeed on your journey to the moon, LADEE,\" Launch Control said. Flight controllers applauded and exchanged high-fives following the successful launch. \"We are headed to the moon!\" NASA said in a tweet.\n\nIt was a change of venue for NASA, which normally launches moon missions from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But it provided a rare light show along the East Coast for those blessed with clear skies.\n\nNASA urged sky watchers to share their launch pictures through the website Flickr, and the photos and sighting reports quickly poured in from New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, New Jersey, Rhode Island, eastern Pennsylvania and Virginia, among other places.\n\nThe Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer or LADEE, pronounced \"LA'-dee,\" is taking a roundabout path to the moon, making three huge laps around Earth before getting close enough to pop into lunar orbit.\n\nUnlike the quick three-day Apollo flights to the moon, LADEE will need a full month to reach Earth's closest neighbor. An Air Force Minotaur V rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., provided the ride from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.\n\nLADEE, which is the size of a small car, is expected to reach the moon on Oct. 6.\n\nScientists want to learn the composition of the moon's ever-so-delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time. Another puzzle, dating back decades, is whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface.\n\nThe $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for LADEE.\n\nThe 844-pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay. NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices.\n\n\"There's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system, certainly to Mars,\" that laser communications will be needed to send high-definition and 3-D video, said NASA's science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nIt was a momentous night for Wallops, which was making its first deep-space liftoff. All of its previous launches were confined to Earth orbit.\n\n\"It was just a beautiful evening,\" Grunsfeld said.\n\nNASA chose Wallops for LADEE because of the Minotaur V rocket, comprised of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors belonging to the Air Force. A U.S.-Russian treaty limits the number of launch sites because of the missile parts.\n\nAll but one of NASA's previous moon missions since 1959, including the manned Apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s, originated from Cape Canaveral. The most recent were the twin Grail spacecraft launched almost exactly two years ago. The military-NASA Clementine rocketed away from Southern California in 1994.\n\nWallops will be back in the spotlight in less than two weeks. The Virginia-based Orbital Sciences will make its first delivery to the International Space Station, using its own Antares rocket and Cygnus capsule. That commercial launch is scheduled for Sept. 17.'"

            "title": "In Navajo country, coal gives life \u2001Eand takes it, some say",
            "text": "\tFRUITLAND, N.M. - From her bedroom window, Cynthia Dixon watches the cloud of soot rise from the coal mine near her sheep spread. Down the road, a hulking coal-fired electrical plant spews a yellow plume that stains the horizon.\n\nMany days, she finds a layer of black dust coating the inside of her trailer home. Farmers who have worked the land for decades say fouled air from the mine and nearby Four Corners coal-fired power plant has shriveled fruits and vegetables in the field. And there are fewer eagles and jack rabbits, which once thrived on the Navajo Reservation, they add.\n\nIn the last two years, the air, Dixon suspects, has killed 38 of her 56 sheep. She found the last two - a lamb and a ewe - a few months ago. But it's not just her animals who are suffering: The Navajo elder often gasps for breath from the soot, she says.\n\nFour Corners is one of the oldest coal-fired power plants in the U.S. Owned and operated on leased Navajo land by Arizona Public Service, it sits near the San Juan Generating Station, another coal-fired plant just off the reservation here in northwestern New Mexico.\n\nTogether, the facilities are the country's two largest plant emitters of nitrogen oxide, which can affect breathing in high concentrations, according to a study by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Scientists found the plants are at the threshold of the Environmental Protection Agency's standards for clean air, but possible changes to the standards could soon put the facilities over the legal limit.\n\nAs the facilities rumble around the clock to light homes in faraway Phoenix and elsewhere, tens of thousands of Navajo - as well as the residents of such communities as Farmington, New Mexico - inhabit a realm that environmentalists call the energy garbage dump of the American West.\n\nNobody knows whether the power plants are making people sick, but their presence continues to divide tribal members. Some residents blame particulates from Four Corners for high rates of asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis and bitterly criticize the hundreds of Navajo who work at the plant.\n\nTribal activists want the Navajo leadership to move beyond coal and invest in cleaner technologies such as solar and wind power. But officials insist the tribe needs Four Corners because it generates $40 million in annual taxes and royalties - a sizable portion of the tribe's operating budget.\n\nIn recent years, Four Corners has improved its air quality. In 2010, the EPA ordered a cleanup; this year, Arizona Public Service closed three of the facility's five emit stacks and is retrofitting the remaining two to cut emissions of nitrogen oxide by at least 30 percent, plant officials say.\n\nBut activists want more: They say there has never been a study that directly examines the health effects of Four Corners emissions. A 2010 study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that coal and wood burning inside homes on the reservation caused breathing difficulties, but the study never looked at the effects of Four Corners particulates, study officials acknowledge.\n\nTribal leaders regularly monitor particulates from the plants, often asking residents and schools to call tribal offices with complaints. Windy days are the worst.\n\nDixon, 59, uses a propane heater in her tiny trailer. She dreads the onset of winter, when the inversion layer holds power plant emissions closer to the ground, where they cloud the sun and do their damage. She wants to leave. \"But where can I go?\" she asks.\n\n---\n\nTribal activist Sarah White motions toward Four Corners. The 65-year-old, who has asthma, is convinced that pollution from the plant is ruining her health: \"I can just imagine what I'm breathing in.\"\n\nHer suspicions led her to speak out on a reservation she says was once known not for air pollution but for its star-filled night skies and majestic stone edifice known as Shiprock.\n\nWhite joined a small but determined Navajo group called Dine Citizens Against Ruining our Environment (CARE). Members have doggedly lobbied the tribal government to end its economic dependence on coal. They stand up at tribal board meetings with pointed questions, rallying residents to elect new leaders who are not beholden to coal interests.\n\nGoing door to door, they gather petitions to draw attention to high tribal sickness rates. In 2006, Dine CARE members teamed up with the San Juan Citizens Alliance to file suit against the federal government to examine the direct health effects of both the Navajo mine and Four Corners.\n\nThis year, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining released a draft environmental impact report saying improvements were being made at Four Corners, and estimating the chance of getting cancer near the plant as one in a million.\n\nActivists say a comprehensive government study of Four Corners has yet to be done.\n\n\"People think we should be happy about the closure of those three stacks, but we're not. It's like drinking 15 ounces of Drano instead of 20,\" said Mike Eisenfeld, New Mexico energy coordinator for the San Juan Citizens Alliance.\n\nNavajo leaders insist the plant and coal mine are crucial to the Navajo economy because they provide 800 jobs in an area where unemployment often tops 50 percent.\n\nThey recently extended the utility's lease at Four Corners until 2041 and purchased the mine near Dixon's ranch that supplies coal to Four Corners - moves they insist help guarantee the tribe's future.\n\nStephen Etsitty, executive director of the tribe's Environmental Protection Agency, empathizes with residents. \"I tell people their issues are real,\" he said. \"Four Corners plays a role in the community's health, but there are other factors too.\"\n\nSuch as plant salaries exceeding $55,000 a year. \"On the reservation, that salary puts you squarely in the upper middle class,\" he said. \"That's tough to give up.\"\n\nDavid Hansen, vice president of fossil generation at Arizona Public Service, called the plant's operation \"good for the Navajo Nation, good for the environment and good for our customers.\"\n\nIn his book \"Fire on the Plateau,\" Charles Wilkinson, a public land law scholar at the University of Colorado Law School, details how the shadow of big coal emerged here during the 1960s, when urban consumers across the Southwest sought cheap power without having to deal directly with the environmental downside of coal factories.\n\nThey found it on the Navajo's 27,000-square-mile reservation covering parts of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, among \"people too few and powerless to resist,\" Wilkinson wrote. The U.S. government cut backroom deals with coal, oil and gas companies on behalf of tribal councils, which quickly formed to ease the extraction of resources, he asserted.\n\n\"It was a water and power grab of the highest order,\" Wilkinson said. \"The Navajo were a sovereign nation in name only. The U.S. government just told tribal leaders to 'sign here.' Most of the electricity was designed to leave the reservation.\"\n\nDixon said sheep ranchers were driven from their land by the burgeoning development and graveyards were hastily relocated in the frenzied search for more coal to feed the power plants.\n\nThe year 2005 galvanized activists. That's when members of Dine, which means \"the people\" in Navajo, helped defeat a tribal proposal to build a third coal-fired plant known as Desert Rock.\n\nWhite and her daughter, Victoria Gutierrez, still drive the reservation's back roads to convince Navajo plant workers that good salaries aren't worth their health.\n\n\"One plant welder told me that the money is good,\" Gutierrez said, \"but he knows he'll die early from the pollution particles, which he said were like shimmering pieces of glass suspended in the air.\"\n\n---\n\nNavajo farmer Joe Allen has watched over the years as his watermelons shrank to the size of a human fist, his corn stalks stunted to just knee-high. He blames the coal dust.\n\nAllen recently took a stand against the power company: Utility officials had erected a gate to block access to a road used by its lumbering trucks. It kept Allen from getting to a small family cemetery. The plant already rules the sky over his head, he said; now officials want the land beneath his feet as well.\n\nOne evening, he confronted a Four Corners security guard, a fellow Navajo, threatening to ram the gate with his truck. He asked how one Navajo could do this to another. Then, his voice breaking, he shouted toward the plant's two remaining emission towers: \"The soot from those two black lungs is killing all of us.\"\n\nPlant guards let Allen through. As the light faded, a small procession eased down a dusty dirt road and the Navajo men walked to the graveyard, tending to the earthen mounds of their ancestors.\n\nJust over a hill, Four Corners and its smokestacks loomed in the distance.'"

            "title": "Ancient DNA coded from early human, creating new mystery",
            "text": "\tPeering far deeper than ever before into humanity's murky genetic past, scientists sequenced the DNA of an ancient European relative and found a puzzling connection to the Far East.\n\nThe genetic sample came from a 400,000-year-old thigh bone pulled from the cold, damp depths of a Spanish cave called Sima de los Huesos, or \"Pit of Bones.\" Researchers surmised that it belonged to an extinct species of hominin known as Homo heidelbergensis, a direct ancestor of Neanderthals, and they expected it to resemble DNA extracted from of a handful of Neanderthal bones found in Spain, Croatia and other sites in Europe.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n\"This really raises more questions than it answers really,\" said biologist Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, a pioneer in the quest to decode ancient DNA. \"It's a big surprise.\"\n\nPaabo and his colleagues published a report on their findings this past week in the journal Nature.\n\nThe DNA is the oldest known genetic material ever recovered from an early human, beating the previous record by roughly 300,000 years. It was taken from cell mitochondria, tiny structures that produce energy for the cell. It contains far less information than DNA from a cell nucleus, but it decays more slowly and is easier to study in ancient specimens.\n\nMitochondrial DNA is passed down virtually unchanged from mothers to children. Therefore, if the mystery leg bone belonged to an ancestor of Neanderthals, it should have been quite similar.\n\nInstead, the gene sleuths discovered a much closer match with the Denisovans, a little-known group of Neanderthal relatives that lived thousands of miles away in Siberia.\n\nThe study's authors, however, remain at a loss to explain the link between an early European hominin and another population in Asia.\n\nOne possibility is that the bone belonged to a member of a group that was ancestral to both Neanderthals and Denisovans and that Neanderthals acquired different mitochondrial DNA after the two groups diverged.\n\n\"Another alternative is that this ancestral group actually interbred with something much older, something like Homo erectus, and obtained its mitochondrial DNA from them,\" Paabo said.\n\nModern humans, or Homo sapiens, are not the descendants of Neanderthals or Denisovans, although they did live as contemporaries at one time and interbred, according to scientists. At some point about 30,000 years ago, all other species of the Homo genus became extinct, leaving only us.\n\nAnswers to this evolutionary mystery may emerge if the team is able to recover nuclear DNA from cells in the femur. Paabo said scientists are already working on it, and they hope to have some results in roughly a year.\n\nBut success isn't something that scientists can take for granted.\n\nAncient genetic information has been extremely difficult to sequence, for at least two reasons. First, DNA strands disintegrate into smaller and smaller pieces over time, making it tricky to determine their original order.\n\nThe second issue is one of contamination. DNA from archaeologists and lab workers can get mixed up with the sample, confusing analysis.\n\nOlder DNA samples have been obtained for other animals - scientists recently sequenced the genome of a 700,000-year-old horse - but those specimens are usually found in permafrost conditions, far from early human remains.\n\nIn the case of the Spanish femur, cool, moist conditions within the cave, as well as rapid advancements in genetic sequencing techniques, allowed Paabo's team to decode much of the mitochondrial genome. Alongside the femur were the remains of 28 other individuals, according to the report in Nature.\n\nFossil remains of European Neanderthals have allowed scientists to describe their appearance in detail. This is not the case with Denisovans, however - evidence of their existence is based only on a fragment of bone from a child's finger and two teeth that were discovered in 2010 in the Altai Mountains of Siberia.\n\n\"We know quite well what Neanderthals look like. They were quite more robust than modern humans . . . more muscular and probably more adapted to living in a harsh northerly climate,\" Paabo said. \"What's fascinating about the Denisovans is we know next to nothing about how they looked. We have their genome and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge. . . . The only thing we can say is they must have been very big, or at least have big mouths.\"\n\nConfusion aside, the sequencing feat has been hailed by scientists as an incredible leap forward - albeit into the past.\n\n\"This is positively exciting,\" said Andrea Manica, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge in England. \"This really pushes back the time horizon of human evolution that we can explore with genetics.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - If a magnitude-9.0 earthquake were to strike along California's sparsely populated North Coast, it would have a catastrophic ripple effect.\n\nA giant tsunami created by the quake would wash away coastal towns, destroy U.S. 101 and cause $70 billion in damage over a large swath of the Pacific coast. More than 100 bridges would be lost, power lines toppled and coastal towns isolated. Residents would have as few as 15 minutes' notice to flee to higher ground, and as many as 10,000 would perish.\n\nScientists last year published this grim scenario for a massive rupture along the Cascadia fault system, which runs 700 miles off shore from Northern California to Vancouver Island.\n\nThe Cascadia subduction zone is less known than the San Andreas fault, which scientists have long predicted will produce The Big One. But in recent years, scientists have come to believe that the Cascadia is far more dangerous than originally believed and have been giving the system more attention.\n\nThe Cascadia begins at a geologically treacherous area where three tectonic plates are pushing against each other. The intersection has produced the two largest earthquakes in California in the last decade - Sunday's 6.8 temblor off Eureka and a 7.2 quake off Crescent City in 2005. The area has produced six quakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater in the last 100 years, the California Geological Survey said.\n\nOfficials in Northern California as well as Oregon and Washington are beginning to address the dangers.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tsunami researchers are testing a new generation of tsunami detectors off the Oregon coast, which could provide earlier warnings about the incoming wave's size.\n\nDuring the 2011 Japan tsunami, some of the first detailed alerts underestimated the size of the tsunami to be lower than the sea walls - and then communications were cut off.\n\n\"So some people had a false sense of security,\" said Vasily Titov, director of NOAA's Center for Tsunami Research. \"You want to have this information as accurate as possible.\"\n\nInstalling tsunami sensors on the deep ocean floor would provide better information on the tsunami's size in as little as five minutes. It now takes about half an hour.\n\nTitov said two underwater test sensors off the Oregon coast seemed to perform well in Sunday's earthquake, though the quake did not produce a tsunami.\n\nIn Grays Harbor County in Washington state, crews will begin building an elementary school gym this summer to double as a \"vertical evacuation center\" - built so that 1,000 people can flee to the roof during a tsunami, protected by a high wall.\n\n\"We have no natural high ground,\" said Ocosta School District Superintendent Paula Akerlund. \"So we have to evacuate vertically.\"\n\nWashington state and federal officials have also been discussing building about 50 \"tsunami safe havens,\" such as artificial hills that could hold as many as 800 people.\n\nThe 2011 Japan tsunami as well as other natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina have fueled efforts to better prepare for a major quake on the Cascadia fault.\n\n\"Katrina was a worst-case scenario for hurricanes in the gulf. And a Cascadia would be the worst-case scenario for tsunamis on the West Coast,\" said Paul Whitmore, director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska.\n\nFor years, scientists believed the largest earthquake the area could produce was magnitude 7.5. But scientists now say the Cascadia was the site of a magnitude-9 earthquake more than 300 years ago.\n\nRipping over a fault that stretches in the Pacific Ocean from the coast of Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, the quake on the evening of Jan. 26, 1700, was so powerful, entire sections of the Pacific coastline dropped by as much as 5 feet, allowing the ocean to rush in and leave behind dead trees by the shore.\n\nThe tsunami reached Japan, destroying homes and rice paddies along the eastern shore.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, Native American stories told of \"how the prairie became ocean,\" and how canoes were flung into trees. Whitmore of the National Tsunami Warning Center said similar waves, up to 100 feet above sea level, could again inundate many areas of the U.S. West Coast.\n\nThe Cascadia fault is powerful for two reasons: It is both extremely long and it is a \"megathrust\" fault, in which two tectonic plates - slabs of rock roughly the size of New Mexico floating atop the Earth's molten core - are being forced underneath the gigantic North American plate.\n\nAs the smaller plates - the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates - jam underneath the North American plate, friction builds, and the edge of the North American plate is temporarily dragged down as well.\n\nBut the North American plate is old and strong, and won't be pulled down forever.\n\nEvery several hundred years or so, the North American plate violently snaps back like a rubber band - thrusting upward with horrific power.\n\nSunday's quake, which erupted 50 miles off the coast, caused light to moderate shaking. No injuries or damages were reported.\n\nAs for the next 9.0 quake, U.S. Geological Survey seismologist David Oppenheimer said: \"It could be today. It could be 100 years from now.'"

            "title": "On the Wicomico River, the last stand for Maryland's nutria",
            "text": "\tWICOMICO RIVER, Md. - On the wall of the nutria eradication team's drab office at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, there's a large whiteboard with names and numbers on it. They're bets for a long-running pool: How many nutria will the team find in the marshes of the Wicomico River?\n\n\"The people that guessed 90, 70, 120, they've already lost,\" says Stephen Kendrot as he drives along a Wicomico County, Md., back road.\n\nIt's an overcast April afternoon with a long-awaited bit of warmth in the air. The nutria project leader is coming back from a site in Quantico, Md.,where four of his trappers are roaming the Wicomico River in jon boats. They've killed about 120 nutria there so far and found a few more this particular morning.\n\nThe river is the site of the final battle in the long-running quest to eradicate the beaver-like rodents (\"nutria\" means \"otter\" in Spanish) that have destroyed thousands of acres of the state's wetlands over the past 40 years. It has taken longer than expected - news articles profiled the waning fight in 2011 - but finally, the state is almost free of the invasive rodents.\n\nLed by Kendrot, the project, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services, has cleared marshes up and down the Delmarva Peninsula over the last 12 years. On the Wicomico River, Kendrot's team is after the last surviving colony.\n\nThe critters feed on the roots and tubers of marsh plants, cutting up the root mat, a fibrous layer that holds the marsh together. Water can then flush in and out with the tide, eroding the root mat. The marsh begins to sink. Eventually, the wetlands turn to ponds.\n\nThe open water has little value to fish and wildlife that rely on the wetlands, and it can't support vegetation that could provide new habitats.\n\nAdditionally, marshes serve as filters that keep pollutants from draining to the bay and even trap some carbon dioxide, said Doug Myers, Maryland senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, one of the non-governmental organizations that support the project.\n\nNot only does marsh loss eliminate these benefits and destroy habitat and food sources, it also leaves the marsh more vulnerable to other factors, including sea level rise, saltwater intrusion, land subsidence and groundwater withdrawal, Kendrot said.\n\n\"A marsh without nutria is somewhat resilient to all these other factors, but with nutria it doesn't stand a chance,\" he said.\n\nThe wetlands in the Chesapeake region have experienced more marsh loss than most other wetlands around the world, Kendrot said, and a study in the 1990s proved that, even with other contributing factors, nutria were largely responsible.\n\nThe semi-aquatic critters, Kendrot describes them as \"a 20-pound rat with a scaly tail and buck teeth,\" were brought to the United States from South America in the 1940s for the fur trade. They have established colonies in states throughout the Southeast and Pacific Northwest. In Louisiana, the nutria population reached 20 million in 20 years, creating a problem that is now too large for eradication.\n\nThe race against nutria in Maryland has cost between $16 million and $17 million to date; the project receives between $1.3 million and $1.5 million a year, federal money funneled through the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nComing into its 14th year, the nutria project has received substantial attention in the United States and around the world. Kendrot, who's hosted delegations from Israel, China and South Korea, among others, said visitors come from all over to learn about the team's techniques in the hopes of implementing similar programs in their areas.\n\nResearch for a nutria project began in the mid-1990s, the program was launched in 2000, and eradication began as an experimental pilot program in 2002. By 2010, the team was confident it could actually wipe the species from the Maryland landscape.\n\nTheir strategy combines more traditional population management techniques with geographic information systems, GPS and mapping technology that Kendrot says sets the program apart. They have pioneered various detection techniques that help them track, trap and kill the nutria, and collected a huge amount of data on the creatures. Catches go back to the shop, where specialists mine the carcasses for information like age, sex and pregnancies.\n\nDetecting the nutria is the biggest challenge, Kendrot said - to figure out both where they are and where they aren't. The latter is key to eventually achieving eradication.\n\n\"How do you go about proving nutria don't exist? It's kind of like proving Bigfoot doesn't exist,\" Kendrot said.\n\nDuring the first year of trapping on the peninsula, the team caught 5,000 nutria at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and in adjacent private lands, Kendrot said. Today, it's been two and a half years since a \"nute\" was spotted at the refuge.\n\nThe trappers have moved down the coast over the years to cover Fishing Bay, the Nanticoke River, southern Dorchester County, Ellis Bay, Monie Bay, Deal Island and the Choptank River.\n\nTo date, the team has killed more than 13,000 nutria in Maryland, deeming 216,201 acres of the Delmarva Peninsula nutria-free with 11,357 acres to go. Half of the peninsula's 500,000 acres was clear of nutria from the start.\n\nDelmarva, which is bordered by the Chesapeake Bay, is \"ground zero\" for nutria, where they were first introduced in Maryland. Nine of its major watersheds were infested with nutria at the start of the project, Kendrot said.\n\nCombing the dense marshes for the elusive animals is a big job for a 10-man staff, and their observations can only provide snapshots, so the team must be vigilant, Kendrot said. After they think they've eradicated nutria in an area, they begin a verification and monitoring stage to make sure the critters don't return.\n\nThere are probably between 200 and 500 nutria remaining in the area, Kendrot said. They don't expect to catch the last one, but rather to get the population so low that the remaining few die off.\n\nThe team estimates that it can catch about 95 percent of nutria in a given area within four weeks, but the last 5 percent can take just as long as the first 95.\n\n\"When it gets down to the last, it gets more interesting. More challenging,\" said Richard Elzey Sr. who has been a wildlife specialist with the project since 2002.\n\nThe team will finish initial trapping by the end of 2014, but they won't declare the state officially eradicated until 2017, after a period of surveillance to make sure new nutes don't sneak in.\n\nBut the team's true focus is on what happens after they leave the marsh.\n\n\"You can't measure the efficacy of eradication by how many critters you kill. It's what you leave behind that determines your success,\" Kendrot said.\n\nIn some areas, like two sites on the Choptank River and in Somerset County, Md.,the marsh recovered completely after the USDA team removed the nutria there, Kendrot said. But there are other places that can never fully recover.\n\nAt Blackwater Refuge, the last nutria was caught in December 2011. But the marsh, which was once so dense you could walk across it at low tide, is filled with water.\n\n\"Much of this marsh was lost by the '70s and '80s, so a lot of people that visit today don't even make the connection that this isn't a healthy ecosystem, it's not what it should be (or) certainly what it used to be. They just see a beautiful lake with some geese swimming out in it,\" Kendrot said.\n\nIn 2003, the Blackwater Refuge partnered with the Army Corps of Engineers and Baltimore's National Aquarium, among others, to restore parts of the refuge, but it cost $300,000 for just six acres. There isn't funding to restore the more than 5,000 acres of marsh that have been converted to open water, Kendrot said.\n\nElzey, who grew up near Blackwater and has watched its marshes disappear over the course of his life, said he wished the project had started in the 1970s. He trapped nutria when they were first introduced on the Delmarva Peninsula.\n\n\"I remember when it was just a creek running through. All marsh. All marsh, and I tracked it all,\" he said.\n\nSome animal cruelty groups oppose the eradication of invasive species, but there has been relatively little opposition to the nutria project compared to similar programs, Kendrot said.\n\nThough the environment is more important than the nutria, the Bay Foundation's Myers said he wished the dead animals didn't go to waste.\n\n\"There are lots of good uses for nutria, including the meat and the furs and we would probably prefer that that happen as opposed to just allowing them to go, because we think they're cute and cuddly,\" Myers said.\n\nBut there is no market for nutria fur or meat, Kendrot said, as places like Louisiana learned when they tried to start up a commercial nutria meat market (though there are plenty of recipes available online for curious hunters). Production costs would be high and Wildlife Services couldn't ensure the safety of the meat for human consumption, anyway, he said.\n\nKendrot said the line of work is controversial but justified when considered in an environmental context.\n\n\"It's a hard leap for some people to make. How can killing animals be considered conservation? But the project isn't to kill nutria. It's to save the marsh,\" Kendrot said.\n\nOn the Wicomico River, Elzey and the rest of the team have been trapping for a month. They're in what they call the knockdown phase: searching for nutes and tracks, looking for catches and setting new traps daily.\n\nThe wildlife specialists spend eight to 10 hours a day on the water. In the dead of winter, this sometimes means working with wind howling across a frozen marsh. In the summer, mosquitoes and gnats buzz about in the humid air. Dead nutria often ride with them in the bottom of the boat while the men finish checking the traps.\n\n\"If you like doin' it, then it don't bother you,\" Elzey said. \"You've gotta love to do it to do the job.\"\n\nIt takes a certain kind of person to do the project, Kendrot said. Though he's an avid hunter, he said he has mixed feelings on whether or not killing the animals ever bothers him, saying he doesn't \"like to demonize the critter.\"\n\nHe names admiration and gratitude as emotions that characterize his relationship with nutes, and he clearly believes in the work he's doing.\n\n\"You know, a lot of people spend their life trying to do something that has a real tangible outcome and obvious impact on the environment or whatever, leave a legacy, and never get that opportunity, and this one's been dropped in my lap so to speak, and it's, you know - if we're successful we'll have achieved something pretty remarkable,\" he said.'"

            "title": "Obama to order major expansion of ocean sanctuary in Pacific",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON-President Barack Obama announced a series of measures Tuesday to protect parts of the world's oceans, including the creation of a marine sanctuary that would close a large swath of the central Pacific to fishing and energy development.\n\nThe plan would require federal agencies to take multiple initiatives to address pollution, overfishing and acidification of ocean water, which is driven by [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).\n\n\"Rising levels of carbon dioxide are causing our oceans to acidify. Pollution endangers marine life. Overfishing threatens whole species,\" Obama said in televised statement to an international conference on ocean policy hosted by the State Department in Washington.\n\n\"If we ignore these problems, if we drain our oceans of their resources, we won't just be squandering one of humanity's greatest treasures. We'll be cutting off one of the world's major sources of food and economic growth, including for the United States.\"\n\nThe announcement provides further evidence of Obama's willingness to use his executive authority to advance priorities in the face of congressional stalemate, and it quickly drew criticism from congressional Republicans, who contend the administration overregulates natural resources industries and that the president has overreached his constitutional powers.\n\n\"This is yet another example of how an imperial president is intent on taking unilateral action, behind closed doors, to impose new regulations and layers of restrictive red-tape,\" said House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash. \"Oceans, like our federal lands, are intended to be multiple-use and open for a wide range of economic activities that includes fishing, recreation, conservation, and energy production.\"\n\nAmong the ocean plan's most ambitious and controversial steps would be the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument southwest of Hawaii. In January 2009, President George W. Bush gave monument status to nearly 87,000 square miles around Howland, Baker, and Jarvis Islands; Johnston, Wake, and Palmyra Atolls; and Kingman Reef. The islands are uninhabited, and the area is one the few pristine stretches of marine environment in the world and home to thousands of migratory birds, fish and mammals.\n\nThe Obama plan envisions extending monument protection from the current limit of 50 nautical miles around the islands to 200 miles, thereby limiting fishing and energy development over a far larger expanse of ocean. The proposal could more than double the area of ocean protected by the United States, environmental groups said.\n\nThe expanded protections, which under federal law the president can order without congressional approval, could go into effect this year after a public comment period.\n\nJoshua S. Reichert, executive vice president of the Pew Charitable Trusts, said he expected considerable resistance to the expansion plan from the domestic tuna industry. But he said Pew estimates that about 1 percent to 3 percent of the U.S. annual tuna catch would be affected by the plan if it went forward.\n\n\"The importance of these uninhabited islands is far greater than the value of the fish there,\" Reichert said. The proposed protection zone holds some of the world's \"richest marine life and least disturbed areas. It's immensely valuable to science and home to vast numbers of ocean species.\" He added, \"the importance of keeping these places intact far transcends the short-term value of what can be extracted for commercial gain.\"\n\nThe president also established a task force of at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Pentagon and Justice Department, that must develop recommendations to better combat seafood fraud and illegal fishing within the next six months.\n\nIllegal seafood accounts for one-fifth to one-third of wild-caught seafood imported to the U.S. in 2011, according to a recent study in the journal Marine Policy. Further, about one-third of seafood is mislabeled, according to a study last year by the environmental group Oceana, which analyzed more than 1,200 seafood samples bought in 21 states. The study found that fish sold as snapper was misidentified 87 percent of the time and tuna was mislabeled 59 percent of the time.\n\n\"Because our seafood travels through an increasingly long, complex and non-transparent supply chain, there are numerous opportunities for seafood fraud to occur and illegally caught fish to enter the U.S. market,\" said Beth Lowell, director of Oceana's Stop Seafood Fraud campaign. \"By tracing our seafood from boat to plate, consumers will have more information about the fish they purchase.\"\n\nThe White House plan would also improve monitoring of ocean acidification, fueled by the ever-greater amounts of carbon dioxide the oceans absorb. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by about 40 percent since the preindustrial era, thanks to the combustion of fossil fuels, according to a report issued Tuesday by the White House Office of Science and Technology.\n\nOceans absorb about 25 percent of the carbon dioxide that human activity generates, and when the gas dissolves in seawater, some of it forms carbonic acid. Greater ocean acidity poses a threat to a range of marine life, including coral reefs and shellfish beds, like oyster hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest. Under the plan, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would get $9 million over three years to better monitor the local effect of ocean acidification, which, in turn, could help individual coastal communities.'"

            "title": "Can sea life adapt to souring oceans?",
            "text": "\tSANTA BARBARA, Calif. - The violet bottom-dwelling, prickle-backed spheres wriggling in the tank in Gretchen Hofmann's lab aren't really known for their speed.\n\nBut these lowly sea urchins adapt so quickly they're helping answer a question that's key to understanding ocean acidification:\n\nAs fossil-fuel emissions disrupt marine life, will evolution come to the rescue?\n\nLike Darwin's finches or Great Britain's peppered moths, these hedgehogs of the sea increasingly embody nature's stunning capacity for resilience.\n\nA number of plants and animals threatened by souring seas, including some mussels, abalone, rock oysters, plankton and even a few fish, appear likely - at least at first - to adjust or evolve. But few seem as wired as these saltwater pincushions to come through the next several decades unscathed.\n\nYet work with urchins, as well as other species, suggests that acidification sooner or later may still push these and other marine organisms beyond what they can tolerate.\n\n\"Evolution can happen, and it can happen quickly,\" said Hofmann, a marine biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), who has studied urchins for years. \"But concerns about extinctions are very real and very valid. Biology can bend, but eventually it will break.\"\n\nThe oceans are absorbing a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal, oil and natural gas. That, researchers say, is causing sea chemistry to change faster than it has for tens of millions of years.\n\nWhich plants and animals can accommodate these more corrosive seas - and for how long - will depend on many factors, from where they live to their population sizes to the depth of stress they face from other forces, such as warming temperatures and pollution. Survival will vary species by species. Not everything will make it.\n\n\"This kind of change is not free; evolution is not a gentle sport,\" said Stephen Palumbi, an evolutionary ecologist at Stanford University, who also works extensively with urchins. \"When evolution happens, it's because the unfit are dying. It's pretty brutal.\"\n\nAnd that's when things work well.\n\nIn the late 2000s, commercial urchin fisherman Bruce Steele feared things would not go so well. And for good reason.\n\nUrchins graze on algae, drive out kelp and are eaten by sea otters, sunflower stars and humans. Steele, a scuba diver, had made his living since the 1970s scooping the spiny delicacies off the seafloor to sell to sushi restaurants as uni.\n\nBut when he read a research paper about acidification, he saw right away what it could mean for his business - and for the ocean he loved.\n\n\"When you start knocking out the very bottom of the food chain, it's incredibly terrifying,\" Steele said. \"But that's what the research is showing us.\"\n\nIncreasing CO2 not only makes oceans more corrosive, it reduces carbonate ions, which everything from scallops to crabs, coral and sea urchins need to build shells or skeletons.\n\nSo Steele dialed up Hofmann, his local university expert on spiky echinoderms.\n\n\"She thought it was a crank call or something, because ... I don't know,\" Steele said. \"I guess people figure a sea urchin diver's not going to be reading a whole bunch of science.\"\n\nHofmann dismissed Steele at first, but quickly called back and started investigating his concerns. She exposed sea urchin larvae to high-CO2 water and made a troubling discovery: Their bodies often got smaller.\n\n\"Overall, their body size really matters in how well they swim and how much food they get,\" Hofmann said. \"So if you're smaller, it's really bad news if you're a baby sea urchin in the water.\"\n\nBut Hofmann noticed something else, too: Some larvae didn't change at all.\n\n\"When we started raising our babies in the lab, we saw that some of them shrank,\" Hofmann said. \"But, in fact, some of them didn't. There were some in there that didn't respond the same way.\"\n\nHofmann knew enough about genetics to know that distinction might prove important.\n\n---\n\nIn the century after Charles Darwin returned from the Galapagos carrying birds with different-shaped beaks, these finches came to represent the power of natural selection. As the birds expanded to areas with new foods, variations in their genetic code allowed new traits to emerge.\n\nSuch selection can be simple, elegant and fast. In Manchester, England, a common tree moth evolved from mostly speckled ivory to black in just decades. Soot from the Industrial Revolution had killed lichen and darkened local trees, which scientists believe allowed birds to more readily pick off the lighter insects. Once pollution was controlled, the tree trunks grew light again, and ivory-colored moths returned to dominance.\n\nHofmann suspected variations in urchin DNA left some predisposed to handle acidified seas. Nature, quite by accident, had been preparing a long time for this very moment.\n\nIt was all about the water. Water chemistry close to shore is rarely static. Ocean CO2 can vary with the time of day or the tides, when plants suck up CO2 to grow, or when animals die and decay.\n\nThe change is more pronounced in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. When heavy winds blow along shore, deep, cold water that naturally holds more CO2 suddenly wells up from the bottom and gets drawn toward the beach. That means some West Coast urchins have spent millions of years being exposed to high-CO2 waters.\n\nIn fact, upwelling is part of the reason Northwest oyster larvae were among the world's first-known victims of acidification. Because the water already was near the extreme edge of what oyster larvae can tolerate, when man-made acidification spiked it higher, that wiped out billions of shellfish.\n\nSo Hofmann and a colleague, UCSB evolutionary biologist Morgan Kelly, mated \"wimpy\" Southern California sea urchins - those experiencing less CO2 exposure - with hardier males from northern upwelling zones.\n\nThe result: northern animals passed on genes more resistant to acidified water.\n\n\"The progeny, the babies - the kids - of that father were much better at maintaining the size of their body and not succumbing to the stress of high-CO2 water,\" Hofmann said.\n\nAt the same time, Palumbi and other Stanford researchers reared urchins in water from Southern California and from high-CO2 zones in Oregon. They found the frequency of some gene sequences shifted in response to growing up under higher CO2.\n\nUrchins, in both cases, were showing they could evolve.\n\n\"It was really kind of surprising, and a little bit on the hopeful side,\" Hofmann said.\n\nThe very upwelling phenomenon that makes the Northwest an acidification hot spot could actually help some species get through it.\n\nBut which ones? And for how long?\n\n\"The truth is we don't know,\" Palumbi said. \"The experiments don't tell us how long it will take for them to reach their limit. And it doesn't tell us the price they'll pay.\"\n\n---\n\nAnimals affected by elevated CO2 don't always need to adapt. Sometimes new environmental stressors trigger a change in the way they or their offspring use the genes they have.\n\nFor example, baby clownfish born to parents reared in high-CO2 water seem to survive just fine, while juvenile clownfish simply placed in high-CO2 water die more often.\n\nParents produce kids that survive better in the environment they're going to face, said Australian scientist Gabrielle Miller, at James Cook University, who has studied this phenomenon. \"But it's not a change in genetic makeup. It's not evolution.\"\n\nThere are, however, signs that some fish, too, might evolve in response to acidification. Scientist Philip Munday, also at James Cook University, recently exposed wild damselfish to CO2 levels expected in coming decades. That water fouled up behavior for half the animals, leading many to die prematurely.\n\nBut, importantly, half the fish didn't seem to change at all, and they survived as well as normal, healthy fish. Does that mean that some of these Great Barrier Reef fish were genetically predisposed to dealing with higher CO2? It's too soon to say.\n\n\"For some organisms, especially short-lived species, there is considerable opportunity for adaptation,\" Munday said.\n\nBut evolution does have limits. When scientists breed mice for size, they get bigger over successive generations until reaching a point where they can get no larger. So what happens if the driver of all this change is an environmental cue that just keeps worsening?\n\nNot every species can adapt enough. And not all of those that can will do so at the same speed, even if they live in similarly variable environments, such as areas near shore.\n\nWhen Kelly, in Santa Barbara, exposed a microscopic species of tide-pool plankton to higher temperatures expected in coming years, she found these copepods lived in such an isolated environment they lacked genetic capacity to adapt much at all.\n\nWhen Jennifer Sunday, at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C., studied mussels, she found that they, like urchins, are exposed to wild swings in sea chemistry. But evidence suggested these fast-growing mussels would still take far longer than slow-growing, long-lived urchins to adapt to rising CO2.\n\nAnd that pace can matter a great deal.\n\nWhile adaptation is underway, many creatures may die, which can shrink populations - sometimes substantially. The question is, how many individuals can each species afford to lose?\n\nThat's one reason scientists believe that organisms with enormous populations, like urchins, have the best shot.\n\n\"Our results are less likely to apply to species that live in less variable environments - for instance, open-ocean fish,\" Kelly said. \"And our results are less likely to apply to species with small population sizes.\"\n\nThree other issues, however, remain concerning for those trying to predict the marine world's future. For starters, acidification and ocean warming will occur simultaneously.\n\n\"What happens if the individuals best able to tolerate high temperatures are the least tolerant to high CO2?\" Munday asked. \"That could slow adaptation for either of those traits.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in 40 or 50 years, CO2 in places like the Northwest will reach extremes even hardy animals like urchins have never experienced in their history. Scientists aren't certain adaptation will keep up.\n\n\"Eventually we're going to push things up against the guardrails of their tolerances and, pretty soon, they're going to go right over the cliff,\" Hofmann said. \"That's what's worrisome.\"\n\nLastly, all these changes will take place at once, potentially leading many populations to struggle as their food - and their predators - do the same. It's tough to predict how that could upend relationships in the sea.\n\n\"The bottom line is we can't count on adaptation to erase the effects of ocean acidification,\" said Kelly. \"It's just not a panacea.\"\n\nBut Palumbi, at Stanford, said it could buy the world time to address the problem.\n\n\"Frankly, it seems to me that we need to use that extra time,\" he said.'"

            "title": "Sea Change: Ocean acidification drives oyster farmers to Hawaii",
            "text": "\tHILO, Hawaii - It appears at the end of a palm tree-lined drive, not far from piles of hardened black lava: the newest addition to the Northwest's famed oyster industry.\n\nHalf an ocean from Seattle, on a green patch of island below a tropical volcano, a Washington state oyster family built a 20,000-square-foot shellfish hatchery.\n\nOcean acidification left the Nisbet family no choice.\n\nCarbon dioxide from fossil fuel emissions had turned seawater in Willapa Bay along Washington's coast so lethal that slippery young Pacific oysters stopped growing. The same corrosive ocean water got sucked into an Oregon hatchery and routinely killed larvae the family bought as oyster seed.\n\nSo the Nisbets became the closest thing the world has seen to ocean acidification refugees. They took out loans and spent $1 million and moved half their production 3,000 miles away.\n\n\"I was afraid for everything we'd built,\" Goose Point Oyster Co. founder Dave Nisbet said of the hatchery, which opened last year. \"We had to do something.\"\n\nOysters started dying by the billions along the Northwest coast in 2005, and have been struggling ever since. When scientists cautiously linked the deaths to plummeting ocean pH in 2008 and 2009, few outside the West Coast's $110 million industry believed it.\n\nBy the time scientists confirmed it early last year, the region's several hundred oyster growers had become a global harbinger - the first tangible sign anywhere in the world that ocean acidification already was walloping marine life and hurting people.\n\nWorried oystermen testified before Congress. A few hit the road to speak at science conferences. Washington's governor at the time, Chris Gregoire, established a task force of ocean acidification experts, who sought ways to fight this global problem locally.\n\nThe eight years of turmoil the Nisbet family endured trying to outrun their corroding tides offered them a unique perch from which to view debate over CO2 emissions.\n\n\"I don't care if you think it's the fault of humans or not,\" Nisbet said. \"If you want to keep your head in the sand, that's up to you. But the rest of us need to get it together because we're not out of the woods yet on this thing.\"\n\nThe industry in Willapa Bay, a shallow estuary, and Puget Sound employs about 3,200 people and produces one-quarter of the nation's oysters.\n\nThe Nisbets bought 10 acres of tidelands near Bay Center in 1975 and built their business over decades, one market at a time.\n\nSometimes Dave Nisbet's daughter Kathleen, now 27, came along. She sipped a baby bottle and ate cookies while riding the dredge with her father. The Nisbets eventually pieced together 500 acres of tidelands and hired 70 people.\n\nFor a long time, business was good - until, overnight, it suddenly wasn't.\n\nIt's hard to imagine now how far CO2 was from anyone's mind when the oysters crashed.\n\nIn 2005, when no young oysters survived in Willapa Bay at all, farmers blamed the vagaries of nature. After two more years with essentially no reproduction, panic set in. Then things got worse.\n\nBy 2008, oysters were dying at Oregon's Whiskey Creek Hatchery, which draws water directly from the Pacific Ocean. The next year, it struck a Taylor Shellfish hatchery outside Quilcene, which gets its water from Hood Canal. Owners initially suspected bacteria, but shellfish died even when it wasn't present.\n\nEach spring, the Nisbets put an order in with Whiskey Creek until the mid-2000s, when that option vanished.\n\n\"The hatchery had a long waiting list of customers and no seed, and we had a small window of time to get it into the bay,\" Dave Nisbet recalled. \"They had nothing.\"\n\nWhiskey Creek hatchery closed for weeks at a stretch. Production at Taylor Shellfish was off more than 60 percent. The entire industry was on the brink. Oyster growers from Olympia to Grays Harbor worried that in a few years' time they would not be able to bring shellfish to market.\n\nDave Nisbet made frantic calls, but could not find another source.\n\nIn 2008, Kathleen Nisbet fretted about the prospect of laying off people her family had employed since she'd been in diapers.\n\nAnd no one, anywhere, could tell them what was wrong.\n\nThen the oyster growers met the oceanographers.\n\nDick Feely, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the early 2000s was noting a dramatic change off the West Coast.\n\nLow pH water naturally occurred hundreds of feet down, where the colder water held more CO2. But that corrosive water was rising swiftly, getting ever closer to the surface where most of the marine life humans care about lived.\n\nIn 2007, Feely organized a crew of scientists to measure and track that water from Canada to Mexico.\n\n\"What surprised us was we actually saw these very corrosive waters for the very first time get to the surface in Northern California,\" he said.\n\nThat hadn't been expected for 50 to 100 years. And that wasn't the worst of it.\n\nBecause of the way the ocean circulates, the corrosive water that surfaces off Washington, California and Oregon is the result of CO2 that entered the sea decades earlier. Even if emissions get halted immediately, West Coast sea chemistry - unlike the oceans at large - would worsen for several decades before plateauing.\n\nIt would take 30 to 50 years before the worst of it reached the surface.\n\nFeely published his findings in 2008.\n\nHe explained to the oyster farmers that when north winds blew, deep ocean water was drawn right to the beach, which meant this newly corrosive water probably got sucked into the hatchery. That same water also flowed into the Strait of Juan de Fuca and made its way to Hood Canal.\n\nThe oyster industry pleaded with Congress, which supplied money for new equipment. Over several years, the hatcheries tested their water using high-tech pH sensors. When the pH was low, baby oysters died within two days. By drawing water only when the pH was normal, shellfish production got back on track.\n\n\"They told us it was like turning on headlights on a car - it was so clear what was going on,\" Feely said.\n\nIt wasn't until 2012 that Feely and a team from Oregon State University finally showed with certainty that acidification had caused the problem. Early this summer OSU professor George Waldbusser demonstrated precisely how.\n\nThe oysters were not dissolving. They were dying because the corrosive water forced the young animals to use too much energy. Acidification had robbed the water of important minerals, so the oysters worked far harder to extract what they needed to build their shells.\n\nWaldbusser still is not entirely sure why acidification has not yet hit other oyster species. It could be because other species, such as the native Olympic, have evolved to be more adaptable to high CO2, or because they rear larvae differently, or because they spawn at a time of year when corrosive water is less common. It could also be that acidification is just not quite bad enough yet to do them harm.\n\nBy then, the Nisbets had moved on. They now had their own hatchery, which drew water from a warm, underground, saltwater aquifer. When the tiny bivalves reared there are big enough to produce shells, they are mailed back to Washington and planted in Willapa Bay.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there's nothing more to fear.\n\nFor now, no one else has taken as dramatic a step as the Nisbets. The Northwest industry is getting around the problem. Hatcheries have changed the timing of when they draw in water. Scientists installed ocean monitors that give hatchery owners a few days' notice that conditions will be poor for rearing larvae.\n\nGrowers are crushing up shells and adding chemicals to the water to make it less corrosive. Shellfish geneticists are working to breed new strains of oysters that are more resistant to low pH water.\n\nBut no one thinks any of that will work forever.\n\n\"I do not think people understand the seriousness of the problem,\" David Stick, manager of the hatchery in Hilo, said. \"Ocean acidification is going to be a game-changer. It has the potential to be a real catastrophe.\"\n\nAt the moment, the problem only strikes oysters at the very early stages of their development, within the first week or so of life.\n\nBut how long will that be the case? How would they respond to changes in the food web?\n\n\"The algae is changing,\" Stick said. \"The food source that everything depends on is changing. Will things adapt? We don't know. We've never had to face anything like this before.\"\n\nWith one young son, and a baby on the way, it's been impossible for Kathleen Nisbet not to think about her own next generation.\n\n\"I don't think that our government is recognizing that ocean acidification exists,\" she said. \"I don't think society understand the impacts it has. They think ocean acidification ... no big deal, it's a huge ocean.\"\n\nBut the reality is, over the next decade, the world will have to make progress tackling this issue.\n\n\"We're living proof,\" Nisbet said. \"If you ignore it, it's only going to get worse. Plain and simple: It will get worse.\" '"

            "text": "\tTHEODORE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK, N.D. - From the vista where Valerie Naylor stands, the scenery is undeniably spectacular: Sculpted hills with layers of beige sandstone and ribbons of gray coal, pockets of cottonwood trees and junipers rustling, the serpentine Little Missouri River shimmering below.\n\nMost visitors who come to the Oxbow Overlook feel its serenity. But Naylor, the park's superintendent, worries. \"So much of what you're looking at is outside the park, and it's so vulnerable,\" she said.\n\n## How Will She Protect It All?\n\nAs North Dakota's historic Bakken oil boom mushrooms around this little-known national park, Naylor, 56, is on a mission to keep its natural sounds, fresh air and breathtaking views free from the effects of runaway industrial development.\n\nWith a drilling frenzy now hitting a production milestone of 1 million barrels of oil a day, that work is getting more urgent. Naylor's fight to protect the park reflects a larger drama still unfolding across this vast region as it struggles to balance the mind-boggling jackpot of the oil boom with its accompanying trade-offs. Almost every week it seems there's a new proposal near the 70,000-acre park, Naylor said. One week it's a cell tower. Another it's a saltwater disposal well. \"If you don't keep your eye on everything, you could easily miss something that could have a massive impact on the park,\" she said. She estimates that she and her staff have tried to get changes on more than 20 development plans since the boom began, often through polite but firm letters, testimony and follow-up conversations.\n\nModest and plainspoken, Naylor neither apologizes for nor touts her efforts.\n\nThe park is \"a very special place,\" she said. \"It deserves the same kind of protection as the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.\"\n\nAs Naylor eased a hybrid SUV up the park's north unit scenic drive, she pointed to a boundary fence amid fields of grasses and sweet clover. In the distance, an oil pump hammered slowly.\n\nThough that well is still within view of the park, it's better than it could have been, Naylor said. A few years ago, that pump and its large storage tanks and infrastructure were proposed for a spot right along the fence. It was one of the first developments that Naylor successfully worked with a company to get moved away.\n\nNaylor wrote letters to the company, and representatives there were receptive to moving the pumping station almost 2 miles away, she said, but it took the company months of paperwork and negotiating.\n\n\"We're very appreciative,\" Naylor said. \"It was very complex and a lot of work.\"\n\n## Like \"Swatting Flies\"\n\nTo Naylor, the park is a perfect example of what a national park should be: wildlife, scenery and historical value. The park was named after the president who hunted buffalo in that area as a young man from New York, and later briefly lived there as a rancher while grieving the loss of his wife and mother.\n\nNaylor's affinity for the place began more than four decades ago, when she visited with her parents as a teenager from Oregon. She vowed to come back. She volunteered there as young adult, did research there during graduate school, and became the park's superintendent 11 years ago.\n\nNow, North Dakota has more than 11,000 producing wells, and the state's oil and gas division estimates capacity for 60,000 more, with drilling continuing for at least 20 years.\n\nAt times at some vistas, Naylor said a park visitor could see more than 20 natural gas flares shining in the distance.\n\nWith no single clearinghouse for applications along the park's miles of jagged boundary, Naylor and her staff, along with the North Dakota citizen group Badlands Conservation Alliance, have been scouring meeting agendas of local and county governments and state commissions. They can only oppose the proposed developments that they see.\n\n\"There's so many things going on so quickly. It might be a pipeline, power line, oil well, rail loading facility or new road ... any number of things,\" Naylor said.\n\nSometimes companies don't even realize that they're proposing development near the park boundaries, she and others said.\n\nState officials proposed mandating a public comment period for certain oil and gas drilling plans up to 2 miles surrounding the park and 17 other areas deemed \"extraordinary places\" in North Dakota this year. Industry groups including the North Dakota Petroleum Council opposed the change, arguing that special interests shouldn't trump the rights of private landowners. Officials scaled back the idea to allow public comment time for only public land developments in those zones.\n\nThe national park boundary abuts some drilling-susceptible public forest service land, which already has more than 600 wells in the western part of the state.\n\nMinneapolis hiker David Kingman said he's been watching the conservation efforts of Naylor and others with interest as he spends much of his time in North Dakota now, managing a worker housing complex. He treasures the beautiful scenery on the park's marked trails, as well as on its unmarked bison trails, he said. Fending off development nearby, he said, looks like \"swatting flies.\"\n\n\"They've got to just keep working at it,\" he said, \"but some get through.\"\n\n## Sounds, Scents And Light\n\nNaylor and others want to protect not only scenic natural views, but also the park's solitude: The sound of blowing wind and singing birds, not the hum of traffic. The scent of sagebrush, not the sting of chemicals. The darkness of the night sky, not the glow of gas flares.\n\nTypically, it works best to raise concerns directly with a company, Naylor said. Most are amenable, she said. She uses a diplomatic tone: \"We are not opposed to energy development,\" she is quick to say, \"but we want it done in such a way that the park is preserved.\"\n\nNew drilling techniques have made it easier for oil companies to comply with their requests, said North Dakota Petroleum Council communications manager Tessa Sandstrom.\n\n\"Thanks to the technology of horizontal drilling, you can be a little bit more flexible on where you put that drilling rig and still be able to recover the resources,\" she said, adding that companies \"always try to keep an open dialogue.\"\n\nOne company put out a news release after abandoning a development plan, touting its commitment to preservation. Horizon Oilfield Services announced in April that it withdrew a permit application for an injection well near the park's boundaries. The company highlighted a \"desire to preserve the natural beauty and integrity of North Dakota public lands and National Parks,\" the release said.\n\nJan Swenson, executive director of the Badlands Conservation Alliance, targets development in not only the national park, but in all sorts of natural areas in the state.\n\nOften, she and Naylor will appear at the same meetings, Swenson said, though she added that Naylor is probably more of a \"realist\" in choosing what to oppose.\n\n\"Sometimes I wish the Park Service was even more aggressive,\" Swenson said. Still, she said, \"we are ever so lucky to have her.\"\n\n## Tourists Unaware\n\nAs they drive the winding, scenic roads or march up the trails of the Badlands, most park tourists have no idea what Naylor and other preservationists have fended off. No idea that Naylor won an award for her stewardship from the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nDeb Hornfeldt and Debbie Virnig carefully maneuvered a 32-foot Forester camper on the scenic drive to Oxbow Overlook. It was their last national park stop on their way back to Lakeland, Minnesota, from a road trip in the Western United States. They sought out parks to find serenity, they said.\n\n\"My stress level gets much smaller,\" said Hornfeldt, a recently retired teacher. \"It's really important to have places like this. People crave this.\"\n\nOil pumpers and more flares and traffic would spoil the grandeur, Hornfeldt said.\n\n\"Find another place,\" added Virnig, who spoke in sign language with Hornfeldt translating. Natural spaces are getting smaller and smaller, she said.\n\nWith an average of fewer than 600,000 visitors a year recently, Theodore Roosevelt Park has never been among the country's most-visited. But as the population around it increases, the hum of the boom permeating the landscape, its popularity may increase.\n\nOn Christmas Day, for instance, when the park is usually abandoned, a dozen cars were in the parking lot, Naylor said. Oil industry workers now seek it out to get away from the constant construction, traffic, dust and noise that the boom has brought. That slice of serenity is more important than ever, Naylor knows.\n\nGravel crunched under Naylor's ranger boots as she hiked to the River Bend Overlook, which she pronounced \"the most beautiful view in all of North Dakota.\" She held her wide-brimmed hat against the whipping prairie winds.\n\n\"I love this park,\" Naylor said. \"I will continue to always protect it.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Faith Spotted Eagle figures that building a crude oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast would bring little to Indian Country besides more crime and dirty water, but she doubts that [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) will ever get the U.S. government to block the $7 billion project.\n\n\"There is no way for Native people to say no - there never has been,\" said Spotted Eagle, 65, a Yankton Sioux tribal elder from Lake Andes, S.D. \"Our history has caused us not to be optimistic. ... When you have capitalism, you have to have an underclass - and we're the underclass.\"\n\nOpponents may be down after a State Department study found that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would not contribute to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). But they haven't abandoned their goal of killing what some call \"the black snake.\"\n\nIn South Dakota, home to some of the nation's poorest American Indians, tribes are busy preparing for nonviolent battle with \"resistance training\" aimed at TransCanada, the company that wants to develop the 1,700-mile pipeline.\n\nWhile organizers said they want to keep their strategy a secret, they're considering everything from vigils to civil disobedience to blockades to thwart the moving of construction equipment and the delivery of materials.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we possibly can,\" said Greg Grey Cloud of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, who attended a two-day conference and training session in Rapid City last week sponsored by the Oglala Sioux Tribe called \"Help Save Mother Earth from the Keystone Pipeline.\" He said tribes are considering setting up encampments to follow the construction, but he stressed that any actions would be peaceful. \"We're not going to damage anything or riot or anything like that,\" he said.\n\nLike much of the country, however, tribal members are divided over the pipeline. In South Dakota, the battle pits those who fear irreversible effects on the environment and public safety against those who trumpet the economic payoff and a chance to cash in on a kind of big development project that rarely comes along.\n\nIn Winner, S.D., where the population numbers fewer than 3,000, Mayor Jess Keesis is eager to welcome construction workers from a 600-member \"man camp\" that would open just 10 miles from town if President Barack Obama approves the pipeline.\n\n\"Out here on the prairie, you know, we're a tough people,\" said Keesis, who's also a member of the Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation in Kansas. \"We deal with drought and 8-foot blizzards and all kinds of stuff all the time, so anytime we can get something like this to give us a shot, it's a good thing.\"\n\nOpponents say the risks are too great.\n\nTwo weeks ago, an alliance of Native American groups approved a statement saying emphatically that no pipeline would be allowed in South Dakota and that tribes stand ready to protect their \"sacred water\" and other natural resources.\n\nThat includes Native women, who opponents of the pipeline say would become easy prey for thousands of temporary construction workers housed in work camps. According to the federal government, one of every three Indian women are either raped or sexually assaulted during their lifetimes, with the majority of attacks done by non-Native men.\n\n\"If you like to drink water, if you like your children not being harmed, if you don't want your women being harmed, then say no to the pipeline,\" Grey Cloud said. \"Because once it comes, it's going to destruct everything.\"\n\nOpponents said they don't want to have to follow through on their plans. They hope that they have the ultimate trump card with a president who just happens to be an adopted Indian. That would be Barack Black Eagle, who was formally adopted by Hartford and Mary Black Eagle of Montana's Crow Indian Tribe in 2008, when he visited the tribal reservation during his first presidential run.\n\n\"They didn't do that by accident - they saw something in him, and I hope he recognizes that within himself,\" Spotted Eagle said.\n\nGrey Cloud said Obama would be \"going against his word\" if he approves the pipeline: \"His main promise was to not allow pollution in our area.\"\n\nKeesis said the project carries risks but ultimately would be a winner for the region. He said the city of Winner and surrounding Tripp County would get a windfall of roughly $900,000 a year from construction workers patronizing the town's restaurants, bars and its recently upgraded digital theater. Even the city would make money, hauling liquid waste from the nearby construction camp to its municipal facilities.\n\nAfter spending 20 years working in oilfields and boomtowns, he's convinced that much has changed, with construction workers \"under the gun to behave.\"\n\n\"I've been in boomtowns all my life: Wyoming, Texas, California, Colorado, Alaska, everywhere,\" he said. \"I don't think it's going to be near as bad as what people have in their minds. The oilfield, as with any other occupation like this, has really mellowed over the last 20 years. It's not the Wild West like it used to be. ... But you've got to take a little bad with the good.\"\n\nObama, who has not said when he'll make a final decision, is under heavy pressure to approve the project. Just last week, all 45 Republican senators sent a letter to the president, saying thousands of jobs are at stake and reminding him that he had promised them to make a decision by the end of 2013.\n\nNationally, project backers appear to be riding the momentum, armed with a State Department report on Jan. 31 that minimized the climate change impact of building the pipeline. Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said the report shows Americans that there is \"no reason, scientific or otherwise, to block this project any longer.\"\n\nWhile Obama has kept mum, his administration has been offering hope to tribal officials.\n\n\"If we're developing an area that runs through Indian Country, it's very important that we reach an agreement that makes sense to tribes,\" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told tribal officials during a visit to Oklahoma in November, according to a story published in the Native American Times. \"If not, that might mean the pipeline or transmission line goes somewhere else.\"\n\nIn South Dakota, the proposed line would not go through any of the state's nine reservations, but opponents say its close proximity would still pose a hazard.\n\nTransCanada officials say they've worked closely with the tribes, even halting work in northeast Texas last year as a team of archaeological contractors dug for Indian artifacts at a sacred site.\n\nWith the southern section of the pipeline already open, company spokesman Terry Cunha said TransCanada is now working with 17 tribes in South Dakota, Montana and Nebraska, where the company needs Obama's approval to build. He said the company hopes to begin work in those states in 2015.\n\nCunha said the company expects the pipeline to have a \"limited impact\" on the environment and that its work camps will be provided with around-the-clock security.\n\n\"We see it as a positive benefit,\" he said.\n\nBesides the short-term construction work, Keesis said his city would gain another 30 to 40 permanent residents who would work on pipeline-related jobs. He said Winner needs a lift, noting that since the city shut down its strip clubs a few years back, fewer pheasant hunters are visiting, opting to stay in big hunting lodges nearby.\n\n\"When I moved here, during the first three weeks of pheasant season, you couldn't find a parking space,\" he said. \"Now you can park anywhere.\"\n\nBut the economic argument is a hard sell for many tribal members in South Dakota, where history is still raw. It's the scene of the some of the bloodiest battles between Indians and the federal government, including the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee Creek by the U.S. 7th Cavalry that killed nearly 300 Sioux.\n\nSpotted Eagle said she feels obligated to try to stop the pipeline, both to provide toxic-free land and water for her grandchildren and to protect women from attacks.\n\n\"This is a form of militarism, bringing in these man camps,\" said Spotted Eagle. \"For those of us who have the history, it smacks of repetitive economics, when they put us in forts and they wanted our land. ... All we're willing to do here is sell our soul, just for the economy. That's the dark side.\"'"

            "text": "\tThe skeletal remains of an infant who lived in what is now Montana about 12,600 years ago will be reburied in a formal ceremony now that scientists have sequenced its genome, researchers say.\n\nThe fragments of the young boy's skeleton are the sole human remains directly associated with the short-lived Clovis culture, according to scientists. The relics were accidentally discovered by a construction worker in 1968, at the so-called Anzick burial site in western Montana.\n\nThe fragments, as well as 125 stone and antler tools, were covered in red ochre, a powdered mineral that was probably used during a burial ceremony, scientists believe.\n\nIn a study published Wednesday in Nature, scientists sequenced the genome of the boy, age 1 to 1\\xc2\\xbd, and said their findings shed new light on the complex human colonization of North America.\n\nIt had generally been believed that the Clovis people's predecessors had come from Asia, via an ancient land bridge. However, a competing proposal - the Solutrean hypothesis - held that they were actually descended from people who had emigrated from southwestern Europe.\n\nThe new research argued strongly against that possibility, scientists said.\n\n\"The ancestors of this boy originated from Asia. The study does not support the idea that the first Americans originated from Europe, as proposed by the Solutrean hypothesis,\" said study co-author Michael Waters, an archaeologist at Texas A&amp;M University.\n\nWaters said the evidence showed the boy's remains were genetically related to most modern Native Americans, especially those in Central and South America.\n\n\"This indicates that a single migration of humans introduced the majority of the founding population of the Americas ... at the close of the last ice age,\" Waters said. \"These genetic findings are consistent with the archaeological evidence that shows the American continent was first explored and settled around 15,000 years ago, with Clovis emerging 2,000 years later.\"\n\nWhile conducting research, senior study author Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen, met with a number of [Native American tribes](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) in Montana to discuss the research. He said scientists and Native American groups haven't always gotten along well, so he wasn't sure what to expect at first.\n\n\"They showed a lot of interest in the study, but all of them said that now is the time for the skeleton to go back into the ground,\" Willerslev told a documentary film crew. \"This was a heart blow, because being a scientist, reburying probably the most important skeleton in the history of the Americas, it's hard.\"\n\nBut Willerslev said it was a sacrifice that science had to make.\n\n\"I realized that if scientists and Native Americans want to pursue their past together, there needs to be compromises on both sides. Therefore, we need to respect that they feel very strongly about this issue.\"\n\nThe Clovis culture is so named because its first remnants were found in 1932 in Clovis, N.M. To archaeologists, the culture is characterized by the distinctive fluted stone spear points it left behind. The points feature a groove that allows them to be secured to a shaft.\n\nWaters said the Clovis culture ended about 12,600 years ago, or around the same time the boy was buried. He said some of the tools buried with the boy were made of elk antlers - a rare commodity at the time - and dated to the beginning of the culture about 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe difference in age, Waters said, suggested the antler tools were ritual or heirloom objects that had been kept for generations. \"They were something special,\" he said.\n\nStudy co-author Shane Doyle, an enrolled member of the Crow tribe and a Native American studies instructor at Montana State University, acted as the liaison between researchers and local Native Americans during the study.\n\nAt a news briefing, Doyle told reporters the child's remains would be reburied this spring or summer. He also thanked the researchers for involving Native American tribes.\n\n\"I feel like this discovery basically confirms what tribes have really never doubted, that we've been here since time immemorial, and that all the artifacts, objects in the ground are remnants of our direct ancestors,\" Doyle said.'"

            "text": "\tORLANDO, Fla. - In the middle of \"Blackfish,\" the scathing documentary about SeaWorld's killer whale program, an activist says the whales in SeaWorld parks die early while their counterparts in the wild live as long as humans.\n\nThe claim, which goes unchallenged in the film, is a powerful contrast, meant to suggest that the giant marine mammals suffer when forced to live in man-made pools.\n\nYet SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. says its killer whales have life spans equivalent to those of wild orcas, an assertion the company makes to show that it provides a healthful, stimulating environment for the 29 orcas it owns at four marine parks - the largest captive collection on the planet.\n\nThe truth is not nearly as simple as either side claims. The fact is that scientists don't know for sure how long killer whales live.\n\nSome experts accuse both sides - the marine park industry, which is led by SeaWorld, and the anti-captivity movement, which \"Blackfish\" has come to symbolize - of cherry-picking research and manipulating statistics to support their arguments. That, they say, has muddied what should be an honest debate about whether the U.S. should continue to allow killer whales to be exhibited in captivity.\n\n\"Both sides skew the numbers,\" said John Hargrove, a former SeaWorld killer whale trainer who said he wants to see an end to captivity but who is also critical of what he calls the vocal \"fringe\" of animal rights groups.\n\n\"This is a debate, but you have to debate with facts,\" added Hargrove, who appears on screen in \"Blackfish.\"\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles to understanding the whales' life spans is that researchers have studied only a small percentage of the world's wild killer whales - a handful of populations off the coasts of Washington state, British Columbia and Alaska - long enough to reach trustworthy conclusions.\n\nKiller whales are found around the globe, from Iceland to Sri Lanka to Antarctica. There are at least nine genetically distinct \"ecotypes,\" Brad Hanson, a Seattle scientist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, wrote in an email.\n\nIt may be, for instance, that salmon-eating orcas in the Pacific Northwest have different life expectancies than mammal-eating orcas in the Southern Ocean.\n\nSeveral peer-reviewed studies conducted by U.S. and Canadian government researchers have calculated average life expectancies for killer whales in the Pacific Northwest. The results range from 30 to 50 years for females - depending on which specific population was studied and during what period - and from 19 to 31 years for males.\n\nIndividual whales can live much longer. Maximum longevity has been estimated at up to 90 years for females and 70 years for males, depending on the study.\n\nMost of SeaWorld's whales are far younger; only one has so far lived into her 40s.\n\nBut with the limited data available, scientists say it can be misleading to compare life expectancies between whales in the wild and those in captivity. Instead, they say, the more accurate comparison to use is the \"annual survival rate\" - essentially, an estimate of the percentage of whales in a population expected to survive each year.\n\nOne of the most recent studies of wild killer whales was led by Craig Matkin, executive director of the federally subsidized North Gulf Oceanic Society in Alaska. That survey found that a population of orcas off the southern Alaskan coast had annual survival rates generally of 97 percent to 99 percent, depending on their age.\n\nThe best known peer-reviewed study comparing annual survival rates between wild and captive killer whales was published in 1995 by a pair of fisheries service researchers. Using federal government records, they calculated an annual survival rate of a little more than 93 percent for captive orcas.\n\nThat's a substantial difference. Put another way: Captive whales were dying at a rate of more than 6 percent a year, close to three times the rate at which wild whales were dying.\n\nThat study continues to be widely cited today by animal rights groups and other activists. It's one of the studies the makers of \"Blackfish\" relied on while researching the film.\n\nBut newer studies suggest that captive whales are doing better. At a conference last month in New Zealand, a research team that included Douglas DeMaster - one of the co-authors of the 1995 study - gave a presentation indicating that the annual survival rate for captive whales had improved to about 98 percent in the past decade, based on data through November 2013.\n\nThe survival rate \"for captive killer whales seems to be improving, although that is certainly not the only metric that we should be using in evaluating husbandry practices in captivity,\" DeMaster said in an email interview. He added that newer data indicate that captive-born whales, in particular, appear to be surviving at about the same rate as wild whales.\n\nSeaWorld, for its part, says its whales have survived at an annual rate of about 98 percent during the past decade and about 97 percent during the past two decades. The annual survival rate for killer whales held at SeaWorld facilities since the 1960s is substantially lower, but the company says using the more recent data better reflects improvements in husbandry and veterinary care.\n\nOf course, most of SeaWorld's killer whales are younger and haven't yet lived long enough to know for sure whether they will match the lives of whales in the wild. When the company says its whales have equal life spans, it's actually making a projection on the basis of its annual survival rates during the past two decades, using an approach substantiated by researchers studying wild whales.\n\nBoth activists and SeaWorld have made questionable claims during the debate. Two examples occur within moments of each other in \"Blackfish.\"\n\nIn one instance, Howard Garrett, executive director of the Washington state conservation group The Orca Network, says, uncontested: \"We knew by 1980, after half a dozen years of the research, that they (wild killer whales) live equivalent to human life spans.\"\n\nAlthough it's true that individual killer whales can live as long as humans, the peer-reviewed research on killer whales in the Pacific Northwest suggests that, on average, they do not.\n\nGarrett said he based the statement partly on the fact that killer whales and humans have similar life phases. Female orcas, for instance, begin having calves at about age 14 and stop around age 40. But he also acknowledged that his comment was \"an oversimplification.\"\n\n\"When it is parsed with hard numbers from culled populations, there will be some differences between orca life spans and human life spans. But I don't think the differences are very significant,\" he said.\n\nMinutes later in the film, \"Blackfish\" shows a SeaWorld employee telling park visitors that killer whales are \"documented in the wild living to be about 35, mid-30s. They tend to live a lot longer in this environment because they have all the veterinary care.\" Another employee is also shown saying SeaWorld's whales have longer life spans. However, there is no research suggesting that captive killer whales live longer than wild ones.\n\nA SeaWorld spokesman said the company has never trained its animal education staff to say that SeaWorld's killer whales live longer than wild whales. But the company does train narrators to tell visitors that \"many species,\" including bottlenose dolphins, live longer in SeaWorld's care than in the wild and that \"the same may someday be true of killer whales.\"'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE - A Puget Sound orca held for decades at Miami's Seaquarium will gain the protection of the federal Endangered Species Act, a move expected to set the stage for a lawsuit from advocates seeking the whale's release.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Wednesday the decision to list Lolita as part of the southern resident killer whales of Puget Sound, which already are considered endangered under the federal act.\n\nWhale activists, who petitioned for this status, have long campaigned for Lolita's return to Puget Sound. They hope the listing will provide a stronger legal case to release Lolita than did a previous lawsuit that centered on alleged violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act.\n\n\"This gives leverage under a much stronger law,\" said Howard Garrett of the Whidbey Island-based Orca Network, which hopes a San Juan Island cove will one day serve as the site for Lolita to re-enter the wild. NOAA Fisheries officials on Wednesday described their decision in narrow terms, which set no broader precedents. It does not address whether Lolita should be released from the Seaquarium. \"This is a listing decision,\" said Will Stelle, the NOAA Fisheries regional administrator for the West Coast. \"It is not a decision to free Lolita.\"\n\nAquarium officials have repeatedly said they have no intention of releasing the orca. \"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years,\" Andrew Hertz, Seaquarium general manager, said in a statement. \"Lolita is healthy and thriving in her home where she shares habitat with Pacific white-sided dolphins. There is no scientific evidence that ... Lolita could survive in a sea pen or the open waters of the Pacific Northwest, and we are not willing to treat her life as an experiment.\"\n\nOrcas, also known as killer whales, are found in many of the world's oceans. The southern resident population, which spends several months each year in Puget Sound, is the only group listed in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe three pods in the population were reduced by captures by marine parks between 1965 and 1975, NOAA says. Among them was a roundup in Penn Cove where seven whales were captured, including Lolita.\n\nThe southern resident pods now number fewer than 80. Possible causes for the decline are reduced prey, pollutants that could cause reproductive problems and oil spills, according to NOAA Fisheries.\n\nUnder the Endangered Species Act, it is illegal to cause a \"take\" of a protected orca, which includes harming or harassing them.\n\nWednesday, NOAA officials said holding an animal captive, in and of itself, does not constitute a take.\n\nOrca activists are expected to argue in their lawsuit that Lolita's cramped conditions result in a prohibited take.\n\nThere is \"rising public scorn for the whole idea of performing orcas,\" said Garrett, who hopes Seaquarium will decide to release Lolita without a court order.\n\nBut NOAA officials still have concerns about releasing captive whales, and any plan to move or release Lolita would require \"rigorous scientific review,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe concerns include the possibility of disease transmission, the ability of a newly released orca to find food and behavior patterns from captivity that could have an impact on wild whales.\n\nNOAA said previous attempts to release captive orcas and dolphins have often been unsuccessful and some have ended in death.\n\nGarrett said the plan for Lolita calls for her to be taken to a netted area of the cove, which could be enlarged later. She would be accompanied by familiar trainers who could \"trust and reassure her every bit of the way,\" he said.\n\nThe controversy over releasing captive whales has been heightened by the experience of Keiko, a captive orca that starred in the 1993 movie \"Free Willy,\" about a boy who pushed for the release of a whale.\n\nIn 1998, Keiko was brought back to his native waters off Iceland to reintroduce him to life in the wild. That effort ended in 2003 when he died in a Norwegian fjord.\n\nGarrett, who visited Keiko in Iceland in 1999, said he was impressed by the reintroduction effort, and that there was plenty of evidence that Keiko was able to catch fish on his own.\n\n\"The naysayers predicted that as soon as he got into the (Icelandic) waters he would die, and wild orcas would kill him,\" Garrett said. \"He proved that 180-degrees wrong. He loved it.\"\n\nMark Simmons, who for two years served as director of animal husbandry for the Keiko-release effort, has a different view. He says Keiko never was able to forage for fish on his own, and that he continued to seek out human contact at every opportunity.\n\nSimmons wrote a book called \"Killing Keiko,\" that accuses the release effort of leading to a long slow death for the orca, which he says lacked food and then succumbed to an infection.\n\n\"It's not really the fact that Keiko died, but how he died,\" Garrett said Wednesday.'"

            "text": "\tIt would be so much easier if the whales had faced just one problem.\n\nIn the decade since Puget Sound's southern-resident killer whales were protected under the Endangered Species Act, scientists have figured out where orcas go in winter. They've learned these whales can tell a Chinook from a Sockeye salmon by using sonar to detect small differences in each fish's swim bladder. And researchers have documented the many ways these majestic mammals shift behavior in response to propeller and engine noise from boats.\n\nYet despite the vast rise in knowledge since [killer whales were listed as endangered in 2005](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), the region's orca population - already a fraction of what it was in the 1960s - still is not growing, according to a new synopsis of research on the cetaceans by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nScientists are \"trying to understand ... why the whales haven't increased more than they have,\" said Mike Ford, with the conservation biology program at NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.\n\nIn one sense, they already know: An explosion in whale science reveals that orcas face complex and overlapping threats that tend to compound one another.\n\n\"Part of what I hoped at the beginning was that it would be mostly one thing that was wrong,\" said Brad Hanson, a whale expert with the fisheries center. \"But they all appear to be intertwined.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, Puget Sound's killer whales numbered 140 - and some scientists suspect that a century before there might have been 200 or more. By the early 1970s, after entrepreneurs began capturing orcas for sale to marine parks, the population had plummeted to just 71. Capture was outlawed a few years later, and orca populations climbed to 99 in the mid-1990s.\n\nAs of last year, only 82 remain.\n\nThree main factors appear to contribute to their decline - a lack of food, the buildup of pollutants in their bodies and disturbance by marine vessels. Still, understanding the subtle ways these and other marine-world changes interact only seems to get more complicated.\n\nThese whales, it turn out, may eat lingcod and halibut but key in mostly on Chinook, which face severe threats of their own. The region has spent tens of millions of dollars to try and improve this other ESA-protected species, although a scathing 2011 report suggested too little progress was being made.\n\nIn addition, noise from boats, which is on the rise, prompts orcas to speed up, work harder, slap their tails more and hunt less - which means they may burn more calories just as they're getting less food.\n\nNew rules require boaters and whale-watching vessels to stay 200 yards from whales, but state enforcement has shown the response has been decidedly mixed, said Lynne Barre, head of protected resources for NOAA's Seattle office.\n\nMeanwhile, these long-lived mammals already are among the most polluted animals on Earth, with toxins accumulating in their fat over decades. When whales get hungry, contaminants may well mobilize in their system, potentially affecting their health and reproduction.\n\nBut while efforts to clean up Puget Sound's legacy pollutants are underway, the whales' position at the top of the food chain means they still collect out-of-use pesticides like DDT and banned chemicals like PCBs. With other pollutants, such as flame retardants, only now being recognized, those will probably survive in killer whales for many decades longer.\n\nAnd all these issues are more complex than they first appear.\n\nFor example, some orca pods are more heavily burdened by DDT than others, most likely because they rely on fish from rivers in Central or Northern California, which are more heavily influenced by agriculture.\n\nWhales feeding on fish from the north, in more urbanized environments like Seattle and Vancouver, carry a bigger load of PCBs.\n\n\"They pick up contaminants from where they're going,\" Ford said. \"L and K pods tend to pick up California-type contaminants, compared to J pod, which doesn't, and that's consistent with their distribution.\"\n\nAnd these orcas are declining just as other Northwest marine mammals relying on fish - including seals, sea lions, even other killer whale populations - actually are on the rise.\n\nThe northern-resident killer whale population has tripled to nearly 300 since the 1960s. Northern and southern whales share similar diets. But Puget Sound's southern whales are distributed from California to Alaska, while the northern whales travel mostly between northern Washington and Alaska.\n\nThe growth of the northern population may even be helping keep the southern resident populations down.\n\n\"It's possible that some of those increases influence the rate at which southern resident populations grow,\" Ford said.\n\nFor starters, northern whales may have a food advantage.\n\n\"One thing we're considering is that the northern-resident population may have first crack at the best salmon stocks,\" Hanson said. \"A lot of the West Coast fish, they come out of the rivers, they turn right and head north.\"\n\nOther problems make life hard for southern residents.\n\nTwo of the three southern- resident pods have a shortage of young females. This population already gives birth to fewer young less often than northern residents, and \"it doesn't take much to tip the balance the wrong way,\" Hanson said.\n\nJ, K and L pods also often are born to parents within their pod, a form of inbreeding that could reduce genetic diversity and make whales susceptible to disease or genetic disorders.\n\nAnd there's no shortage of other mysteries.\n\nWhen killer whales die, they rarely wash up on the beach for researchers to find and study, Barre said. Instead, they just disappear and scientists never know what caused them to die.\n\nAnd much of their behavior remains unpredictable.\n\n\"Why do they sometimes decide to turn out toward the ocean and stay there for two weeks?\" he asked.'"

            "text": "\tISLAMABAD - In the wake of a massive earthquake in southwestern Pakistan, the death toll Wednesday rose sharply to nearly 300, officials and local media said.\n\nCrisis teams braced for more fatalities and rescue workers raced to reach isolated mountain communities.\n\nLocal television images from the southwestern area of Pakistan's earthquake-prone Baluchistan province showed the tangled remains of people's lives after the disaster - vast fields of mud, bricks, broken furniture, battered household items and traditional string beds. Most houses in the region bordering Iran are poorly constructed of basic materials.\n\nIn one video, a dazed man pawed through debris to collect a few meager possessions from his destroyed home.\n\nThe epicenter of the magnitude 7.7 earthquake, which struck at around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, was 40 miles northeast of Awaran. Initial reports placed the magnitude at 7.8.\n\nAs often follows when natural disasters hit relatively inaccessible areas, damage reports trickled in slowly, making it initially difficult to get a comprehensive picture of the damage.\n\nIn Baluchistan's Awaran district, among the worst-hit communities, a state of emergency was declared Tuesday. Baluchistan is Pakistan's largest but least-populated province, with about 13 million people.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the confirmed death toll in Awaran was 216 with approximately 400 people injured, according to an official with Baluchistan's home secretariat, who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media.\n\nAn official in the deputy commissioner's office of the adjoining Kech district, who also requested anonymity, said that district's latest death total was 43, based on doctors' reports. Media reports placed the number of known deaths across Pakistan at more than 285, including 20 bodies found Wednesday afternoon in an Awaran seminary.\n\nTelecommunications and medical facilities have been overwhelmed. By some accounts, 90 percent of Awaran's housing was destroyed, with thousands of people forced to spend Tuesday night in the open.\n\nTremors from the massive temblor were felt as far away as Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, and the Indian capital of New Delhi, several hundred miles to the east.\n\nMuhammad Akbar, 27, reached by telephone in Dandar in Kech district, said a first jolt Tuesday wasn't so big, but a second one destroyed virtually every building in the village, including his eight-room mud house, killing his cousin and many others.\n\n\"Right now, as I talk to you, I'm sitting on a rock beside the ruins,\" the teacher said, adding that no government rescue workers have arrived yet in their community. \"It's really hot, and we don't have any shelter. My three children were terrified, although they've now taken to playing in the debris. Our whole life is under the rubble.\"\n\nThe Pakistani army said in a statement that it had deployed more than 1,000 soldiers and Frontier Corps troops to search for survivors as six of its helicopters airlift the injured out of, and food and medicine into, the affected area.\n\nJan Buledi, a spokesman for the Baluchistan government, told a news conference that its offices were sending 1,000 tents, 500 food bags, various types of medicine and a dozen ambulances to Awaran. However, steep terrain and the lack of paved roads continued to impede rescue operations, officials said.\n\nOne of the more unusual characteristics of the earthquake was the near-spontaneous creation of an island a few hundred yards off the coast of Gwadar, a port city located about 200 miles southwest of Awaran in the Arabian Sea.\n\nSeismologists suspect that it's a temporary \"mud volcano\" formed when a jet of sand and muck gushes to the surface under pressure after an earthquake. Initial estimates were that the island was about 30 feet high and 100 feet long.\n\n\"If it is just mud, it's possible it will disappear soon,\" said Zahid Rafi, director at Pakistan's National Seismic Monitoring Center. \"In 1945, two mud islands emerged in the same area, and they later disappeared. It there's a rock beneath it, or it appeared because of the movement of a big rock, then it may stay.\"\n\nDr. Ali Rashid Tabrez, director-general of Karachi's National Institute of Oceanography, which sent a team to the island Wednesday to collect pictures and samples, said the seabed beneath the seismically active coastline contains vast amounts of frozen, highly pressurized methane gas that periodically thrusts slurry to the surface.\n\n\"During the last 15 years, three such islands emerged in the Makran coastal area, but they all disappeared after four or five months,\" he said.\n\nThough methane is not poisonous, anything in large amounts can be dangerous, he added, urging gawkers to avoid visiting Pakistan's newest, and perhaps most transitory, island.\n\nThe area around Awaran has significant seismic activity, given the convergence of three tectonic plates, the Eurasia, Arabia and India plates. The India plate's northbound movement into the Eurasia plate at a rate of about 1.5 inches a year has created the world's tallest mountains, including the Himalayan, Karakoram, Pamir and Hindu Kush ranges, capped by Mt. Everest.\n\nPakistan suffered the worst quake in its history in 2005, when a magnitude 7.6 temblor killed over 74,000 people.'"

            "title": "Panther releases: Do they work?",
            "text": "\tFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - In a remote part of southwestern Palm Beach County, as a platoon of reporters and photographers watched, a Florida panther was lowered to the ground in a crate.\n\nThe panther, raised for 18 months in captivity after his mother's death, crept out, took a look around, bolted down a dirt road and disappeared into the forest, a heartwarming Born Free image that appeared in newspapers and TV broadcasts.\n\nNine months later, the panther was dead of pneumonia.\n\nSuch a fate is common for male panthers rescued and released by state wildlife officers. Seventeen panthers have been released since the program started in 1987. All eight males are dead, three killed by other panthers, one by a vehicle, two by disease and two by unknown causes. Another could not be found after his tracking collar failed.\n\nThe Florida panther's cramped South Florida habitat holds about as many panthers as it can, and males let loose into this environment are at greater risk of being killed by other males defending their territory. Females typically do better and have produced many kittens.\n\nDespite the difficult path ahead, experts say the releases are not just feel-good wastes of money. With just 100 to 160 panthers remaining in the wild, they say any panthers added to the population help reduce its vulnerability to in-breeding or natural disaster.\n\n\"Every panther life is important at this point because you're dealing with one of the most critically [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) in the United States,\" said Jennifer Hecker, director of natural resource policy for the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. \"A catastrophic event like a fire or a hurricane could decimate the entire species.\"\n\nBut many people who live or hunt around panther habitat oppose any program that adds more of the cats to land already saturated with them. They say there are many more panthers than the state's estimates suggest, the panthers are losing their fear of people and are so desperate for territory that they're turning up around populated areas. Last week, the wildlife agency captured and relocated a young male found by a Collier County beach.\n\n\"There's no place for them to go,\" said Shirley Harner, of Boca Raton, who owns land with her husband north of Big Cypress. \"They're running out of food, and they're getting desperate. That's why they get urban, that's why they found one on the beach, that's why pets are being eaten. It's cruel to the cats, and it's dangerous to people.\"\n\nAlthough there have been no documented attacks on people by Florida panthers, the species has accounted for fatalities in western states, where it's known as the cougar or mountain lion.\n\nFlorida panthers inhabit a sweep of forest, prairie and Everglades that runs roughly from the Caloosahatchee River west of Lake Okeechobee to the southern end of Everglades National Park. The eastern boundaries extend to western Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nHousing developments, shopping centers and rock mines on the west coast continue to erode their habitat, with the latest threat the possibility of increased oil drilling. Squeezed into this shrinking area, 15 panthers were killed last year by vehicles and three by other panthers.\n\n\"We're facing enormous challenges with regard to protecting the remaining habitat of the panther,\" said Hecker. \"In the last few years, there has been a very large number of road mortality and (panther-on-panther) aggression, which is of course natural but we're more likely to see it when you're compressing their habitat.\"\n\nThe work going into rescuing panthers can be highly elaborate. Injured panthers require medical treatment. Orphaned panthers are taken to the White Oak Conservation Center near Jacksonville where they grow up with minimal human contact and learn to hunt on their own.\n\nThe costs vary. The wildlife agency says it ranges from $400 a month to care for three kittens whose mother died, to $3,000 a month to treat a panther with a broken leg. Although some veterinary services are donated, the state pays most of the bills, relying on sales of Protect the Panther license plates.\n\nOf the nine females released, eight have produced kittens. One female, rescued on the death of her mother, has produced seven litters totaling 12 kittens, and she's still out there.\n\nBut any male released will find himself plopped into a hostile world. One panther, rescued after his mother died, was killed by another male less than two months after his release into Big Cypress National Preserve.\n\n\"They have a much harder time surviving to adulthood than females,\" said Mark Lotz, panther biologist for the FWC. \"So that is why we see some of these males getting picked off so quickly.\"\n\nA few younger males defend themselves successfully. Others head north, accounting for the occasional sightings of panthers near Orlando. But even if only two or three make it, biologists say, they may still contribute to the gene pool.\n\nEven the panther released in Palm Beach County can be considered a success, Lotz said. He proved to be a competent hunter, killing a coyote on his first night in the wild and taking down enough prey after that to survive. When discovered near death, he was found with scars on his face, evidence of surviving fights with other panthers.\n\n\"The fact that he had been in a fight and survived indicates that he was \"man enough\" to stand up to other panthers and walk away wiser to panther hierarchy and protocols which would serve him well later in life,\" Lotz said.'"

            "title": "Historic pact to slow global warming is celebrated in Paris",
            "text": "\tLE BOURGET, France - Nearly 200 nations adopted the first global pact to fight climate change on Saturday, calling on the world to collectively cut and then eliminate greenhouse gas pollution but imposing no sanctions on countries that don't.\n\nThe \"Paris agreement\" aims to keep global temperatures from rising another degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) between now and 2100, a key demand of poor countries ravaged by rising sea levels and other effects of climate change.\n\nLoud applause erupted in the conference hall after French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gaveled the agreement. Some delegates wept, others embraced.\n\n\"It's a victory for all of the planet and for future generations,\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, adding that the pact will \"prevent the worst, most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening.\"\n\nBrazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira added: \"Today, we've proven that it's possible for every country to come together, hand in hand, to do its part to fight climate change.\"\n\nIn the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.\n\nIn practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would have to stop emitting greenhouse gases - most of which come from the burning of oil, coal and gas for energy - altogether in the next half-century, scientists said. That's because the less we pollute, the less pollution nature absorbs.\n\nAchieving such a reduction in emissions would involve a complete transformation of how people get energy, and many activists worry that despite the pledges, countries are not ready to make such profound, costly changes.\n\nThe deal now needs to be ratified by individual governments - at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions - before taking effect. It is the first pact to ask all countries to join the fight against global warming, representing a sea change in U.N. talks that previously required only wealthy nations to reduce their emissions.\n\n\"History will remember this day,\" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. \"The Paris agreement on climate change is a monumental success for the planet and its people.\"\n\nSpeaking from Washington, President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers \"the best chance to save the one planet we have.\"\n\nThe deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 compared with pre-industrial times \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and says they will \"endeavor to limit\" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times.\n\nBen Strauss, a sea level researcher at Climate Central, said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees could potentially cut in half the projected 280 million people whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas.\n\nMore than 180 countries have already presented plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions - a breakthrough in itself after years of stalemate. But those pledges are not enough to achieve the goals in the accord, meaning countries will need to cut much more to meet the goal.\n\n\"We've agreed to what we ought to be doing, but no one yet has agreed to go do it,\" said Dennis Clare, a negotiator for the Federated States of Micronesia. \"It's a whole lot of pomp, given the circumstances.\"\n\nThe agreement sets a goal of getting global greenhouse gas emissions to start falling \"as soon as possible\"; they have been generally rising since the industrial revolution.\n\nIt says wealthy nations should continue to provide financial support for poor nations to cope with climate change and encourages other countries to pitch in on a voluntary basis. That reflects Western attempts to expand the donor base to include advanced developing countries such as China.\n\nIn a victory for small island nations, the agreement includes a section highlighting the losses they expect to incur from climate-related disasters that it's too late to adapt to. However, a footnote specifies that it \"does not involve or provide any basis for any liability or compensation\" - a key U.S. demand because it would let the Obama administration sign on to the deal without going through the Republican-led Senate.\n\nThe adoption of the agreement was held up for nearly two hours as the United States pressed successfully to change the wording on emissions targets from saying developed countries \"shall\" commit to reducing emissions to they \"should.\" Experts said that means the deal probably won't need U.S. congressional approval.\n\nNicaragua said it would not support the pact. Its envoy, Paul Oquist, said the agreement does not go far enough to cut global warming and help the poor countries affected by it.\n\nNicaragua is one of eight participating countries that haven't submitted emissions targets, after Venezuelan envoy Claudia Salerno said her country - which had been holding out - liked the agreement and had submitted its pledge.\n\nThousands of protesters demonstrated across Paris, saying the accord is too weak to save the planet. People held hands beneath the Eiffel Tower and stretched a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile-long) banner from the Arc de Triomphe to the business district La Defense.\n\nKumi Naidoo of Greenpeace said the accord is a good start but isn't enough.\n\n\"Today the human race has joined in a common cause, but it's what happens after this conference that really matters,\" he said. \"This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep.\"\n\nThe accord does represent a breakthrough in climate negotiations. The U.N. has been working for more than two decades to persuade governments to work together to reduce the man-made emissions that scientists say are warming the planet.\n\nThe previous emissions treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, included only rich countries and the U.S. never signed on. The last climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009, ended in failure when countries couldn't agree on a binding emissions pact.\n\nThe talks were initially scheduled to end Friday but ran over as Western powers, tiny Pacific island nations and everyone in between haggled over wording.\n\nThe main dispute centered over how to anchor the climate targets in a binding international pact, with China and other major developing countries insisting on different rules for rich and poor nations. The agreement struck a middle ground, removing a strict firewall between rich and poor nations and saying that expectations on countries to take climate action should grow as their capabilities evolve. It does not require them to do so.\n\nSome scientists who had criticized earlier drafts as unrealistic praised the final pact for including language that essentially means the world will have to all but stop polluting with greenhouse gases by 2070 to reach the 2-degree goal, or by 2050 to reach the 1.5-degree goal.\n\nThat's because when emissions fall, nature compensates by absorbing less carbon dioxide - and can even release old pollution once there's less of it in the air, said Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer. Forests, oceans and soil currently absorb about half the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"It means that in the end, you have to phase out carbon dioxide,\" said John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\nIn addition to the cuts in emissions, the goal could be reached in part by increasing how much carbon dioxide is sucked out of the air by planting forests or with futuristic technology, Oppenheimer said, but added such technology would be expensive.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande welcomed the world to a \"low carbon age,\" saying France is ready to cut emissions even further and increase aid to poor countries that are affected. He challenged all nations to do more.\n\n\"The 12th of December, 2015, will remain a great date for the planet,\" Hollande declared. \"In Paris, there have been many revolutions over the centuries. Today it is the most beautiful and the most peaceful revolution that has just been accomplished - a revolution for climate change.\"'"

            "title": "Ancient DNA could return passenger pigeons to the sky",
            "text": "\tThe last lonely bird of a species that once numbered 3 billion or more died on Sept. 1, 1914. Martha, as she was known, had been the last passenger pigeon since her mate George died in 1910. The last of a social species, she lived out her days in solitary confinement in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo. Her corpse - stuffed and primped - can now be seen at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nBut what if the passenger pigeon could be brought back?\n\nThat's the idea behind de-extinction. Take DNA harvested from specimens stuffed in museum drawers, like Martha. Figure out which genes matter and then use the fast growing field of genetic engineering to edit the DNA of a closely related species into some version of the extinct species. If all goes well, a chimera of the long-lost Martha could be born and, one day, flocks of passenger pigeons could be restored to the regrown eastern North American woodlands.\n\nWould-be de-extinction pioneer Ben Novak is working at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to make this exact scenario come true. A joint venture between the Revive and Restore effort of The Long Now Foundation (an organization dedicated to long-term thinking) and the ancient DNA lab at UC Santa Cruz, Novak's effort is focused on acquiring genetic information from stuffed passenger pigeons and sequencing the genome of the closely related band-tailed pigeon. So far, 32 samples have had the genetic code in their mitochondria sequenced. All of the samples come from birds killed between 1860 and 1898, according to Novak. \"That's right in the range when the bird was going extinct,\" he notes.\n\nOutside efforts have helped as well, including nearly complete sequencing of three individuals that showed passenger pigeons have been through booms and busts before. \"If passenger pigeons survived through several population bottlenecks during their evolutionary history, perhaps we don't need to create billions of them in order for their populations to be sustainable,\" notes paleogenomicist Beth Shapiro of UC Santa Cruz, whose lab hosts Novak and this effort.\n\n\"All of our birds are all very, very similar to each other - like everybody being cousins, essentially - which is the effect of this recent rapid population expansion,\" Novak adds. \"What we're really interested in is figuring out when that population expansion happened.\"\n\nIf the population explosion happened more than 400 years ago, then it is unlikely that the European arrival in North America precipitated the boom that produced billions of birds, as some have suggested. To figure out when the last boom occurred will require finding DNA from fossil samples thousands of years old - a few of which Novak has begun to examine. With ancient samples and those from the 19th century, Novak and his peers could begin to piece together the actual ecology of the bird in the wild. And understanding how the passenger pigeon existed makes it more likely people could bring the bird back and have the species thrive in the woods that are available today as well as in the future as the climate changes. \"Nothing in the data so far to shout at us to turn back now and not bring back the passenger pigeon,\" Novak says.\n\nThe team has not yet completed the band-tailed pigeon sequencing required to begin resurrecting the passenger pigeon, but experiments in cell cultures from the band-tailed pigeon may begin as soon as next year, Novak says. This work would be similar to experiments being done at Harvard Medical School to see if the woolly mammoth might be resurrected through its still-living relative, the Asian elephant. And the passenger pigeon work may be helped along by similar germ cell efforts in the chicken and houbara bustard - a rare bird prized by oil sheikhs with the funds to attempt a genetic rescue.\n\nIf cell cultures thrive and genetic engineering works, the only remaining challenge would then be to teach the resulting hybrid band-tailed and passenger pigeons how to be passenger pigeons. This will likely be even more challenging than the genetic work, given experience from rearing California condors with puppets or teaching cranes to migrate with ultralight airplanes. That's why Revive and Restore, for one, is not putting all its de-extinction eggs in the passenger pigeon basket (as it were). The foundation-funded outfit might undertake a similar effort to revive the heath hen in Martha's Vineyard, if they can get funding from outside donors. But, assuming breeding, sequencing and cell-culture experiments go well, birds that carry the now extinct genes of the passenger pigeon could be flapping around a California facility by the end of the decade, according to Novak.\n\nThese de-extinction projects may prove too ambitious, however. Similar efforts that stretch back 30 years have so far failed to produce a quagga, an extinct species of zebra, although acquiring quagga genetics from museum specimens did kick off the entire ancient DNA field in 1984. And the 2003 experiment that resurrected a bucardo - a goat species that was extinct - for seven minutes has yet to be repeated. Nevertheless, even the International Union for Conservation of Nature has set up a committee to examine how the genetics used for de-extinction might be used to preserve endangered animals and plants or bring them back if they die out.\n\nDe-extinction is not just for extinct species, after all. It could also be used to save a plant or animal that is on the verge of extinction. The black-footed ferret has been bred back from just seven viable individuals in the 1980s to thousands today, but the species may need a genetic transfusion to protect the new animals from the perils of inbreeding, which include reproductive problems, susceptibility to disease and genetic drift. So Revive and Restore has sequenced four ferret genomes, including two that had been stored in cell cultures from deep freeze at the Zoological Society of San Diego for the Frozen Ark Consortium, a global project to save the DNA and viable cells of endangered species. If genetic information from such frozen samples could be used to infuse robust genetics into a living population, it would be a first in the annals of conservation. \"The northern white rhino has only four living individuals left. They are not viable,\" says Ryan Phelan of Long Now, who has petted the last individuals of this functionally extinct species. \"Do we use genomic techniques and advanced genetic technology to keep that species alive or let it march over to the right on the continuum of extinction and become extinct?\"\n\nBut there are advantages to working with an animal that is already extinct, not least of which is the absence of urgency. After all, Martha died 100 years ago. \"If we succeed, the world gets a new organism,\" Novak says. \"If we fail, we learn things that are valuable and the world isn't left with another extinct species.\"\n\n_**Reproduced with permission.

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - The Girl Scout stands shyly on the grassy edge of what, at this moment, is quite possibly the happiest concrete slab in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIt is a basketball court. Not a full court, not even a half court, but enough of a court to hold fallaway jump shots, drives down the lane, and heaps of laughter loud enough to drown out the cars whooshing through the cluttered city streets.\n\nIt is a Thursday after school, and a bunch of kids are joyfully and fearlessly running around the shiny adjustable basket and its nylon net as if they had just emerged from behind locked doors into a long-awaited embrace of endless fresh air -- which they have.\n\nThe court is located in the secluded front yard of a Door of Hope transitional apartment complex for women and children who have been left homeless as a result of domestic violence. The center's location cannot be revealed for security reasons. The 18 children who reside in the 13 apartments in this building can rarely play outside the complex, also for security reasons.\n\nThis court is their private refuge, their daily release, a place one can soar and sprint and shout and still be safe. It has been open only a month yet is already filled every afternoon with kids who can bond over their heartaches and share their dreams.\n\nAll of which makes the Girl Scout look lost. A stray ball rolls to her feet. She bends down and gently tosses it back to the crowd of kids and now they're staring like, what is she doing here?\n\nShe doesn't live here. She no longer plays basketball. She barely even watches basketball. She's 16 years old and standing there wearing one of those little-girl sashes filled with patches and buttons.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Claire Dundee says with a smile. \"People say, 'You're still a Girl Scout? Isn't that for second-graders?'\"\n\nAlso, apparently, for giants.\n\nThe Girl Scout is here not because she's trying to earn a badge by passing out water, leading cheers, or arranging a postgame ice cream social.\n\nThe Girl Scout is visiting the basketball court because she built it.\n\nWith her wits and will, during a six-month period that occasionally seemed like forever, Claire Dundee arranged and supervised the construction of a simple court that has been the answer to endless prayers. She initially did it to earn her Girl Scout Gold Award, that organization's highest honor, but eventually reaped far greater riches, restoring faith in adults skeptical of a teen's determination and hope in kids who didn't have a place to play.\n\nShe raised the money, convinced the contractor, dealt with the architect, eventually even pushed the wheelbarrow. In the beginning, she was so scared to phone strangers that she would write down a script before every call. But by the end, she was overseeing the pouring of the concrete.\n\nOn this recent Thursday afternoon, as Dundee's vision leaps and twirls through gangly boys and toddling princesses, Shaina Clasberry, youth coordinator for Door of Hope, shakes her head.\n\n\"That Girl Scout did way more than sell us cookies,\" she says.\n\nFrom the time she threw a ball at a hoop while sitting atop her father's shoulders, Claire Dundee realized that a basketball court wasn't really about basketball.\n\n\"For me, it was about bonding, sharing, becoming a family,\" she said.\n\nShe and her father and brother would spend long afternoons at the hoop in front of their La Canada home, competing and chatting, keeping score in the usual playground ways.\n\n\"I would judge myself by the lines on the concrete,\" she recalled. \"Each year, I would try to make shots from a line that was farther from the basket.\"\n\nOccasionally she would shoot a ball over the fence into the neighbor's yard. The ball would be returned after being punctured by the neighbor, who would attach a note warning against further intrusions.\n\n\"We would just get another ball and keep shooting,\" she said. \"I couldn't imagine never being able to play whenever I wanted.\"\n\nLast spring, while looking for ideas for her Gold Award, that imagination was sparked when she met with officials from Door of Hope, which provides short-term housing for homeless families and children at three facilities in the Los Angeles area.\n\nDundee was given some of the usual options involving things like building bookcases or planting bushes. When those notions seem to bore her, one of the employees threw out a completely crazy idea: If Dundee really wanted to help, she could turn one of their building's dusty yards into a basketball court.\n\n\"It's a huge need for us to have a space for children to have a safe place to play,\" said Tim Peters, executive director of Door of Hope. \"For kids going through trauma, to be able to do kid things, that's such a big thing.\"\n\nPeters never imagined that the children's space could actually be constructed by a child.\n\n\"We were quite apprehensive whether this Girl Scout could tackle that big of a project,\" he said.\n\nTheir apprehensions were noted. The worries of her parents were heard.\n\nSaid her father Vince: \"I was like, are you sure you know what you're getting into?\"\n\nSaid her mother Judy: \"It was unlikely somebody could do it. But Claire lit up about it.\"\n\nDundee indeed called everyone's bluff, and her aptly named project \"Hoops of Hope\" was born.\n\n\"A lot of people said I was crazy,\" she recalled. \"But I knew something like that would last forever.\"\n\nAnd after all, how hard could it be? Raise some money to buy a goal and some balls, get a contractor to donate a concrete slab, no big deal. She could surely finish it during the summer before embarking on her junior year at Flintridge Prep, right?\n\nNot so fast. Quickly, Dundee discovered that there was nothing in the Girl Scout manual that could guide her through dealings with everything from city hall to a cement mixer.\n\n\"Pretty soon it became obvious that this was going to be overwhelming,\" she said.\n\nShe collected boxes of junk from friends and held a giant rummage sale in a vacant lot. She made $1,700\\\\. She needed more. She personally called everyone's parents she knew, read from her script and begged them for donations. She collected another $2,000\\\\. She could now buy equipment and help supplant the labor donation of a volunteer contractor.\n\nShe thought the hard part was over. She was wrong.\n\nIt turns out, the city had specifications that had to be handled by the building's owner and architect. The city wasn't wild about putting a half-sized basketball court in anybody's front yard. The emails and phone calls kept piling up with little results.\n\n\"We thought, this could be great, but there's going to be some big hurdles here,\" said Mark Trueblood, a board member of the Verdugo Housing Corp., which owns the building. \"Claire was very impressive, but I think this was less than a 50-50 proposition.\"\n\nYet Dundee stayed up late every night sifting through emails and poking and prodding and reminding everyone of the importance of their mission. Through this inspiration, Trueblood and Richard Dell, principal of the RED Architectural Group, continued to push officials until they finally relented.\n\nSaid Dell: \"I was blown away by her vision. We're always so focused on fixing the building, and she was like, 'Wait, we need something fun for kids.'\"\n\nSaid Trueblood: \"Claire hung on and wouldn't let go.\"\n\nNow she just needed to actually build it. The initial contractor failed to show up, so another script was written, another phone call was made, this time to a contractor who had previously done some business with her father.\n\n\"That's the first time I've ever met a Girl Scout,\" recalled a chuckling Mansour Jahanbin of Oxford Construction, based in Irvine, California. \"I was so impressed to see her coming at me from so far outside the box. It's amazing that a 16-year-old girl would think like that.\"\n\nThe project required nearly three weeks, with five workers, at a donated cost of about $25,000, and was run by a most unusual foreman. Dundee would show up every day after school to check on everything from grading to concrete while pulling weeds and planting bushes.\n\n\"She was my boss,\" Jahanbin said. \"It was one of those projects that you start at a certain level, and it keeps getting bigger, but it was such a good thing, and she was so impressive, you can't stop, you've got to finish it.\"\n\nFinally, on Dec. 22, in a light rain, a ribbon was cut, and a dozen kids splashed out to the court to celebrate its creation. Of course, for the occasion, the Girl Scout brought cookies. Only this Girl Scout baked them herself.\n\n\"It was my favorite part of the project, seeing the kids fight over the balls and run out there and just start shooting,\" Dundee recalled. \"I just stood back and watched. It was really something.\"\n\nConsidering the amount of young pain that they see coming across their threshold every day, the Door of Hope folks were even more impressed.\n\n\"It's amazing that a kid can have an idea and end up serving other kids in the community,\" said Nicole Peters, development associate of Door of Hope. \"It gives me faith in humanity.\"\n\nYet the Girl Scout has stayed in the background, no initials carved in the concrete, no plaque anywhere, Dundee leaving no personal mark on the court other than her sweat. In fact, she says she's not even finished, as she insists on painting the court green and adding official lines once it dries from the recent rains.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if I did it, it matters that it's there,\" Dundee said. \"That's all that's important.\"\n\nHer impact could be found Thursday in an 11-year-old named Arman, who had been running up and down the small court with huge beads of sweat and a tired smile.\n\n\"Before this, I would be in my apartment, bored, doing nothing,\" Arman said. \"Now I can get out all of my Laker gear and wear it and play in it. Now it's like I'm really home.\"\n\nOn another part of the court, Susana, a current resident, said Dundee's influence was visible in the expression of her 11-year-old son Jonathan.\n\n\"I can see a smile on his face, a change in him, he can come downstairs and just play and be a kid,\" she said. \"Who knew a court could be so important?\"\n\nStanding quietly on the sidelines of her wonderfully raucous miracle, with a grin as sweet as a Thin Mint, the Girl Scout knew.'"

            "text": "\tMuch of what we know about how chimpanzees behave is thanks to one person: Jane Goodall.\n\nGoodall has spent decades in the eastern African nation of Tanzania observing chimpanzees, and a new book, \"Untamed: The Wild Life of Jane Goodall,\" is filled with vibrant photos and stories of her life and her important discoveries.\n\nSeveral other children's books have been published about Goodall because of her work in primatology, which is the study of mammals such as apes and monkeys. But the author of \"Untamed,\" Anita Silvey, wanted to write this book because it covers the 81-year-old scientist's career up through the present. \"Her entire life fascinated me,\" Silvey says.\n\nThe book begins with Goodall's childhood in England, where she was a keen observer of her many pets and of other local animals. She loved being in nature and reading such books as \"The Story of Doctor Dolittle,\" which is about a veterinarian who travels to Africa and learns to communicate with animals.\n\nSilvey, who is an expert in children's literature, says, \"A lot of reading in childhood is about thinking, 'Is this a road map for my life? Is there something I can learn here that's actually a way for my life to go?' \"\n\nWhen she was in her early 20s, Goodall got an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa. She became obsessed with the idea and worked hard to earn enough money to get there. Silvey says, \"I don't think that's what many other people would do.\"\n\nOnce she was in Africa, Goodall quickly got herself a job with Louis Leakey, a famous scientist who was studying humans' early development. He encouraged her and helped her study chimpanzees in the wild.\n\nAt the Gombe Stream Game Reserve (now a national park) in Tanzania, Goodall transformed the scientific research of animals. Silvey says Goodall \"focused on chimpanzees as individuals, with distinct personalities. At the time, the scientific community recorded animals as numbers - she insisted that every individual chimp mattered and every one was unique.\"\n\nThe book's wonderful photographs, including four pages of a chimpanzee \"family scrapbook,\" provide a sense of the animals' distinct personalities and reveals the trusting relationships Goodall developed with many of the chimps she studied.\n\nSilvey makes it clear that Goodall faced many difficulties: \"It wasn't easy for her, but she is somebody who overcomes the next obstacle. Whatever it is, she finds a solution.\"\n\n\"It's not that everyone can have Jane Goodall's story,\" Silvey says. \"But her story tells kids that if you love something, if you really want something, you can have an impact on the world. She took a childhood passion and made it into a career and the cause of her life.\"\n\nGoodall has traveled the world working to improve the treatment of chimpanzees and other great apes. Throughout \"Untamed,\" Silvey offers suggestions on helping endangered animals and addressing other problems. Says Silvey, \"I tried to incorporate both some simple things and some more significant ways for kids to get involved.\"\n\nAs Goodall writes in the book's introduction, \"You make a difference every single day. And you get to choose what sort of difference you want to make.\"'"

            "text": "\tKALAPANA, Hawaii - On an overcast Monday afternoon, Aku Hauanio is seated on a picnic table in front of his Uncle Robert's house - one of the few structures in town spared 25 years ago by Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes in the world.\n\nA red cinder trail leads from the heart of this small enclave through a plain of billowing, rock-hard pahoehoe lava to the ocean. Ferns grow in deep crevasses. Coconuts brought by visitors have sprouted and struggle to grow in the inhospitable ground. Waves crash.\n\nHauaino remembers his verdant, pre-volcano beach town on the east end of the Island of Hawaii as \"just one of the beautifulest places on the island. So beautiful it's hard to explain. Everything was like plentiful down here. Fish, fruits, everything. Not much people, just a couple Hawaiian families lived down here.\"\n\nHe often refers to the lava flow as \"da ting,\" as in, \"Da ting just came down all over here.\" He watched it in 1991 as it devoured the house where he was born and raised and where his father still lived when the lava made its gradual way to the coast.\n\nHe remembers being a 2 a.m. spectator as the molten flow entered the house through the back, took down the water tank and set the modest structure ablaze.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey documented the eruption of Kilauea and the lava's fierce path through 180 homes in Kalapana: \"Slow-moving pahoehoe lava gradually spread through the community,\" the agency reported, \"burning homes and covering parks, roads and gardens.\"\n\nA generation later and 12 miles up the road lies Pahoa, in whose general direction Kilauea has now directed its molten wrath. An oozing, burning plume has been advancing toward the town of 950 residents from the volcano's east rift zone since June, claiming its first home on Nov. 10 and threatening to cleave the eccentric enclave in two.\n\nThe lava moves in fits and starts, advancing for a few days, then stalling for weeks. Pahoa's supermarket and drugstore shut down in December when it seemed the flow was nearing. But then it stopped. The drugstore reopened. Other retailers are preparing to do the same.\n\nWhat to do? Hauanio and others still living down the road in Kalapana already know the answer: Wait. Watch. Then move.\n\nWhen his father's house was burned by the lava that night in 1991, Hauanio, 62, a former Hawaii Volcanoes National Park employee, remembers watching in stunned amazement with his former wife. \"We just was like, 'Wow.' And then we went home,\" he said.\n\nMuch of the town already was a crisp, black moonscape of hardened lava. But Hauanio was determined to stay.\n\nHis own house was safe for the moment, but Hauanio was resigned to the fact that it would be next to go. His children, however, weren't. They begged him to move the structure to secure ground, the way parishioners had relocated the nearby Star of the Sea Catholic church months earlier.\n\nHe persuaded a friend with a bulldozer to widen the narrow approach to his threatened house. He hired a crew with a strong lowboy trailer. A week after his childhood home burned, he rolled his current house two miles up the road.\n\nThe lava arrived the next day.\n\nThe lava, he said, \"flows like water, but it's not. Everything's burning. There's a lot of crackling. You no can hear bubbles (of lava) popping, but you can see 'em. It's just like a big pond.\"\n\nKalapana was once home to a famous black sand beach and a historic Hawaiian village. It is now a perfect geological specimen of pahoehoe.\n\nThere are two main kinds of lava: pahoehoe and aa. The latter, said Janet Babb, a geologist with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, is \"jagged and rubbly\" and can be found high on the slope above Kalapana.\n\nThe lava that covers the beach here is an outdoor pahoehoe exhibit worthy of a natural history museum. There are many variations, Babb said - \"ropy, wrinkled, billowy, slabby, sticky, glassy\" - and most all of them are to be found here on the southeast edge of the Big Island.\n\nThere are pillowed stretches broken by what Babb describes as the flow's inflation. \"Think about how the surface of a cream puff cracks if you insert too much cream in the center: Same idea with the lava flow.\"\n\nAnd there are vast lengths of perfectly twisted lava ropes, shiny swirls with an angry beauty. The ropes are formed when the lava's crust begins to harden but molten rock below is still moving, pushing the solidifying top into wrinkles, much like a spatula pushing scrambled eggs in a pan.\n\nToday, Kapalana is lovely in its own way, said Hauaino, who still lives in the house he rescued from the flow a quarter of a century ago.\n\nWhen he thinks about the on-again, off-again threat to Pahoa, he is philosophical. If you live in Pahoa, he said, you always have to be ready to move.\n\n\"The whole island is made out of lava, yeah?\" he said. \"You cannot do anything. You cannot cry. When the lava comes, you just gotta take what's important to you and just move out of the way.\"'"

            "text": "\tDALLAS - Brian Boone is practicing his silly voice. The 39-year-old soldier, who lost his lower left leg while serving in Afghanistan, looks down at Brindle, a 2-year-old Labrador-golden retriever mix - and highly trained service dog.\n\n\"Good boy,\" says Boone. Sarah Koch, Brindle's trainer, looks on. \"I want you to get a little silly with your praise,\" she says. Boone tries again. \"Goooooood booooooooy,\" he coos. Brindle looks up with doe eyes at his new master and looks all too pleased with himself.\n\nBrindle and Boone are one of four teams united through a partnership between Canine Companions for Independence and Baylor Scott and White Health in Irving, Texas. They believe it's the first partnership between a service dog organization and a health care system in the United States, says Corey Hudson, CEO of Canine Companions.\n\nIt costs $50,000 to train each service dog. Canine Companions, based in Santa Rosa, California, typically provides the service free of charge. In the new partnership, Baylor Scott and White Health finds patients who could benefit from having a service dog, covers the cost of training the dogs and their owners, and supports them once they are home.\n\nThere's a need for service dogs among their patients, says Joel Allison, CEO of Baylor Scott and White Health. \"It ties in to our mission,\" he says. \"We think of it as part of our commitment to serve and meet the needs of all the patients that we serve.\"\n\nMore than 25,000 Americans use service dogs, according to Assistance Dogs International, a coalition of assistance dog organizations. The animals are trained to help children and adults living with physical and mental disabilities.\n\nSome service dogs are able to sense oncoming seizures and protect their owners from falls. Others help the visually impaired. Dogs raised by Canine Companions are trained to pull wheelchairs, pick keys off the floor and tug off clothes.\n\nThe Baylor-Canine Companions partnership began this week by training four clients. The group plans to expand to 60 clients next summer when a specially built facility with six rooms and 24 kennels will open in Irving.\n\nBoone is thrilled at his prescription for a dog. Lower back pain makes it difficult for him to pick things up, and he hopes Brindle will save him \"lots of wear and tear\" on his back.\n\nRecently, Boone was one of four Texans being matched with a service dog. He was joined by Stacey Odom, 45, a special education teacher; Melanie Knecht, 24, a music therapy intern; and Mackenzie Dunckelman, 13.\n\nThey were selected from hundreds of applicants because their physical needs matched the help that Canine Companion service dogs can offer.\n\nThe Texas location saves Boone and his classmates a trip to Canine Companions' Southwest region campus in Oceanside, California, for the weeklong training. \"When they told me that pretty much everything was here right now that just was even more amazing,\" Boone says.\n\nHe says he heard about Canine Companions through a friend at the Center for the Intrepid at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, a program for soldiers who have suffered burns or amputations.\n\n\"That friend has the same injury as me,\" he says. \"He's a below-the-knee amputee, and I saw how well-behaved and helpful his dog was.\"\n\nBoone was an explosives ordnance disposal officer when he was injured in 2011. \"It's like the Army bomb squad,\" he says. \"We took care of improvised explosive devices.\"\n\nIt was an IED that severed his left leg and damaged nerves in both of his shoulders.\n\nBoone was unable to use his right arm for a year. Months of rehabilitation and physical therapy helped him regain some strength, but he hopes that working with Brindle will make him even stronger.\n\nOne recent morning, in a long classroom at Baylor Health Center at Irving-Coppell, Brindle is joined by four other Labrador-golden retriever mixes. (The fifth dog serves as a backup in case one of the other dogs doesn't pass muster.) All sit silently in their kennels at the edge of the room looking out at Boone and his three classmates.\n\nA bark would mean instant failure. Only 40 percent of the dogs raised by Canine Companions graduate from the nine-month training program. The dogs that make it to Texas are the cream of the crop.\n\nNot everyone in the classroom needs a service dog for themselves. Stacey Odom, a special education teacher from Bullard, hopes a service dog will facilitate her work with autistic children.\n\nOdom is the first to volunteer for the drills that Koch asks the class to practice. The service dogs are taught at least 40 commands and the new students must learn the proper sequence of words to help the dogs respond.\n\n\"Illia. Down. Don't! Down. Good girl!\" says Odom to Illia, a shiny black dog. \"I just want to cuddle her,\" says Odom. She fights the urge and instead asks Illia to obey a second command. Illia obeys and eagerly plants herself on the schoolteacher's foot.\n\nOdom and Boone have waited more than seven months for this opportunity. They're the lucky ones. Canine Companions receives more than 100 applications a month, says Simi Balter, program manager at the organization's Southwest regional office.\n\n\"We get to witness small miracles,\" says Balter. She recalls a child with learning difficulties who, having never spoken before, uttered his first word to a service dog. Then there was the stroke victim who moved a previously paralyzed arm to stroke a service dog.\n\nBoone isn't asking for a miracle. But he says it's not just physical tasks that Brindle will help him with - it's the mental task of healing. \"Dogs are very soothing,\" he says. \"Especially these calm dogs. Just being around them brings your spirit up. That's hard to beat.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Among the tall towers and tourists crowding Chicago's Magnificent Mile is an often overlooked population - homeless people with signs asking for change.\n\nWhile many of the cardboard signs seem hastily scribbled, over the past months many of them have been revamped and replaced, a project by a Chicago art student who hoped  beautiful lettering would stand out amid the hustle and bustle of Michigan Avenue.\n\n\"My hope was that the Chicago project would create some awareness around the homeless,\" said Ian Todd, the man behind the hand-lettered signs. \"And also that people would be more inclined to talk when they walk by, and more willing to give.\"\n\nTodd, 23, said recently he was struck by the vast number of Chicago's homeless when he moved to the city from California to study at the Chicago Portfolio School, which focuses on advertising and design.\n\n\"It was a bit shocking seeing all the homelessness,\" he said. \"I was taking a class on expressive type, and after seeing someone hold a cardboard sign, I thought a well-designed one could grab people's attention.\"\n\nTodd first approached homeless people in April, asking whether they wanted new signs. Some refused, but others acquiesced and Todd got to work. He finished about 20 signs in two months and said the complexity of the lettering meant one sign took anywhere from five to 10 hours to complete. He started a blog called \"The Urban Type Experiment\" documenting his experience making the signs, which quickly went viral.\n\nThe signs, all of which are photographed on his blog, tell varying stories of turmoil, from a single father struggling to support three children to a woman offering work so she can afford a bus ticket home. Todd kept in touch with many of the sign recipients and said while some had success, not all of the signs brought an uptick in charity.\n\nMike Droney, 54, was holding one of Todd's signs on Michigan Avenue on a recent sunny afternoon. The aging piece of cardboard read: \"I lost my leg for my country. Please help, you will be blessed.\"\n\nDroney, who has been homeless for six years, said he lost his leg fighting in Somalia. He sits in front of a Starbucks coffee shop most days asking for money, and said the only real assistance he gets is medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nDroney said he often gets accolades about the sign, but it is hard to quantify whether the lettering is really doing much.\n\n\"People compliment me on it, you know, so it might help, in a way,\" he said. \"I can't really say.\"\n\nUlysses White, 54, also has one of Todd's signs and said it has resulted in more charity. White said he served two tours in Iraq, and his sign makes mention of his service before saying: \"Anything is appreciated. Thank you for your generosity.\"\n\nWhite got his customized piece of cardboard after being introduced to Todd by one of his homeless friends who already had a sign.\n\n\"The new sign has helped, most definitely, a whole lot,\" White said. \"He made signs for a whole bunch of people along Michigan Avenue.\"\n\nTodd's project is not the first of its kind. In 2011, the Chicago Tribune newspaper profiled Christopher Devine, who was printing and laminating signs for the homeless. Devine's signs were much simpler than Todd's, printed on white paper in bold Helvetica font with text declaring \"Homeless\" or \"Please Help.\"\n\nDevine, 32, said recently that he printed nearly 700 signs over the past four years of the project and just stopped distributing signs a few months ago. He said he has seen Todd's artwork on the street and was happy to see another project aimed at increasing the visibility of the homeless population.\n\n\"They are far more elaborate and intricate than the plain Helvetica signs - they are eye-catching,\" he said. \"The important part of both projects is that the signs are different aesthetically than your typical homeless sign.\"\n\nWhile Devine's project got mixed reactions, including some who said the signs denigrated the homeless, Devine said the project was successful in his eyes. He said a flood of donations came in following the story to help cover his laminating costs.\n\n\"There were a number of people who were against the concept of the project,\" he said. \"The point is, yesterday they weren't talking about homelessness, and today they are.\"\n\nEd Shurna, executive director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said that while the revamped signs may help some in the homeless community, Chicago's homeless problem requires systemic action. He said the homeless population is the largest in recent memory, adding that 6,000 people fill the city's shelters each night.\n\n\"It's getting worse, is all I can say,\" Shurna said. \"You see more people on Lower Wacker (Drive), more people on the lakefront. It's escalating.\"\n\nShurna said Gov. Bruce Rauner's budget priorities would reduce care services for poor people and exacerbate the problem of homelessness throughout Illinois.\n\n\"If the cuts being proposed at the state level continue, you are going to see shelters closing,\" Shurna said. \"There is going to be a big increase in homelessness, and even now the shelters aren't sufficient.\"\n\nTodd, who graduated from the Chicago design school in May, moved to Los Angeles a few weeks ago to begin an advertising internship. He said he notified his homeless friends before he left that he would no longer be able to make signs for them. While he said his new job keeps him busier than when he was in school, he didn't rule out making signs for California's homeless.\n\n\"Homelessness is definitely here,\" Todd said. \"I wouldn't mind getting something started.\"'"

While Memorial's program is specifically geared toward keeping children active, both the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and Miami Children's Hospital offer comprehensive programs for children who are obese or at-risk of becoming overweight.\n\nThe idea is to encourage healthy eating and exercise as early as possible to prevent health problems later on. They say parents need to introduce fruits and vegetables and limit television and computer time so it becomes part of a child's routine.\n\n\"It's a serious problem and can only get worse,\" said Dr. William Muinos, who heads the Weight Management Program at Miami Children's Hospital. \"It's all about health.\"'\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of every three children is obese. The number has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, the CDC reports.\n\nMuinos sees about 30 children every Friday as part of the Weight Management Program. Muinos works to create individualized plans based on the age of the child and height and the child's body mass index. Growing children are placed in a percentile based on their age and gender.\n\nHe said in extreme cases, he has worked with children who have had to lose more than 100 pounds. While he works to get the children to understand the importance of losing weight, he knows he also has to make sure the family is on-board.\n\n\"A child cannot do it by themselves,\" he said. \"The parent has to make the commitment.\"\n\nHe starts by encouraging vegetables and reducing starchy food from the child's diet. He also develops a \"doable\" exercise plan that can be anything from walking to going to the gym.\n\n\"We have to make sure it's something a child will stick with,\" he said.\n\nMuinos said most of the time getting a kid on track means changing behavior completely. He said today's world of fast food, television and video games contributes to the \"epidemic.\"\n\n\"This is a societal issue,\" he said.\n\nFor Jose Carlos Sanchez, the past two months have been a complete change in lifestyle. He was referred to Muinos by his pediatrician because the 14-year-old weighed nearly 250 pounds. He has already lost about 20 pounds and is motivated to continue down the right path.\n\n\"I feel much better about myself,\" said Sanchez, who lives in Hialeah, Florida, and is going into the eighth grade. \"I have a lot more energy.\"\n\nHis mom, Mayelin Govea, said she is very happy that the doctor was able to get her son's weight under control.\n\n\"He didn't like fruit or salad,\" she said in Spanish. \"He didn't want to exercise.\"\n\nNow she takes him to the gym several times a week and he plays basketball with his friends.\n\n\"I see a big change in him,\" she said.\n\nMiami Children's Hospital also has a 10-week program for overweight Latino teen girls called Healthy Chicas. The two-hour-long sessions include exercise and nutrition education and cooking instruction. The sessions have an adolescent medicine doctor and a nutritionist.\n\nAt the University of Miami's Batchelor Children's Research Institute, Dr. Tracie Miller screens children and then puts them on a plan that includes healthy eating and exercise. She starts by explaining how excess weight can affect each organ.\n\n\"It's very important that we understand what is going on in the inside,\" she said. Children who are referred to the program, dubbed Crunchtime, are monitored closely during the nine-month program.\n\nThe children are given a bone-density scan, put on a nutrition plan and are given a comprehensive fitness evaluation. The first three months are the strictest.\n\n\"The idea is to go hard and fast in the beginning,\" said Miller. \"Really, the hardest part is just getting started.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, fun is key, said Miller.\n\nAt the exercise class at Memorial West, many of the children didn't even realize how hard they were working.\n\nDickenson, who teaches the class, said he tries to make it like a club with popular music and includes games so \"they can be kids.\" He creates a high-endurance and high-cardio class by using hula hoops, sliders, weights and balls.\n\n\"I make it a rock star-type atmosphere and the kids get into it,\" he said. \"By the end of the class they are all sweating.\"\n\nViana Espinal, 7, said when she is done she \"feels good\" about herself.\n\n\"I worked hard,\" she said, her face red from the workout. She likes the music and the games.\n\nHer grandmother, Ana Espinal, who uses the gym every day, said while her granddaughter is visiting her for the summer from New York, she can't have her sitting around all day.\n\n\"It's not good for her,\" she said. \"She needs to get some energy out.\"\n\nFor Linnea Martinez, the class is a great outlet for her three sons to get used to physical activity. Martinez said she is a former ballerina and often goes to the gym.\n\n\"I want them to be strong and confident,\" she said of her three boys, who are 7, 9 and 10. \"And they are boys, they need to run off some of that energy.\"'"

            "title": "Japanese fisherman in post-tsunami town sees hope in \"dream oysters\"",
            "text": "\tOGATSU, Japan - After pulling on his army-green fisherman's overalls, Hiromitsu Ito crams a cigarette between his lips and guns the throttle on his boat, steering it out into the waters that have sustained and betrayed him.\n\nFive minutes offshore, he idles along some buoys. His rotund nephew and a 17-year-old apprentice haul in a net. Ito grabs a shell bigger than a man's palm, opens it with a rusty blade, and quickly rinses it with seawater. \"Yume-gaki,\" he says, foisting the shell on two visiting city slickers. \"Dream oyster. Try it!\"\n\nOysters, scallops, mussels and sea squirts thrive here in Ogatsu Bay, which bends like a crooked finger more than a mile inland from Japan's northeastern coast. Ito's father plied this inlet, and his grandfather too. Four years ago, Ogatsu had 300 such salty dogs among its population of 4,300.\n\nBut Ogatsu was one of the towns closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 9 earthquake that jolted Japan in March 2011. An 80-foot-high tsunami roared up the bay, swallowing the community and demolishing a hospital, schools and 80 percent of the homes. Three hundred people died here, among 15,890 victims nationwide.\n\nSince then, across northern Japan hundreds of thousands of tons of debris have been cleared away and disposed of. Hundreds of miles of roads have been rebuilt, as have 95 percent of damaged hospitals and 96 percent of damaged schools. Ports and sea walls have been reconstructed and fishing boats replaced.\n\nBut officially, about 220,000 people are still classified as displaced or evacuated and have yet to return to permanent homes. The recovery rate for the fishery and food processing industry lags behind those of all other sectors, according to Japan's Reconstruction Agency.\n\nIn backwaters such as Ogatsu, the going has been particularly tough.\n\nOnly about 800 residents have returned, among them about 70 fishermen. The town, whose neat homes once hugged the hills circling its little harbor, looks like a vacant lot. There is no gas station, no restaurant, not even a mini-mart.\n\nIto lost his house and three boats but has refused to give up. He has been on a quest to find a way, any way, to bring his town and its fishery industry back to life.\n\n\"I feel like it's my mission,\" he says on a gray Sunday in February, his 54th birthday. \"No one told me to do it, but someone has to do it.\"\n\nFor the first six months after the disaster, Ito drove supplies every day to Ogatsu from Sendai, a metropolis two hours to the southwest. After that, he and some other fishermen got back to the water, sharing the few boats they had and cultivating oysters.\n\nThey tried attracting tourists with fishing expeditions and launched a support-the-locals program that rewarded donors with seafood. They dubbed the enterprise Oh! Guts!, a play on Ogatsu's name, with a clenched-fist logo to signal their determination.\n\nFor a while, interest ran high. Journalists from around Japan and the world came, even students from Harvard Business School. But outsiders' attention eventually waned. \"We thought we could develop some tourism here, but we couldn't,\" he says. \"In the end, we were 15 million yen (nearly $125,000) in the red.\"\n\nDream oysters are part of his latest, perhaps more sustainable, undertaking: a sea-to-table business ending at his restaurant in Sendai. Four years ago, yume-gaki didn't exist - at least not with that name. Ito, though, has trademarked the moniker for these oversize Kumamoto oysters raised in Ogatsu Bay.\n\nTypically, they're 4 years old and must be 9.8 ounces or more to qualify as a yume-gaki.\n\n\"They're called yume-gaki because it's about the dream of recovery,\" says Ito, whose masculine gruffness frequently yields to a sweet idealism.\n\nThe tsunami did more than rearrange the physical landscape; it upended relationships. Initially, communities pulled together and rallied; later, petty jealousy grew and old grudges flared, relationships fractured.\n\n\"Many things got tangled up. You'd think it'd be easy for people from a place like Ogatsu to just go live elsewhere, but it's tough,\" says Ito, whose two daughters wound up divorcing after the tsunami.\n\nBut other things changed for the better.\n\nIto had wanted to create a sea-to-table business before the disaster, but the entrenched system that in effect obligated fishermen to sell their catch through the fishery association and other middlemen was too powerful.\n\n\"Before the tsunami, people felt that they couldn't say they wanted to join our group,\" he says. \"But now, the atmosphere has changed. In the tsunami, we lost physical things, but gained new ideas and new attitudes.\"\n\nBy paying fishermen double or even triple the rate they'd get selling to middlemen, Ito's outfit, Kai-you, has attracted a network of willing suppliers, sometimes taking in 2 tons of seafood a day. Kai-you handles the cleaning and distribution, selling directly to 350 restaurants across Japan (while paying the fishery association a small fee to not make waves).\n\nThere are still challenges. Though Ogatsu is far north of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and has had no harmful radiation in its products, Kai-you still can't sell to South Korea, which stopped buying seafood from northeastern Japan because of fear of contamination.\n\nNevertheless, in November, Ito cinched the final link in his chain. With a $350,000 bank loan, he opened Ostra de Ole, a 32-seat oyster bar on a busy corner in Sendai. (Ito, who has a penchant for bilingual wordplay, explains that the Spanish name also conveys the idea of \"My Oysters\" in Japanese.)\n\nOne recent Saturday night, Ito traded his rubber waders for a crisp white shirt and a dapper black vest. Patches of gray poked through his black mane. He roamed the restaurant, greeting customers and keeping an eye on his waitstaff. \"Try this yume-gaki,\" he encourages one diner, explaining that they take four years to grow so large. \"It was born in the spring of the tsunami.\"\n\nAlthough Kai-you and Ostra de Ole seem to be getting on their feet, whether they are enough to breathe new life into Ogatsu remains deeply uncertain.\n\nJust two new homes have been built in Ogatsu since the disaster. Ito bought a drafty old house up on a bluff that barely escaped the deluge, but is splitting his time between Ogatsu and Sendai, where he's pushing his sales and keeping tabs on the restaurant.\n\n\"I bought this for my parents, but even they don't want to live here,\" he says. His mother, 82, and father, 84, have relocated to the nearby city of Ishinomaki, though his dad still comes around to help clean fishing equipment and do other tasks.\n\nFor now, the house is inhabited by Ito's 17-year-old apprentice, Hayato Yabuuchi, whose father brought him to Ogatsu for some real-world experience after the teen had difficulty in school. After he finishes his daily work classifying oysters by size and packing them, Hayato passes the time writing rap lyrics and keeping a diary.\n\n\"It's a little lonely being here,\" he says. \"There are no other kids my age. I plan to stay a year, but honestly I don't think young people will want to live here. It's scary.\"\n\nOn a hill next to Ito's house stands the long-established Sakura shrine; its name translates as \"creating joy.\" A recently erected sign out front designates the spiritual site as an evacuation spot in case of another disaster.\n\nIto climbs the stairs and ritually rings the overhead bell before sliding open the doors to the small red building. \"I don't come here much,\" he says.\n\nHe motions behind the shrine, to an area with some construction equipment. They're going to build 10 or 15 houses over there, he says, \"but so far, demand is less than supply.\" Also, 15 or so units are going up toward the center of Ogatsu. When those are complete, the population of Ogatsu may climb back to 1,000.\n\nDriving out of Ogatsu in his Mini Cooper, Ito points to a vacant expanse that used to be the site of the elementary school, junior high and some housing. There are plans for a new school, he's heard, but he doubts they will ever come to pass.\n\n\"Before, this was a town,\" he says. \"Now, I don't know what to call it.\"'"

            "title": "In modern-day Kansas, cowboys practice the ancient art of the roundup",
            "text": "\tKANSAS CITY, Mo. - Jake Betts looked every bit a cowboy as he tugged the reins of a horse named Leroy and jangled up a ridge.\n\nHe wore Levi's, wrapped with leather chaps. Cowboy boots with spurs. Rope coiled off the side of his saddle. Cattle in the distance, almost 1,100 head to be driven on this day earlier this week.\n\nAnd all went well until Leroy bucked and Betts fell backward onto some rocks. The crew laughed for the rest of the day as the aching cattleman winced watching cows march into tractor trailers.\n\n\"I'll be fine if I can just make it through the shipping season,\" Betts said.\n\nIt's that time of year - late July, the shipping season - when the Flint Hills cowboys saddle up.\n\nMeet the modern-day wrangler: Betts and 10 other cowboys and cowgirls commenced this roundup at the first break of light.\n\nThe bovines they corral are speckled across a vast, spectacular stage. For the last four months, the cows have munched on a thick carpet of native bluestem grasses.\n\nAnd in keeping with Old West tradition, they're rounded up by men, women and children on horseback, not in the four-wheelers or pickups that many ranchers favor.\n\n\"For 50 years - since about 1890, actually - we've been talking about the disappearing cowboy,\" said James F. Hoy, director of Emporia State University's Center for Great Plains Studies and an author of books on Kansas history.\n\n\"But if you get off the interstate a ways, cowboys are still out there. They don't carry a pistol anymore in their holster. Now, it's a cellphone,\" he said.\n\nA cellphone and intricate spreadsheets help Cliff Cole manage the ranching operations here, and they're extensive: A half-dozen caretakers reside on 80,000 acres owned by West Bottoms businessman Bill Haw, who with a Texas partner also owns the cattle - all 40,000 head.\n\nFor Haw's \"contract cowboys,\" the July roundup largely is a family affair. Three generations of the Nelson family, for example, have been herding pretty much the same way, on horseback, for decades.\n\nHolton Nelson, 15, has been helping drive Flint Hills cattle since he was 4.\n\nOlder brother Nate has taken college courses on livestock raising and agribusiness. \"But what we're doing now,\" said Nate Nelson, 25, \"you're not going to learn out of a book.\"\n\nHe whooped, whistled, slapped his thigh and the cows moseyed on when his horse Geronimo trotted up. \"Hup! Hup! Whoo-oh-up!\"\n\nThe Nelsons - Nate's dad Shane is one of Haw's caretakers of the land - have seen plenty of changes in the raising, feeding and shipping of beef stock. But the roundup remains an ancient art, a job that can't be outsourced or, as most of these cowboys see it, carried out any other way.\n\nBy cowboys, that is, wearing long sleeves even in the heat, pointed boots rather than sneakers or work shoes, and jeans no other color than blue.\n\nWhen not herding during the monthlong shipping season, the cowboys and caretakers brand the livestock, administer vaccines and fix fences year-round.\n\nFew get rich doing it.\n\n\"This lifestyle is the opposite of prosperity,\" said operations manager Cole.\n\nMany of those who show for the roundup aren't getting paid, per se. They're neighbors and relatives willing to help so long as the favor is someday returned.\n\nStill, the intangible rewards to them are priceless.\n\nTheir workspace extends to distant horizons. And driving all that cattle is a midsummer sight to behold, performed on slopes so remote, few human eyes but for the cowboys' will view it.\n\nJade Cole, 16, rose at 3:30 this morning to meet her uncle Cliff, the operations' manager, at the edge of a dark dirt road. Sleeping truckers are parked nearby.\n\nOther wranglers, including Betts and the Nelsons, arrive for the roundup, their pickups hauling trailers carrying horses.\n\nSomewhere out in the hills are thousands of head of Mexican-born beef cattle, about a year old, unaware they soon will be herded into 18-wheelers for the third or fourth time in their lives, now destined for the feedlot.\n\nBut you can't hear them. You can't see them. The rising sun is just beginning to paint the sky azure.\n\nA roundup requires daylight - the earlier, the better. In the heat of July, moving cows a few miles can stress them.\n\nEvery pound they shed in their procession to the pens is money lost by the cattleman.\n\nA good cowboy treats the moving herd as precious cargo. \"The calmer they are, the less shrinkage,\" Cliff Cole said.\n\nBut too calm is a problem. A trained eye can spot a droopy, sluggish steer from 100 yards out. That animal will be pulled from the procession and marked, so the feedlot knows to segregate it in case it's sick.\n\nDawn reveals spots of livestock scattered across the Flint Hills vista. The riders take their places. Their horses commence an easy trot, knowing full well how this is done:\n\nApproach a cow. It will move.\n\n\"Hyah! Hep, hep! Tsssh!\"\n\nEach cowboy has a signature command to get wayward cattle to join the parade. None resists.\n\n\"That's their herd mentality,\" says Nate Nelson. \"You get into their little bubbles of safety and they'll start moving, following each other. It's like someone getting into your face. It's uncomfortable for them.\"\n\nThe reflex dates back forever. A cow all by itself is a slow target for predators; they've learned there is safety in numbers. Thus they move as one.\n\nEven when heading off to slaughter.\n\n\"Epp! Epp!\" And now comes a tongue-rolling shriek impossible to spell.\n\nThat's Ryan Gasche directing traffic. \"Ryan's a yelper,\" Betts acknowledges.\n\nThis roundup is complicated by a breeze. Cattle tend to face the wind, and today they are being guided in another direction.\n\nAt 7 a.m. the horses pick up the pace. After a mile-long march, the herd flows shoulder-to-shoulder to the crest of a hill and then breaks into a jog, as if the pens by the side of a road are just where these cows desire to be.\n\nGates swing open and closed.\n\nGene Ernest backs his cattle truck to the far end of a fenced maze, where the cows will ascend a ramp and enter through a rear opening the width of a linen closet.\n\nBefore the beasts clamber up, Ernest arranges the interior passages of a semi-trailer with sides resembling giant cheese graters. He slides back corrugated ramps, directing some cattle upstairs and others downstairs.\n\nSometimes he'll be subjected to a \"hamburger attack,\" when an unruly bunch of bovines pins him behind a swinging door or against the trailer wall.\n\nThe truckers carry their own electrified cattle prods, or \"hot shots,\" to keep the procession from the pens moving in the same direction. A single person standing in the wrong place, even without a prod, can spook cattle and reroute dozens of them at once.\n\n\"Heah! Yah, yah!\"\n\nPounding into the trailer, 26 cows fill the top deck of Ernest's trailer, 26 share the bottom deck and 20 occupy other compartments.\n\nErnest jokes with the cowboys, then climbs into his rig, where his herding dog Skeeter awaits. They'll haul the bawling cargo 50 miles to a Potwin, Kansas, feedlot, then head back for more.\n\n\"I'm 51 and been doing this since I was 18,\" he says before leaving. \"It's the camaraderie I like. That keeps everything going.\"\n\nWhere these cattle were going, the feedlot, they'll enjoy an all-you-can-eat buffet from troughs. This permits a beef cow to bulge from 620 pounds to 1,200 in about 30 weeks.\n\nThen it's on to an Amarillo, Texas, slaughterhouse.\n\nThese cowboys and cowgirls like what they do, though they don't much like talking about it with outsiders.\n\nEspecially not to city folk whose grasp of the beef business is limited to the eating part.\n\n\"We don't like to go to town more than we have to,\" said Cliff Cole, 54. \"Hate to say it this way, but we don't really want to be in close proximity to people.\"\n\nSaid landowner Haw: \"You've heard, 'Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys?' They'll never stay home and they're always alone even with someone they love? That's Willie Nelson singing about these guys.\"\n\nCowboy Gasche, the yelper, recalled a recent getaway to Kansas City with his wife. They arrived on a Friday and aimed to spend the weekend shopping and checking out a Royals game.\n\nBy Saturday morning, Gasche had endured the city long enough. \"We left at 9 a.m.\" and missed the game, he said.\n\nSome of the workers of the Flint Hills ranches boast of understanding cows better than people.\n\nAt an earlier roundup, caretaker Shane Nelson demonstrated.\n\nHe climbed behind the wheel of a Ford F-350 and headed to Lincoln Pasture, one of 14 pastures that he manages.\n\nOn cows:\n\n\"You have to get them to know who you are,\" he said.\n\nHe stopped the pickup, climbed out onto the bed and fired up a generator. An auger spilled over the side of the truck a meal of high-protein pellets roughly the size of wine corks.\n\nReturning to the cab, Shane Nelson crept the truck forward and started honking. The cows took notice.\n\nThe pellets fell and cattle by the hundreds jogged toward Shane Nelson, who kept honking and circling.\n\nHe at this moment was their ice cream man.\n\n\"When we ship these guys tomorrow, they'll follow this truck right out of here,\" he said. \"Yeah, a little like the Pied Piper.\"\n\nSilly cows. If they knew the cowboys better, they'd know this one loves ribeye steak.'"

            "text": "\tATLANTA - On the morning of Oct. 14, 1964, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was out of it.\n\nHe had just returned to Atlanta from a grueling speaking tour, and his appearance was so alarming that his wife, Coretta Scott King, took him to St. Joseph's Infirmary. In admitting him, the doctor lectured King about eating fried foods, told him that he was exhausted, overweight and suffering from both a severe virus and high blood pressure. The doctor gave him sleeping pills.\n\nSo when Coretta called his room that Wednesday morning to tell him he had won the Nobel Peace Prize, King would later say, he thought he was dreaming.\n\n\"I am not even sure that we were aware that he was nominated by the Nobel Prize,\" said Ambassador Andrew Young, one of King's closest confidants. \"So it was a shock. When Coretta called, he said, 'All right,' and hung up the phone. Then he called her back and asked, 'Did you just call me?' She said, 'Yes, you won the Nobel Peace Prize.'\"\n\nKing would be the second African-American and, at the time, the youngest person - at 35 - to win the Peace Prize.\n\nThe honor wasn't just a watershed for King and the civil rights movement, but also for Atlanta. It set off a series of events that some say fundamentally changed the city's business, religious and racial cultures by bringing blacks and whites together for the first time to share a meal in public.\n\nThat simple act, holding a multiracial banquet in the new Nobel laureate's honor, tested the will and even the nerves of those determined to make Atlanta a more just and inclusive place.\n\n\"It was a defining moment in the history of the city, and it should go down in the city's documented memory,\" said Janice R. Blumberg, the widow of Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, who was instrumental in organizing the event.\n\nToday, the prize is in the news for reasons that pain those who celebrated it back then.\n\nKing's three surviving children are due in court in December to determine if the 23-karat gold medal - along with a Bible their father once owned - should be sold at auction. Brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter King, representing the King Estate, plan to sell the items. Sister Bernice King has opposed the sale.\n\nBut even if the story ends in a whimper, this is a day to recall that it started with a bang.\n\nSince at least 1955, when he orchestrated the Montgomery Bus Boycott, King had danced on an ever widening national and international stage. Atlanta, meanwhile, was not exempt from civil unrest but looked progressive compared with Birmingham, Montgomery, Jackson, New Orleans and even Albany.\n\n\"King lived here. The SCLC was headquartered here. The NAACP had a regional office here,\" former Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell said. \"In Atlanta, they were our citizens, and that made a huge difference.\"\n\nBut the races didn't mix, and King was still black. The immediate question became how do you honor the man who was now the city's most recognizable figure?\n\nIn December, while King and his entourage traveled to Norway for the Nobel ceremony, a group of Atlantans debated that question.\n\nThere was talk in the black community about perhaps having a dinner at Paschal's. \"But it was important that he be received by the entire city,\" Young said.\n\nRothschild, the influential rabbi of The Temple, which had been bombed six years earlier by white supremacists, was one of several people who decided to act on that notion.\n\n\"He clearly saw that not only was it the right thing to do, but the only thing to do,\" Blumberg said. \"He was determined that Atlanta would do the right thing. He saw that it would be good for Atlanta to be seen as the progressive city we always thought we were.\"\n\nRothschild, along with Catholic Archbishop Paul Hallinan, Morehouse College President Benjamin E. Mays, Atlanta Constitution editor Ralph McGill and Mayor Ivan Allen, formed a core group of organizers who set their sights on having a huge banquet at the Dinkler Plaza Hotel downtown.\n\nTwo years earlier, the Dinkler had refused to honor the reservation of the first African-American Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ralph Bunche.\n\nMassell, who was president of the Atlanta City Council at the time, recalled it as an \"apprehensive, anxious period.\"\n\nEven after the dinner had been announced and a date set, nobody was buying tickets. Atlanta's powerful business community had refused go along with the idea of the dinner.\n\n\"Some of them may have still been segregationists,\" Blumberg said. \"But things were changing and some of them couldn't see it. They were businessmen and trying to judge what was going to happen to their businesses. They would say, 'It is not good for business. Not yet. Don't go too fast.'\"\n\nIn addition, former Atlanta Journal-Constitution editor David Beasley said, some members of the business community were \"personally opposed to King and the civil rights community in general.\"\n\nKing's reputation with them did not get any better after he got involved in a local labor dispute at the Scripto Pen Company. \"They just seemed to be angry about the Scripto strike and asked why was he getting involved in a local management dispute,\" Beasley said.\n\nYoung believes that the FBI, which had intensified attacks on King after he won the Peace Prize, \"was poisoning the Atlanta community with calls, threats and lies about him,\" even as he was being celebrated abroad.\n\nOn Dec. 16, six days after King had received the Nobel Peace Prize, the banquet organizers sent a letter to Coca-Cola Company baron Robert W. Woodruff, asking him to lend his voice and name to their efforts.\n\n\"The silence was deafening,\" said Beasley, the author of \"Inside Coca-Cola: A CEO's Life Story of Building the World's Most Popular Brand.\"\n\n\"So they sent another letter on Dec. 29, which was the same day an article came out in the paper about the obstacles they were having putting on this dinner. Woodruff probably saw that headline and was concerned that this would be an embarrassment to the city and Coke.\"\n\nMayor Allen and J. Paul Austin, chairman of Coca-Cola, gathered the business elite at the Piedmont Driving Club. Allen warned that he would be taking notes on who did not attend the dinner. But Austin delivered the crushing blow.\n\nAccording to Young's written account, Austin said: \"It is embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be located in a city that refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Company does not need Atlanta. You all have to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Company.\"\n\nTwo hours later, every ticket was sold.\n\nOn the night of Jan. 27, 1965, about 1,500 people packed the Dinkler's chandeliered ballroom to receive King. The event was covered by the world's press.\n\n\"It was a great and delicate moment,\" said Samuel DuBois Cook, a 1948 Morehouse classmate of King's, who attended the dinner. \"Because of the race issue, it could have been very explosive ... It was a turning point, without question.\"\n\nOutside, a few segregationists picketed. Inside, the dinner went off without a hitch. The organizing committee presented King with an engraved Steuben Bowl that Blumberg had designed and ordered.\n\n\"It was one of the most exciting nights of my life,\" Blumberg said. \"It was joyous.\"\n\nThe evening ended with the crowd singing, \"We Shall Overcome.\"\n\n\"It was a good evening that could make all of us proud,\" Massell said. \"But they should have been proud of the award that was received by an Atlantan. Not proud that they had a dinner to honor him.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Four years ago, Mary Visconti took an unconventional approach to keeping her North Lawndale students out of trouble.\n\nThe communities where many of Visconti's students grow up are impoverished, and crime rates are high. In North Lawndale, nearly 40 percent of the residents live under the poverty line, and 30 percent do not graduate from high school, according to the 2010 U.S. census.\n\nVisconti, the CEO of the Better Boys Foundation, decided the dismal data could be combated with something radically different: knitting.\n\n\"Our neighborhood can be chaotic,\" she said. \"It's a hard space to move around in as a young person. I thought that knitting would offer some peace and quiet. It's a refuge where students can create things together and be peaceful, calm and safe.\"\n\nVisconti rounded up donated skeins of yarn and plastic knitting needles, and she hired an art teacher. KnitLAB, a fiber arts workshop, was created.\n\n\"Once the kids got over the trauma of learning to use the needles, they really picked it up,\" Visconti said. \"Part of our logic behind the lab was that they would form a community. The knitters are a tight group.\"\n\nAna Spencer, the instructor for KnitLAB, said many of the students were initially uncomfortable with the craft and struggled to maneuver the needles. Their fingers were clumsy as they fumbled through the rhythmic over-under pattern typical of knitting.\n\n\"At first, it hurt my hands a little bit,\" said Ariana Trimuel, 15. \"You just get used to it. My friends think it's pretty cool, and they're always asking me to make scarves for them. It makes me feel really good to be able to do that.\"\n\nShukurieya McClennon, 13, said it has helped her develop her own sense of style.\n\n\"I don't have to buy things anymore,\" she said. \"I can just make them. At first I was shy about creating and sharing my designs. Now I'm more open to it. Knitting forces you to be open to other ideas.\"\n\nKnitLAB operates like a small business. Students are paid stipends, which total $325 per 10-week session, to create products ranging from hat and scarf sets to rugs and quilts. The funding comes from After School Matters and the Chicago Community Trusts Arts Infusion Initiative. Students are allowed to keep one item each, and the rest are sold. The after-school program's last winter sale brought in $500, Visconti said.\n\nThe money is reinvested in art supplies like yarn and fiber material. The students were each given a portion of the winter sale profit to buy yarn at Loopy Yarns, a business in the South Loop.\n\nSpencer calls the students her \"employees.\" If they call in sick one day, they have to make the time up. She said it instills life skills and gives them a sense of self-efficacy.\n\n\"It's about being proud of yourself when you've finished something and seeing it come to life in your hands,\" Spencer said. \"They're in a generation now where everything is instant. They're on their phones, they're texting and instantly getting a response. With knitting, it can take weeks to finish a single project.\"\n\nThe lab has about 15 kids enrolled in each session. At the end, they can choose to re-enroll. Students have learned to dye yarn vibrant colors with Kool-Aid, weave rugs with strips of ratty old T-shirts and \"knit bomb\" - knit around objects like chairs, handrails and bike racks - portions of the foundation's campus.\n\nOn a gloomy day last month, the students clustered around a folding table in the KnitLAB to create fiber scarves. The room at the foundation is small, and boxes of donated yarn in a rainbow of colors crowd a massive bookshelf. Knitting needles are stuffed haphazardly in vases and cups.\n\nAkenna Mack, 13, laid wispy strands of magenta and orange fibers on a strip of plastic. Artreuna Dotson, 14, rearranged the colors with long, nimble fingers and sprayed them with a soapy solution, setting the design.\n\n\"I thought this would probably be boring at first,\" Akenna said, smoothing a flyaway fiber. \"You think of a grandma sitting in her front room knitting with all her cats. You get the hang of it and it's really fun.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we all love it here,\" Artreuna added. \"I like that we can make stuff. The fact that I could be wearing or using something that I actually made myself is a good feeling.\"\n\nSpencer said many of the students initially felt as though knitting was only for old people, a notion she quickly dispelled.\n\n\"It's actually a serious craft; it's not just for grandmas,\" she said. \"As a kid, especially from this neighborhood, it's important to be able to have the confidence to say, 'I made this.' It's an amazing feeling.\"\n\nWillow Messier, an art therapist and child life specialist at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, said crafts like knitting are important for students - especially teens - as they explore their identity.\n\n\"Teenagers are working on becoming independent and autonomous,\" she said. \"This gives them something to engage in, and the strength to boost confidence and have a product that they can feel proud of. It allows the opportunity for identity-building.\"\n\nIt is even more important for students from at-risk backgrounds to find a sense of stability and quiet, Messier said. Knitting can be that oasis.\n\n\"The actual knitting process is very comforting,\" Messier said. \"You're holding something soft, and you know the specific steps to take. It gives you that sense of control and mastery of what you're doing. For kids from a challenging situation, it can bring a sense of grounding that they can take home with them.\"\n\nDorothea Tobin, a teacher at North Lawndale College Prep, runs a similar program at her school. The knitting club, BT Lives in the Stitch, is a place where students can feel safe and in control, she said. The students are paid about $20 for each item they knit.\n\n\"My favorite thing is seeing kids who haven't really succeeded in other things join,\" Tobin said. \"They come here, learn to knit, and all of a sudden, are very proud. I never suspected so many boys would be doing it. It felt like a real surprise, definitely a plus.\"\n\nVisconti said the number of boys interested in KnitLAB also surprised her. There are usually one to two boys each session.\n\n\"We always joke that it's the smartest boys who sign up for knitting because they're surrounded by girls,\" she said, chuckling. \"Teenage boy life is a lot of strutting and being cool. The quieter boys who don't feel like being in that macho competition go and hang out with the knitters. I think they're equally proud of the things they make.\"\n\nMichael King, 13, learned to sew when he was 11. He said his mother taught him to use a needle and thread so he could mend his much loved teddy bears. It sparked his interest in knitting.\n\nKing said it doesn't bother him that he is in a class filled with girls.\n\n\"Doing this is a different type of motion in your fingers,\" he said, purling a skinny mustard yellow scarf. It was smattered with a few holes, which he pointed out unabashedly. \"I really like it. For knitting, you have to be focused. You can't look away. If you do, you might lose track of what you're doing and it would be a disaster.\"\n\nVisconti said KnitLAB has been a success. It has instilled a sense of pride in her students.\n\n\"The energy they bring is the kind that young people bring anything,\" she said. \"They're excited, they're fresh and they wear the stuff they make. It demonstrates to everyone that they are skilled, creative and have a lot to contribute.\"'"

            "text": "\tLONDON - In a north London hospital, scientists are growing noses, ears and blood vessels in a bold attempt to make body parts in the laboratory.\n\nIt's far from the only lab in the world that is pursuing the futuristic idea of growing organs for transplant. But the London work was showcased Tuesday as Mayor Boris Johnson announced a plan to attract more labs to do cutting-edge health and science research in the area.\n\nWhile only a handful of patients have received the British lab-made organs so far- including tear ducts, blood vessels and windpipes - researchers hope they will soon be able to transplant more types of body parts into patients, including what would be the world's first nose made partly from stem cells.\n\n\"It's like making a cake,\" said Alexander Seifalian at University College London, the scientist leading the effort. \"We just use a different kind of oven.\"\n\nBritish authorities have invested nearly 4 million pounds ($6.7 million) in the plan to stimulate research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area. It aims to attract companies to the area to foster collaboration and promote research and manufacturing. A major center for biological research will open in London next year.\n\nUniversity College London is a partner in the campaign. During a recent visit to his lab there, Seifalian showed off a sophisticated machine used to make molds from a polymer material for various organs.\n\nLast year, he and his team used that material to mold a nose for a British man who lost his to cancer. Then they added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to mimic the somewhat sponge-like texture of a natural nose. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the nose scaffold. Later, the nose was implanted into the man's forearm so that skin would grow to cover it.\n\nSeifalian said he and his team are waiting for approval from regulatory authorities to transfer the nose onto the patient's face but couldn't say when that might happen.\n\nThe polymer material Seifalian uses for his organ scaffolds has been patented and he's also applied for patents for their blood vessels, tear ducts and windpipes. He and his team are creating other organs including coronary arteries and ears. Later this year, a trial is scheduled to start in India and London to test lab-made ears for people born without them.\n\n\"Ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure,\" said Dr. Michelle Griffin, a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in Seifalian's lab.\n\n\"At the moment, children who need new ears have to go through a really invasive procedure involving taking cartilage from their ribs,\" Griffin said. She added they plan to eventually create an entirely synthetic face but must first prove their polymer scaffolds won't accidentally burst out of the skin.\n\n\"Scientists have to get things like noses and ears right before we can move onto something like a kidney, lungs or a liver, which is much more complicated,\" said Eileen Gentleman, a stem cell expert at King's College London, who is not involved in Seifalian's research. \"What (Seifalian) has created is the correct structure and the fact that it's good enough for his patients to have a functional (windpipe), tear duct, etc., is pretty amazing,\" she said.\n\nSome scientists predicted certain lab-made organs will soon cease to be experimental.\n\n\"I'm convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon,\" said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor of transplantation biology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. She has transferred lab-made blood vessels into a handful of patients and plans to offer them more widely by 2016, pending regulatory approval.\n\nSeifalian hopes lab-made organs will one day be available for a few hundred dollars.\n\n\"If people are not that fussy, we could manufacture different sizes of noses so the surgeon could choose a size and tailor it for patients before implanting it,\" he said. \"People think your nose is very individual and personal but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day.\"'"

            "text": "\tIf Chester Nez dared to use his Navajo language in school, punishment was swift and literally distasteful. He had to scrub his tongue with a toothbrush and wash out his mouth with bitter soap.\n\nSo he was intrigued when recruiters from the U.S. Marines showed up in 1942 seeking young men like him who knew both English and Navajo.\n\nThat day, four months after Japanese bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, Nez helped form an elite, top-secret group that became known as the Navajo code talkers. Using the Navajo language, they developed an unbreakable military communications code, then risked their lives on battlefields across the Pacific to send and decipher messages critical to America and its allies in World War II.\n\nHe didn't have to volunteer; barred from voting, [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American) were barely considered citizens. But Nez's heritage spoke louder than decades of rejection. \"I reminded myself that my Navajo people had always been warriors, protectors,\" he wrote years later. \"In that there was honor. I would concentrate on being a warrior, on protecting my homeland.\"\n\nNez, the last of the original 29 code talkers, died Wednesday in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was 93 and had kidney failure, said Judith Avila, who helped Nez write his 2011 memoir, \"Code Talker.\"\n\nIn 2001 he received the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress' highest civilian honor, from President George W. Bush.\n\nOne of five children, Nez was born Jan. 23, 1921, in Two Wells, New Mexico. His mother died when he was about 3. When he was about 9, his struggling father packed him off to government boarding schools to learn English and other skills that might help him succeed among whites.\n\nThe Marines showed up at his high school in Tuba City, Arizona, in the spring of 1942. The recruiters did not say why they needed Navajos, but the promise of adventure appealed to a teenager whose future otherwise seemed to offer little more than growing corn and beans or tending sheep.\n\n\"The Navajo feeling is to go to the top of the hill and see what's on the other side,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2001.\n\nHe left immediately for basic training at Camp Pendleton. After boot camp, he and the other 28 Navajos chosen for the project were sent to Camp Elliott in San Diego. It was there that they learned the daunting nature of their assignment.\n\nThe Japanese had already broken every code used by the Allies, so when Philip Johnston, a World War I veteran who had grown up on a Navajo reservation, proposed using the Navajo language as the basis for a new code, the top brass thought it was worth a try.\n\nIn many respects, Navajo was perfect for the task: It had no written form, used complicated syntax and had unusual tonal features that added another layer of difficulty.\n\nFor 13 weeks Nez and his fellow recruits were confined to a room at the base where they were instructed to come up with words to represent the letters A to Z as well as a code for military terms. At first \"everybody thought we'd never make it,\" Nez recalled. \"It seemed impossible because even among ourselves, we didn't agree on all the right Navajo words.\"\n\nBut the code finally emerged.\n\n\"Wol-la-chee,\" the Navajo word for \"ant,\" represented A, \"na-hash-chid,\" the word for \"badger,\" was B, \"moasi,\" the word for \"cat,\" was C, and so on. For key military words, they relied on easy-to-remember images. So \"a-ye-shi,\" the word for \"eggs,\" for example, meant \"bombs.\" \"Ni-ma-si,\" or \"potatoes,\" signified \"grenades.\"\n\nOnce they agreed on the code, they began to practice it, demonstrating speed and accuracy. Messages that had taken 30 minutes to code and decrypt using other systems were translated and deciphered in 20 seconds by the Navajo code talkers.\n\nThe first message Nez transmitted was at Guadalcanal in November 1942: \"Enemy machine gun next on your right. Destroy.\" The Allied forces blasted the target.\n\nAfter Guadalcanal, Nez never stopped moving, encrypting, relaying and deciphering messages about enemy positions, Allied strategy, casualties and supplies - at the Battle of Bougainville in New Guinea in November 1943, Guam in July 1944 and Peleliu and Angaur in September 1944. The code talkers were so vital to the war effort that they were not permitted leaves.\n\n\"We were almost always needed to transmit information, to ask for supplies and ammunition and to communicate strategies,\" Nez wrote in his memoir. \"And after each transmission, to avoid Japanese fire, we had to move.\"\n\nUltimately 400 Navajos served as code talkers. They were crucial to the campaign on Iwo Jima, conveying and decoding 800 messages without error in the first 48 hours of the operation. \"Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima,\" according to a memo by Maj. Howard Conner, a 5th Marine Division signal officer.\n\nNez avoided serious injury but was once threatened at gunpoint - by a fellow GI who thought he was a Japanese soldier.\n\nHe remained in the Marines through the Korean War. But civilian life proved difficult at times. The code talkers were forbidden to talk about their activities for more than two decades, until their mission was declassified in 1968. Nez avoided veterans parades and had nightmares about Japanese soldiers and the carnage he witnessed.\n\nFor many of his fellow code talkers, the secrecy order made it hard to get a job; they couldn't tell employers what they had done during the war.\n\n\"Chester was one of the lucky ones,\" Avila said in an interview Wednesday. \"He got an interview at the VA hospital in Albuquerque and was hired to be a maintenance guy. He was a painter. Sometimes he painted lovely things,\" including murals depicting Navajo culture. He retired in 1974.\n\nHe is survived by sons Michael and Tyah, nine grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.\n\n\"I worried every day that I might make an error that cost American lives,\" Nez told CNN a few years ago. \"But our code was the only code in modern warfare that was never broken. The Japanese tried, but they couldn't decipher it. Not even another Navajo could decipher it if he wasn't a code talker.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - There's only one thing that comes between the grade school kids hopping off the afternoon bus near Eve Pulver-Johnson's Aurora, Ill., house and their after-school snacks - the Little Free Library on her family's front lawn.\n\nThe children like to take an extra minute near the stop to peek inside the free-standing blue and white box full of books, some of them grabbing a book to go. Who knows? Maybe somebody put one of Mo Willems' popular children's stories in there.\n\n\"The kids are excited about it,\" said Pulver-Johnson, who believes her Little Free Library along Sumac Drive is the first in Aurora. \"It's really fun to see them digging through and looking for something particular to their interest.\"\n\nLittle Free Libraries are handcrafted structures full of books for children and adults, a free-books movement that has spread not only around Illinois but onto lawns around the world. They are designed and decorated to the owner's - or steward's - taste, and stand on lawns, in parks and gardens, even in coffee shops where passers-by of all ages can \"take a book, leave a book.\" Generally they hold 20 to 100 books.\n\nLittle Free Libraries originated in Wisconsin in 2009, and in four years have become as much about building a sense of community as they are about encouraging people to read, said co-founder Rick Brooks, of Madison. Brooks and co-founder Todd Bol, of Hudson, Wis., expect to have at least 15,000 Little Free Libraries in 55 countries by year's end.\n\n\"Interest in them doesn't seem to be abating,\" Brooks said. \"It's always amazing.\"\n\nAccording to the Little Free Library website, littlefreelibrary.org, there are about 60 stands registered in Illinois, with eight in Chicago and about 25 in the suburbs.\n\nOwners are encouraged to register their libraries online to help book lovers find them, but Pulver-Johnson, who recently hosted a little neighborhood grand opening for hers, hasn't registered it yet. Brooks guesses many are not registered and also admits that the nonprofit's small staff is behind on getting some libraries added to its database.\n\nThe \"libraries\" themselves might appear to passers-by as large dollhouses or birdhouses.\n\n\"Some are stunningly beautiful,\" Brooks said. \"Others are clever, funny or so skillfully painted that they are like sculptures more than just boxes of books.\"\n\nIdeally, the books are enclosed to stay protected from the elements. Weatherproofing advice is offered on the website.\n\nJust because you take a book doesn't mean you have to leave one, Brooks said. Most people do so in order to maintain a variety of books in the library and keep the circulation of the books flowing.\n\nPulver-Johnson's little two-story library - with books for adults on the top shelf and children's books below - was a homemade birthday present from her dad, Tom Pulver, who built one for his lawn in Glen Ellyn, Ill., more than a year ago. Eve's mother, Karen Pulver, a librarian in Wood Dale, Ill, said that although the Glen Ellyn public library is less than a half mile from their home, she has foot traffic to their free library every day.\n\n\"I have talked to a number of parents who say that's often their destination on their walk, to bring a book or take a book,\" Karen Pulver said. \"It's handy. It's a good incentive to read.\"\n\nMartha Martinez enjoys visiting the library at the neighboring Johnson house in Aurora with her 8-year-old daughter, Barbara, an avid reader who was on the lookout for \"The Cat Who ...\" mystery books.\n\n\"This is a very beautiful idea and it's very nice of them to offer it for the neighborhood,\" Martha Martinez said. \"The kids are always excited to see what's in there, but it's actually nice for all of us.\"\n\nFrom Mary Anne Mohanraj's window in Oak Park, Ill., she frequently sees several adults stop at her painted blue-and-purple Little Free Library, most of them on their way to the CTA's Green Line.\n\nA writer and English professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, she remembers that the public library was her haven as a child.\n\n\"I wanted to be a librarian when I was a kid ... well, until a librarian told me that librarians don't get to read all the time,\" she said. \"Luckily, English professors have to read.\"\n\nSo many people check the box on her lawn that the books change almost every day, she said, and although she has small children, she targets adult readers.\n\n\"We get a good mix of books,\" she said. \"Popular fiction tends to go the fastest.\"\n\nLaura Lynn Hsieh lives within walking distance of Mohanraj's home and has used her Little Free Library. But she currently is reading a book she got at a Little Free Library in Andover, Mass., where she and her son visited her parents.\n\nWhen they went back to the site to return a book her son had chosen and read, \"I was surprised that most of the books had completely turned over in less than a week,\" she said.\n\n\"I love the idea that people are sharing books in residential or pedestrian public spaces,\" Hsieh said. \"(There are) no expectations or presumptions about what people think is worth reading or sharing, or how long it might take one person or another to read a book.\"\n\nMohanraj, who tends a flower garden around her library, enjoys neighborly chats with people who stop. Those types of encounters are one of the appealing features of Little Free Libraries, Brooks said.\n\n\"It's about relationships as much as it is about the books and the box,\" said Brooks, a retired outreach program manager for the University of Wisconsin. \"That sense of community that happens trumps all of our goals.\n\n\"It's a great tool for promoting literacy, reading and public libraries, but we have a yearning for a good feeling about neighbors and living in a society where we are not alone.\"\n\nLittle Free Libraries began when Bol, a social [entrepreneur](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) and retired teacher, built the first: a miniature schoolhouse that was a memorial tribute to his mother, who was a teacher. Now Madison and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area are the nonprofit's hot spots, each boasting about 1,000 Little Free Libraries.\n\nThe idea has spread nationwide. El Paso, Texas, has more than 60. Bicycle tours in Seattle take people from library to library.\n\n\"Italy has a lot,\" said Brooks, based on online registration. \"Ghana has 70, and they are building them now in the Ukraine.\"\n\nAt the Starbucks at 1245 W. Fullerton Ave. in Chicago, the little library in the foyer is so popular that sometimes it has more books than can fit on the shelves, and sometimes it gets used textbooks from local students, a Starbucks representative said.\n\nSu Erickson, president of the Illinois Library Association, said the libraries are \"a wonderful way to give back and share thoughts and ideas that others may not normally be exposed to.\"\n\n\"It's a unique way to get people out and about reading and interacting about what they've read,\" Erickson said.\n\nSuch little libraries can also aid areas not served by a public library, said Erickson, the branch library coordinator at the DuPage campus of Robert Morris University in Aurora. Brooks said he and Bol are currently focusing on those small towns without a public library.'"

            "text": "\tUgh, middle school.\n\nThere's awkwardness, cliques and bullying. The challenges of preadolescence. Low-self esteem, or maybe too much self-esteem.\n\nIt can all collide in the cafeteria and leave some kids feeling invisible if they don't fit in at any one particular table.\n\nWhat difference could it make if students themselves tried to encourage a change in the lunchroom?\n\nThat's the idea behind a national campaign called \"No One Eats Alone Day,\" a student-led program that takes aim at social isolation among middle schoolers.\n\nSchools are picking up on the idea. More than 300,000 students across the country signed up to participate. Participation grew from 35 schools in 2014 to more than 700 this year.\n\nThe program was created by Beyond Differences, a national nonprofit group whose mission is to change the culture in middle schools to be more inclusive.\n\nWith social isolation and bullying now considered a chronic problem in schools, this program seeks to reverse these trends by asking students to engage in simple and fun ways to include others during lunchtime - making sure no one eats alone, said Laura Talmus, the founder of Beyond Differences.\n\nMiddle school was a rough couple of years for Talmus' daughter, Lili Smith. Lili was born with a cranial facial syndrome.\n\n\"She would call me almost daily, 'Mom, I have nobody to eat with, and the girls don't want me to sit with them,'\" Talmus said, who said her daughter would finish her lunch and call her from the restroom crying. \"Lili was never teased or bullied, but was almost suffering as much because she felt invisible.\"\n\nLili died at the age of 15 from medical complications of her syndrome. Afterward, a group of teens from the community banded together to bring change to their local schools.\n\nIt's not an easy task.\n\nAt Rogers Middle School in Affton, Missouri, resistance to No One Eats Alone Day began after students learned of it through the morning announcements. The student organizers heard that a lot of students were worried that they wouldn't get to sit next to their friends.\n\nOn Friday, the student members of the school's Mistreatment Leadership Team placed ice-breakers and conversation starters on the round tables in their cafeteria. Questions like, \"Who is your favorite celeb?\" and \"Who is your role model?\"\n\nThe students waited nervously with pieces of paper to hand out to classmates, color-coded to randomly assign them to tables.\n\nWhen the lunch bell rang, there was audible disappointment among those who were separated. Others ran and hugged their friends when they realized they would be at the same table.\n\nSome tried to make the best of what they said was an uncomfortable situation.\n\n\"I would much rather sit alone than with people I don't know, to be honest,\" said Cori Caby, a seventh-grader who was at a table with some students she usually sits with and some she doesn't.\n\nSome switched cards before others noticed so they could sit with their friends.\n\nThen there was the distraction of cellphones, an easy way to get out of talking to people you don't know.\n\nNo one was saying the kids were going to become best friends after just one lunch.\n\nIt was more about being aware of other people's feelings, and encouraging students to reach out and start a conversation with someone they normally don't talk to, said Reece Black, an eighth-grader and one of the organizers. Reece called out at least one table of kids sitting with their usual group.\n\nBut he saw successes, too.\n\nSixth-graders Jenna Walden and Avarry Wilkerson ended up at a table by themselves, and they noticed that Alexander Scherer, a new student at school, was alone. They moved over to sit with him. As he ate his chicken patty sandwich and french fries, he and the girls talked about Six Flags.\n\n\"By the way, I'm Avarry,\" she said, just as lunch was wrapping up.\n\nReece and the other student leaders say they saw other examples of kids reaching out.\n\n\"So that was pretty cool,\" Reece said.'"

            "text": "\tORLANDO, Fla. - Christin Rivas, 14, was fascinated by the small, round toy magnets that you can sculpt into shapes and use to perform magic tricks.\n\nPut a pen on a desk, hold a magnet underneath and watch the pen move across the desktop.\n\nWhile playing with a couple of these rare-earth magnets at her Satellite Beach, Fla., middle school last week, Christin needed both hands to grab something, so she decided to hold the mini-magnets in her mouth. Someone made her laugh, and ... gulp. She swallowed the magnets.\n\nFive days later, Christin was at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Fla., having the magnets surgically removed from her intestines, along with a small section of her colon and her appendix.\n\nLabels warning that magnets are harmful if swallowed have not stopped an increasing number of kids from putting them in their mouths or noses and then getting them stuck in their bodies, where they can cause serious harm.\n\nThe groups that get into the most trouble are children age 5 and younger, and tweens and teens, who use the magnets to mimic tongue, lip, cheek or nose piercings.\n\n\"Kids swallow a lot of objects,\" said Dr. Tejas Mehta, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Arnold Palmer who treated Rivas, \"but from a GI perspective, magnets cause more damage than anything else.\"\n\nThat risks soars when more than one magnet goes down.\n\nMagnets will work so hard to find each other that their force can cause intestines to twist and become blocked. The pull can also cause erosion, then ulceration, and eventually the intestine can perforate, causing infection, Mehta said.\n\nFour out of five kids who swallow multiple magnets will need an invasive procedure, such as an endoscopy or surgery, said Mehta, who has heard of kids swallowing magnets and needing massive bowel resections.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 magnet-related emergency-room visits among Americans younger than 21 increased fivefold, according to a recent study published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.\n\nDuring that 10-year period, 22,500 magnet injuries were reported. Usually the kids swallowed the magnets, but about one-fourth put the magnets up their nose, said Julie Brown, an emergency-room doctor at the University of Washington, in Seattle, and lead author of the study. The magnets break loose and go in, not out.\n\nBased on data Brown has seen since then, the problem shows no sign of slowing.\n\n\"There is something very tempting about them,\" Brown said. \"When playing with this fidgety toy, you want to put it in your mouth. You want to try to separate the magnets with your teeth.\"\n\nTo toddlers, they look just like the silver-ball candies you put on cupcakes, she said.\n\nBuckyballs, a set of 216 magnets that consumers can manipulate into sculptures and chain jewelry, is one culprit. Last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission asked retailers and makers of Buckyballs and Zen Magnets, a similar toy, to stop selling them.\n\nBut you can still find them online, said Brown, who has researched the issue and claims more than 3 million sets of the magnet sets have been sold. At 216 magnets per set, that's 600 million in circulation.\n\nOther magnet-containing products are equally worrisome, she said, citing metallic bulletin boards that have little magnet pins, refrigerator magnets that look like candies or coffee beans (begging to be tasted) and fishing games that involve a magnet on a rod.\n\nMany emergency-room physicians don't know how serious the problem can be. When Barbara Rivas took her daughter to the emergency room at Wuesthoff Medical Center, the doctor ordered an X-ray, then sent Christin and her mother home and said the magnets would pass.\n\nThat advice didn't set well with Rivas, who did some online research.\n\n\"That's when I hit the panic button,\" she said.\n\nAfter going to another ER, she was referred to Arnold Palmer, where doctors admitted Christin and tracked her magnets' path by X-ray.\n\nNormally, food or foreign objects take six to eight hours to go from entry to exit, Mehta said. When the magnets Christin swallowed stalled at the neck of the large colon for 24 hours, doctors decided to operate.\n\nAnyone who has surgery on the small bowel runs a 10 percent chance of developing a bowel obstruction later in life, Brown said.\n\n\"Don't even think about touching them or buying them,\" Christin said. \"I messed up my intestines. I worry about that down the road.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Robert McDaniel was puzzled when the Chicago police commander dropped by his West Side home unannounced last month. The visit was cordial, but Barbara West's message was clear: Don't commit any more crimes or face the consequences.\n\nRevealing that she had a folder on him back on her office desk, West told the 22-year-old that she knew his best friend had been slain last year in their crime-plagued Austin community. She cautioned that he could meet the same fate if he didn't change his ways. McDaniel, who has multiple arrests on suspicion of minor offenses but only one misdemeanor conviction, learned to his surprise that he had made the so-called \"heat list\" with more than 400 others across the city who have been deemed by the department to be most prone to violence - either as a perpetrator or victim.\n\n\"I haven't done nothing that the next kid growing up hadn't done. Smoke weed. Shoot dice. Like seriously?\" an incredulous McDaniel said while recalling the recent visit from police brass with a Chicago Tribune reporter.\n\nWith the help of mathematical analysis, Chicago police hope to home in on people it believes are most at risk of shooting someone or being shot themselves. The strategy calls for warning those on the heat list individually that further criminal activity, even for the most petty offenses, will result in the full force of the law being brought down on them. At the same time, police extend them an olive branch of sorts, an offer of help obtaining a job or of social services.\n\nAt least one criminologist said the department will have to take a long-term approach if it hopes to be successful with people who could be so deeply embedded in gang or criminal life that the threat of death or jail might not deter them.\n\nThe effort, funded by a federal grant from the National Institute of Justice, is formally known as Two Degrees of Association - an acknowledgment of the importance of the interconnections among those involved in crime.\n\nThe department's efforts have been influenced by the work of Andrew Papachristos, an associate professor of sociology at Yale University whose research in the Lawndale and Garfield Park communities on the West Side found a homicide rate there more than three times worse than the Chicago average. The homicide victims in those areas, he learned, often shared similar backgrounds: lengthy arrest records, victims themselves of past shootings and arrests with others who also had been shot.\n\n\"If you hang around people who are getting shot, even if you're not actively doing anything, then you become exposed,\" Papachristos said in a telephone interview. \"... It's just like sharing needles. It puts you at risk because of the behaviors of your friends and your associates.\"\n\nPolice officials said they came up with a heat list of 420 names through a computer analysis, weighting numerous risk factors to come up with a ranking of people who in the worst cases were more than 500 times more likely than average to be involved in violence. Among the factors are the extent of a person's rap sheet, his or her parole or warrant status, any weapons or drug arrests, his or her acquaintances and their arrest histories - and whether any of those associates have been shot in the past.\n\n\"What we're trying to figure out now is how does that data inform what happens in the future,\" said Debra Kirby, chief of the department's bureau of organizational development, which compiled the data for the list. \"What happened yesterday may not be what happens tomorrow.\"\n\nMcDaniel, for instance, likely made the list in spite of his limited criminal background - misdemeanor arrests on suspicion of gambling, drug possession and domestic battery - because a childhood friend with whom he had once been arrested on a marijuana charge was fatally shot last year in Austin.\n\nInterviewed at his Austin home, McDaniel said he was offended at being singled out by West, commander of the Austin police district. All the attention made him nervous because his neighbors noticed, leading them, he feared, to wonder if he was a police snitch. Two officers waited outside on the porch while the commander and a criminal justice expert spoke to McDaniel in his home.\n\n\"Like I said, I have no (criminal) background, so what would even give you probable cause to watch me?\" said McDaniel, a high school dropout. \"And if you're watching me, then you can obviously see I'm not doing anything.\"\n\nA 17-year-old girl was shocked to learn she was among a handful of women on the list. Since police have contacted people only in Austin so far, the girl, who lives in the South Chicago neighborhood, hasn't been officially informed by police that she made the heat list.\n\nThe Dunbar Vocational Career Academy senior said she was arrested only once as a juvenile for mob action in the River North neighborhood.\n\n\"I'm not the bad guy,\" said the girl, who plans to attend college. \"There's people out here doing stuff every day. And that (arrest) was years ago. I haven't been locked up ever since.\" But the list proved prophetic in the case of Jacobi Herring, who was fatally shot this month as he walked home in his South Chicago neighborhood. The 21-year-old had just left a late-night party a few blocks from his home when he was gunned down at East 79th Street and South Yates Boulevard, an area known to residents as \"Terror Town\" because of its incessant gun violence and gang activity.\n\nHis uncle, Koland Herring, was not surprised to learn that his nephew was on the heat list, saying he succumbed to peer pressure in the neighborhood.\n\n\"He's not a hard-core gangbanger. He was never a shooter, burglarizing or stealing cars, anything like that,\" Herring, 49, said outside his nephew's home as friends and relatives stopped by to pay their respects to the South Shore High School graduate. \"Some of the people that he knew did. They're hard-core. And in order to get around and to be accepted out here ... you have to be around them.\"\n\nCook County court records show Herring was arrested only a handful of times, mostly on suspicion of trespassing and gang loitering. However, four others who were once arrested with Herring also made the list. In addition, another man who was once arrested with Herring was shot and killed in March in broad daylight. And Herring himself was shot in 2008 at 79th Street and Essex Avenue.\n\nHerring's father, Floyd Redmond, recalled that the two had planned to attend the Bud Billiken Parade on the Saturday that Herring was killed.\n\n\"We talked about him getting shot all the time,\" said Redmond, 41. \"I used to see my son hanging out, and I used to ride down on him. ... I feared for my son being out on these streets because I know what these streets are all about, man.\"\n\nTo kick off the pilot program last month in her district, West knocked on the doors of about two dozen people on the heat list in Austin over about a two-week period.\n\nChristopher Mallette of the City University of New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who accompanied West door to door, said not all of the people were home, so they spoke to relatives and left letters warning those on the heat list of the consequences of continued criminal behavior.\n\nAfter West talked about their criminal records and the dangerous crowd they hang around, Mallette offered them a chance to obtain job training, substance abuse counseling, better housing options or an array of other social services.\n\nSome were more receptive than others.\n\n\"Some of them ... acknowledged, 'You know what? He's a bad seed.' We had two or three people say, 'Thank you for doing this,' \" said Mallette, who wore a bulletproof vest his first night out with West. \"It's not a threat. We're giving you information. Not just the law enforcement information ... information that there's no excuses for anyone to be out there shooting and killing.\"\n\nBut Arthur Lurigio, a psychology and criminal justice professor at Loyola University Chicago, said the message could be a hard sell, particularly the warnings of a police crackdown if necessary.\n\n\"Young men entrenched in a criminal lifestyle are fatalistic and are generally undeterred by the prospect of future punishments,\" he said.\n\nA Tribune reporter who later went to some of the Austin addresses on the heat list found out that a number of the people didn't live at those locations or were locked up. For instance, Daniel Hill, 21, is serving a four-year prison term for selling heroin. His mother, Bridget Hutcherson, said she never got a visit from West, but she wasn't surprised to hear that her son had made the list. She said he is autistic and started getting into trouble in his early teens.\n\n\"If you're selling drugs or you get convicted of selling drugs, it more likely is associated with a violent crime,\" Hutcherson, 40, said from her front porch.\n\nNext door lives Yvonne Carroll, who identified herself as legal guardian to Terry McCoy, 20, who also made the list.\n\nCarroll wasn't surprised to hear McCoy was singled out because he's in the Cook County Jail awaiting trial related to a 2011 armed robbery. But she questioned the value of the list and wondered if police were merely profiling her son.\n\n\"They stereotype a lot of the blacks anyway,\" said Carroll, who is African-American. \"The black community is not the only community that has violence. They have it in other neighborhoods, but ... they don't stereotype it like that like they do in the black community.\"\n\nBut police officials defended the list, noting that the names aren't chosen randomly. As for McDaniel, in spite of his misgivings over being named to the list, he's considering taking Mallette up on his offer of social services, especially because he has a 2-year-old daughter and another child on the way.\n\nBut he insisted he doesn't belong on the department's radar.\n\n\"As far as them trying to make me a product of their work,\" he said, \"I don't too much appreciate that.\"'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - Want a side salad with that Big Mac?\n\nMcDonald's says it will start giving customers the choice of a salad, fruit or vegetable as a substitute for french fries in its value meals.\n\nMcDonald's Corp. will roll out the change early next year in the U.S., where people will be able to pick a salad instead of fries at no extra cost. McDonald's says it already lets customers make such swaps in some countries, such as France.\n\nBut now it says it now work to make the options available in 20 of its biggest markets around the world, which represent 85 percent of sales. McDonald's, which has more than 34,000 locations around the world, said the change will be in place in 30 to 50 percent of the areas within the next three years and 100 percent the regions by 2020.\n\nThe world's biggest hamburger chain made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York City, where CEO Don Thompson made an appearance on stage with former President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn an interview before the announcement, Thompson said McDonald's is looking at developing other healthy sides that will appeal to customers. He noted that the company could also take the fruits and vegetables it offers in other parts of the world, such as cups of corn and kiwi on a stick, and make them more widely available.\n\n\"What is it that customers will choose, and what will they eat?\" Thompson said. \"What we don't want to do is just put something on the menu and say, hey, we did it. We really want consumption.\"\n\nMcDonald's also announced that it would use its packaging to make healthier options more appealing to kids. For example, a side of carrots might come in a more colorfully designed bag. Parents will still be able to order soda with Happy Meals, but McDonald's says it will only promote milk, juice and water on menu boards and in advertising. All advertising to kids will include a \"fun nutrition or children's well-being\" message, the company said.\n\nMargo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the health advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said taking soda off the menu as an option for Happy Meals was a big step that other fast-food chains should follow. But she said the push to include positive nutrition messages in ads to kids could serve to give McDonald's a \"health halo\" that it doesn't necessarily deserve.\n\n\"The changes McDonald's are making make the food somewhat healthier. But I don't think a hamburger, some apples and fries is something I'd call healthy,\" she said.\n\nThe announcement comes as McDonald's faces criticism from health advocates who say it promotes bad eating habits. After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald's is also struggling to shake its fast-food image and keep up with shifting tastes. Late last year, the company reported its first monthly sales decline in nearly a decade and sales performance around the world has been choppy ever since.\n\nTo better reflect the way people are eating, McDonald's recently started giving customers the choice to substitute egg whites in all its breakfast sandwiches. It also rolled out chicken wraps, which are partly intended to go after people who want foods they feel are fresher or healthier. Earlier in the week, rival Burger King rolled out lower-calorie french fries, reflecting the growing demand for better-for-you options.\n\nMcDonald's marketing to children is also an ongoing issue. A recent study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, for example, found that the chain's ads targeting children often emphasize toy giveaways and movie tie-ins, rather than food. And at its latest annual shareholders meeting, a 9-year-old girl made headlines after she stood to ask Thompson to stop \"tricking\" kids into eating the company's food.\n\nThe girl was with her mother, who was affiliated with Corporate Accountability, which has pressured McDonald's to changes its marketing practices to kids.\n\nThe criticism is clearly a sensitive topic for Thompson, who noted that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation was among the first organizations that approached the company to use its \"marketing might\" to help kids. The group, which is working with McDonald's on its new health goals, was founded by the Clinton Global Initiative and the American Heart Association.\n\n\"Others have said, 'McDonald's, don't advertise to kids,'\" Thompson said. \"We've always felt like, wow, if we had the impact that you think we have, why don't we leverage it to do something great for kids?\"\n\nHowell Wechsler, CEO of Alliance for a Healthier Generation, said the commitments made by McDonald's were worked out over the course of more than a year. He said the final agreement could help change the way people eat over time, given McDonald's enormous reach.'"

            "title": "Babies at suburban Chicago day care center diagnosed with measles",
            "text": "\tFive children at a KinderCare Learning Center in suburban Chicago have been diagnosed with measles, Illinois and Cook County health officials announced Thursday.\n\nPublic health officials are investigating the cluster of measles cases at the center in northwest suburban Palatine, Illinois, according to a statement. Two of the cases have been confirmed with laboratory testing while the other three diagnoses are pending test results, according to a joint statement from health officials.\n\nAll five children are under the age of 1.\n\nThe announcement comes about a week after Cook County officials announced the state's first confirmed case this year of the respiratory disease, traced to a suburban Cook County resident who officials would only identify as being older than 18. At the time, officials listed three locations where others might have been exposed to the patient in mid January - including two in Palatine.\n\nCook County officials say it's not clear if the adult's diagnosis is linked to the children at the day care or to the outbreak associated with Disneyland, which has grown to more than 100 cases, many of them in California.\n\nStudents and staff at the Palatine facility have been notified, and anyone who hasn't been vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been instructed to remain at home.\n\nAnyone at the facility who did not have an updated vaccination record is \"excluded from the center\" until Feb. 24, said Colleen Moran, spokeswoman for KinderCare, which runs 1,500 learning centers in the U.S. that offer care and schooling for infants through 12-year-olds.\n\nMoran said the center was following the guidance of the Cook County Public Health Department by keeping unvaccinated children and staff away from the center until that date, calling it \"a precaution.\"\n\n\"We just want everyone to recover quickly and to stay safe,\" Moran said.\n\nCook County officials say any resident who is unvaccinated and experiences measles symptoms of a high fever and rash should call their local health department and their doctor.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis and death. It's transmitted by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing and can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Infected people are contagious from four days before their rash starts through four days afterward, according to state and county health officials.\n\nChildren as young as those who were diagnosed with measles from the child care center are not recommended for the vaccine. That's because \"their immune response doesn't last,\" Ingalls Memorial Hospital Dr. Wendell Wheeler said. \"It's a temporary response, which is why we wait until 12 months.\"\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend that children get their first dose of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine at 12 to 15 months old and a second shot at 4 to 6 years old, before starting kindergarten.\n\nDespite a national MMR vaccination coverage level of 92 percent, one child in 12 in the United States is not receiving the first dose of MMR vaccine on time, underscoring considerable measles susceptibility across the country, according to the CDC.\n\nUnvaccinated children are among the most vulnerable to measles, which is among the most contagious of all diseases, Wheeler said.\n\n\"The very young have small airways,\" Wheeler said. \"The disease has thick mucus and the two don't go together. They are not moving air well and they get into trouble,\" he said, adding that pneumonia is often a complication.\n\nIf your child has only the first dose of the measles vaccine, he or she may not be fully protected. About 5 to 10 percent do not develop an adequate immune response after one dose, which is why a second dose is necessary, said Dr. Tina Tan, an infectious disease specialist at Lurie Children's Hospital.\n\n\"If given at the appropriate interval and age, after two doses of measles vaccine a person is considered protected for life,\" she said.\n\nThose who are too young to get vaccinated are protected by the majority who are inoculated, called herd immunity.\n\nHowever, when the vaccination rate drops below 95 percent, a community loses its herd immunity to highly contagious diseases such as measles, Tan explained.\n\n\"(Herd immunity) matters because the virus has no place to go,\" Wheeler said. \"If it hits person 1 and they're immune and person 2 and they're immune ... But if it hits person 1 who is not immune, well, it can increase exponentially.\"\n\nThe vaccine is required for Illinois students. Statewide, the percentage of school children who have complied with measles vaccination rules has remained about 98 percent over the past decade, according to the Illinois State Board of Education, which collects data from public and nonpublic schools. But that includes both those who got the vaccine and those who officially opted out of vaccinations for religious or medical reasons, according to the agency.\n\nHeather Robinson took her 15-month-old for the MMR shot last month. The child broke out into a rash that covered every inch of her body - \"it was even in her ears,\" said her mother. \"I was totally freaking out. I thought it was measles.\"\n\nIt turned out to be a reaction to the shot. Still, the Homewood mother is glad she was proactive.\n\n\"I have friends who don't vaccinate ... they admit that they're depending on others to be responsible, which is kind of hypocritical.\"'"

            "text": "\tRAMALLAH, West Bank - When Sari Sakakini opened his ceramic-tiled Orjuwan deli in Ramallah's well-to-do Masyoun neighborhood, he hoped it would be the start of a global franchise of Palestinian food. A year later, that hope has dimmed.\n\nThe shop's bright wooden shelves hold only a sparse collection of homemade sauces, glossy olives and prepared soups. His kitchen staff, which also cooks for the attached restaurant of the same name, could not keep up the inventory.\n\n\"I want to put Palestinian food all over the world,\" said Sakakini. \"But over here, it's just putting food on the table.\"\n\nRamallah is the cultural and political hub of West Bank Palestinian life, and in recent years it has seen a blossoming of restaurants. But unlike top-tier eateries in Beirut or Amman, Jordan, Ramallah's culinary scene stews under a lid of a stagnating local economy, conservative tastes and onerous Israeli restrictions.\n\nIt's a frustration for Palestinian food professionals, whose distress is heightened by living alongside an Israeli culinary boom.\n\nSkilled staff members are sparse in a land with few culinary schools. Sakakini's head chef is a full-time schoolteacher from the West Bank city of Hebron. There are no full-time Palestinian food critics or gastronomy magazines to spur innovation. Peter Nasir, who had hoped his Azure restaurant would become a culinary destination, recently lamented that chicken chow mein was about all the adventure his clientele would tolerate.\n\nAnd for all the eateries, profits are filo dough-thin, reflecting double taxation on imported ingredients and a tiny stock of customers shared among dozens of restaurants.\n\n\"Palestine is literally a forgotten corner,\" Sakakini said. \"Jordan is ... at least five or 10 years ahead of us. Lebanon is also at least 10 years ahead of us.\"\n\nThe scene is much different in Israel.\n\nFood lovers flock to Tel Aviv, named by Saveur magazine as an outstanding culinary destination in 2014. Israeli-born London chef Yotam Ottolenghi's cookbooks have each become global bestsellers, published in multiple languages. The Sabra brand of hummus, half owned by the Israeli Strauss Group, is the official dip of the National Football League.\n\nThe international acclaim is just the icing on the cake because Israelis eagerly devour their own food as well. The local edition of \"MasterChef,\" now in its fifth season, is among the highest-rated TV shows. Israelis also pioneered and exported a reality cooking TV format called \"Game of Chefs.\"\n\n\"It's very emotional for me,\" Sakakini said of the global infatuation with Israeli cuisine. \"It's the same kitchen.\"\n\nIsraeli cuisine fuses Palestinian flavors to Jewish kitchens from around the world. Palestinian cooks trace their roots to the Levant, be it Lebanese-Syrian recipes, Bedouin dishes or prized specialties of the Ottoman Empire. A glance at Palestinian cooks inside Israel reveals the cuisine's potential.\n\nCelebrity chef Nof Atamna-Ismaeel of the Arab Israeli town of Baka al Gharbiyeh recently conducted a cooking workshop at a culinary academy in Tel Aviv's tony renovated port. Atamna-Ismaeel, 34, is a doctorate-holding microbiologist who cooked at night until she won Israel's \"MasterChef\" in April 2014. The victory catapulted her to national fame; today she is a guest chef at renowned restaurants and a frequent contributor to national food magazines.\n\nFifteen Israelis eagerly watched her roll tamarind-flavored stuffed grape leaves and knead semolina dough for date cookies at the workshop. Atamna-Ismaeel abided by kosher cooking regulations, including the prohibition on non-Jews lighting the stove. She plans to open an Arab-Jewish cooking school in her hometown in northern Israel; it would be the only Israeli institution to offer culinary lessons in Arabic.\n\n\"'MasterChef' was the place that gave me a platform to continue,\" Atamna-Ismaeel said as she spread the yogurt cheese labaneh on a glass platter. \"It helped me decide. I always said, 'I know I cook well, but maybe not well enough.'\"\n\nWhat for Atamna-Ismaeel has been a meteoric rise to prominence is a distant dream for West Bank Palestinians.\n\nPeter Nasir, 34, studied computer science at Emory University in Atlanta and discovered his love of food while cooking for his roommates. They relished his okra stew and mensaf, a dish made with rice, meat and rehydrated salty dried yogurt.\n\nNasir returned to Ramallah, and after working for foreign aid organizations, in 2007 he converted his family's stone home and shaded courtyard into Azure. When he opened its doors, Nasir planned a short, curated menu highlighting local fare, fresh ingredients and subtle foreign twists. His enthusiasm was boundless; his customers' was not.\n\nTo stay in business, Nasir sliced down his ambitions and tripled his offerings. Today he serves Palestinian standards like hummus and grilled meats along with hamburgers, Mongolian-style steak and chicken cordon bleu, a cut of chicken breast pounded flat, wrapped around cheese and a slice of smoked turkey and fried. The dish is conventionally served with ham, but Nasir said he only cooks pork by special order to avoid offending Muslim clients.\n\n\"You have to target the masses,\" Nasir said. \"When people are strapped for cash, they want something guaranteed. They don't want to spend their money experimenting.\"\n\nNasir's quandary highlights the grinding realities of life in Ramallah. The average Israeli annual salary is 10 times the average Palestinian's of about $3,000. A quarter of Palestinian workers are employed by their government, and when the national budget runs low - as happened in February when Israel froze the transfer of taxes to Ramallah - business slows down.\n\nBeyond sheer economics, Nasir's customers are more risk averse because they travel far less than their Israeli counterparts. Most West Bank and Gazan Palestinians are prohibited from entering Israel or using the Tel Aviv airport. Travel abroad via Jordan is possible but a nuisance. Even driving between Bethlehem and Ramallah within the West Bank can take hours because of bypass roads that skirt Jerusalem.\n\nNasir, who holds a Jerusalem ID that permits him free travel in Israel, said his favorite restaurant is Tel Aviv's brasserie-inspired Montefiore Hotel restaurant.\n\n\"I'll spend the same amount of money (as I would in Ramallah) and enjoy eating from a chef in a proper place which is actually creative and doing different things, not the same typical food,\" Nasir said.\n\nOn his way back to Ramallah, Nasir buys Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise outside Tel Aviv to skirt the double taxation imposed by Israel and the Palestinian government on imported goods.\n\nDespite the limitations, Palestinian cooking is not without aspirations. \"The Gaza Kitchen\" cookbook, published in 2013, garnered international acclaim for its recipes of spicy seaside cuisine from the isolated enclave.\n\nEast Jerusalem chef Johnny Goric trained in the holy city's Notre Dame hospitality school, then studied at the French culinary bastions Institut Paul Bocuse and Lycee Francois Rabelais. Now Goric is finalizing the syllabus for a $500,000 culinary academy he plans to open in Ramallah in September that will train students in local cuisine and international techniques.\n\n\"I look at the Israeli chef in the eyes and we know we are on the same level,\" said Goric, who planned the menu for a private dinner served to visiting Pope Francis in 2014. He was also a judge during the short-lived Palestinian \"MasterChef.\"\n\nGoric won three gold medals at the 2010 Chef's World Cup in Luxembourg for his tapas, fish platters and terrines. Often, while his kitchen staff at the Legacy Hotel turns out a traditionalist menu of Palestinian and Italian stalwarts, Goric crafts beautifully plated entrees for competitions abroad.\n\nAt Orjuwan, co-owner Sakakini said Goric's school would be a lifeline. He said managing and training staff to use state-of-the-art equipment like a steam oven has been so all-consuming that when he started a food magazine called Ingredients in 2012, he folded it after three months for lack of time.\n\n\"Our cuisine is rich, but it has to be better presented and upgraded,\" Sakakini said. \"We're not missing anything.\"'"

            "text": "\tWATSONVILLE, Calif. - A lifetime of moving has taught Claudia Morales to start packing early, because like many 13-year-olds, her room \"is always a mess.\"\n\nThe hoodies go in her suitcase, but as usual, all her partially completed schoolwork ends up in the trash. Just a week later, Claudia has new notebooks, along with new textbooks, and three bulging suitcases to start unpacking 200 miles away.\n\nShe does this every year. Twice.\n\nThis December, thousands of migrant farmworker children are making their annual trek to new schools in California, but they do so also at other times throughout the country. During growing season, their parents rent low-cost housing in federally subsidized labor camps, but state rules mandate that families move at least 50 miles away when the camps close for the winter.\n\n\"We have a life we need to live,\" she said. \"I like both places, but when I grow up I expect to have good work and buy a house where we can stay permanently.\"\n\nClaudia gets straight A's at one school, somewhat lower grades at her other. But as years pass and coursework gets more complex, the odds rise against her. Eventually, about 90 percent of kids living in seasonal worker housing drop out of school, according to the San Jose-based nonprofit human rights organization Human Agenda.\n\nAt Aptos Junior High School, where Claudia started eighth grade this fall, migrant counselor Juan Alcantar said he has a handful of students who are flunking every class, biding their months before their move, sometimes as far away as Mexico.\n\n\"They see themselves as visitors on this campus,\" he said. \"They figure, 'I come from a labor camp next to a dump site. I don't belong, and I'm leaving soon.'\"\n\nA state lawmaker this year tried to change the 50-mile rule, but the bill died in committee.\n\nFor Claudia, the cycle continues. Her labor camp is less than an hour drive south of Silicon Valley, where in the past 50 years the region has transitioned from lush orchards and vegetable fields to a global technology hub.\n\n\"This is a largely invisible population, but we all should care a whole lot about this,\" said Stanford University Professor Amado Padilla, who studies immigration. \"Kids who don't finish school end up being a burden on society. On the flip side, kids who are well-educated end up being the caregivers both personally and economically of the older generation.\"\n\nCalifornia has 24 seasonal farmworker centers, 1,900 apartments all together, run by the state's Office of Migrant Housing. The program dates to the 1930s, when the federal government opened migrant labor camps for Dust Bowl refugees.\n\nThe idea behind the 50-mile rule was to provide seasonal housing for families who come to an area to work only during picking season.\n\nState officials say that despite a sharp drop-off in the past decade of migrating farmworker families, the seasonal housing should not be occupied year-round and hence unavailable for the next season's pickers and planters.\n\n\"We are not aware of members of families being in jams or having a problem with having to move away,\" said Guerdon Stuckey, an assistant deputy director at the state Department of Housing and Community Development. He said some families move from crop to crop and are not looking for permanent housing.\n\n\"We've met several of these farmworkers, and on the contrary, they're not only aware of the many affordable housing options, they enjoy this lifestyle,\" he said.\n\nClaudia's family lives in a complex of 50 flimsy - Styrofoam and plywood - prefabricated duplexes built in the late 1960s. Her bedroom window overlooks a small valley, a county jail and a dump. The rent of about $350 a month is still a lot for Claudia's dad Juan Morales, who made $9.50 an hour planting strawberry root stocks in November.\n\nMorales - in a large straw hat - joked with nearby planters, all bent at the waist, as loud music blared over the field. But he got serious when asked if Claudia, her brother Jose, 7, and sister Maria, 16, will ever join him. Legally they can start picking at 13.\n\n\"I want them to get a good education, I don't want them working here,\" he said.\n\n\"They take the pain for us,\" Claudia said of her parents' labors.\n\nClaudia started school each fall riding a school bus with other labor camp kids to Aptos Junior High, a buzzing school splashed with murals in a largely affluent community. After Thanksgiving, she moved to Palo Verde Union School in Tulare, a newer campus in a low-income community.\n\nIn the labor camp, Claudia knew just about everybody. \"I can walk around with my eyes closed.\" In Tulare, her family shares one room of a mobile home in a gang-ridden neighborhood. Claudia does not go out at night, but she likes it there. She has her own bed near the television where they watch her beloved telenovelas, Spanish language soap operas.\n\nClaudia started physics this fall in her science class. In September, they formed teams to build a roller coaster. She told her teacher she'd be gone before the due date and so she sat that one out, a lucky break, she said.\n\nIn Tulare, the science class was studying chemistry.\n\n\"Who remembers what a molecule is?\" asked teacher Kevin Meneses on her first day. \"If I have two or more of a different type of atom stuck together, what do I have?\"\n\nHands shot up. Students called out. Claudia was still.\n\n\"I just listen, I write it down, but I don't raise my hand because I have no idea what they're asking about,\" she said, shrugging. \"I just sit there.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - For people who don't live in the South Side neighborhood of Washington Park, there is hardly a reason to take the CTA's Green Line to the Garfield station.\n\nThough barely a mile from the stately University of Chicago campus, the desolate block of East Garfield Boulevard between Martin Luther King Drive and Prairie Avenue has little to offer, mostly one shuttered storefront after another and remnants of broken signage from businesses that once beckoned customers.\n\nBut it's possible that the landscape could change. Washington Park residents are pinning their hopes on President Barack Obama - that he will select the U. of C. to host his presidential library and that the university will build it on the swath of vacant, city-owned land adjacent to the \"L.\"\n\nWhile the site for the library will not be announced until early 2015, Chicago is considered by some observers to be the front-runner, partly because of the president and first lady Michelle Obama's strong personal and political ties to the city. Other bids are expected from Honolulu and New York.\n\nAcross Chicago, other neighborhoods also are wagering their dreams of a cultural and economic renaissance on the Obama library. At least five community groups, universities or developers from the Near West Side to the Far South Side are preparing bids for the library, hoping to become the beneficiary of the boon that is expected to follow.\n\n\"Placing the library in the middle of an urban community would bring opportunity, economic development and inspiration,\" said Carol Adams, executive director of the DuSable Museum of African American History in Washington Park. \"Kids could just be passing by and stop in. They wouldn't have to wait on school trips, with something as fantastic as a presidential library just down the street or around the corner from where they live.\"\n\nNone of the 13 presidential libraries and museums administered by the National Archives and Records Administration has been built in a low-income, inner-city neighborhood. So the challenge of using a presidential library as an economic engine to overhaul a neighborhood that suffers from long-term disinvestment is untested, according to library experts.\n\n\"When you look at a library, you have to look at the surrounding vicinity. It is unusual to try to rehabilitate part of an urban area by resurrecting a presidential library. There could be a risk of crime, poverty or reputation, and all of it has to be considered,\" said Curt Smith, a senior lecturer at the University of Rochester and author of the book \"Windows on the White House: The Story of Presidential Libraries.\"\n\n\"It's a noble thought to say, 'We're going to use the presidential library as a vehicle to rehabilitate an area.' But in doing that, you have to make sure you don't damage the library as a whole and end up not helping anyone,\" he said.\n\nIn Bronzeville, just south of McCormick Place, residents want the library built on the site of the former Michael Reese Hospital, a 48-acre property owned by the city. Chicago developer Dan McCaffery wants the library to anchor his $4 billion retail and residential development planned on the old U.S. Steel South Works site in southeast Chicago. The University of Illinois at Chicago is looking at six sites on the Near West Side to offer for the library. Chicago State University has identified two potential sites on its South Side campus, and a third site in the Pullman Historic District, which is being proposed as a national park.\n\nWith so many entities preparing to vie for the library, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has backed off his earlier goal of formulating a unified bid from Chicago. Instead, according to a City Hall source, the city is prepared to support any organization that makes a bid.\n\nThe University of Chicago has brought together a coalition of South Side residents, including Adams, to serve as advisers for its library proposal. In addition to Washington Park, there is land farther south in Woodlawn and South Shore as well as on the Near South Side near Roosevelt Road that could accommodate a library.\n\nUniversity officials have not indicated a preference for a specific site but have said that if they are awarded the project, they prefer to build it \"in the heart of the South Side,\" near their Hyde Park campus. The university will not choose a specific site but will leave that up to Obama and the first lady.\n\n\"Our view is that we very much want the Obama library on the mid-South Side. In any event, Hyde Park is landlocked, so it would have to be somewhere in the surrounding area,\" said Susan Sher, senior adviser to U. of C. President Robert Zimmer and coordinator of its library effort. \"We won't offer a site in our proposal. If we are more open to possibilities, it could increase our chances. It shows we're flexible.\"\n\nSher confirmed that the city-owned property in Washington Park is among several potential sites the university has looked at on the South Side. The university owns an adjacent lot that currently holds a gas station as well as a strip of mostly vacant 1920s-era storefronts on East Garfield. Last year the university opened the Arts Incubator - studio space for artists-in-residence - in one of the newly rehabbed storefronts.\n\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago also would like to extend the library's benefits beyond its campus to surrounding communities on the Near West Side. The six locations the university is looking at are either on campus or in residential areas north of Roosevelt Road between Halsted Street and Damen Avenue, officials said. All of the properties are owned by the university, and the list will be narrowed to two by June, they said.\n\n\"All of our campuses are in the neighborhoods, and we have the support of the surrounding communities,\" said Dick Simpson, a former Chicago alderman and political scientist at UIC who serves on the university's library proposal committee. \"This would be a major addition to the West Side of Chicago and offer great educational and civic opportunities for the community. One of the hallmarks would be opening it up to the adjacent community. Obviously, everyone who is making a bid thinks they have an idea about how to do that.\"\n\nNow that the Lake Shore Drive southern extension is complete, McCaffery is pitching the largest undeveloped parcel in Chicago - a 600-acre site between 79th and 87th streets - as the library's home. The developer, who has entered into a joint venture with U.S. Steel to build a $4 billion residential and business community called Chicago Lakeside, has yet to break ground on a single structure.\n\nThe library would be built at the north end of the property overlooking the lake. The remote location - more than 15 miles from downtown - and the lack of public transportation access should not eliminate the site from consideration, McCaffery said.\n\n\"Accessibility is going to be key. But it's not accessibility from Winnetka. It's accessibility from Nairobi, from Dublin, from Moscow,\" said McCaffery. \"So 99.9 percent of the accessibility is answered by the fact that we have one of the finest airports.\"\n\nMarshall Brown, an assistant professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, said location is important because presidential libraries have only a limited ability to attract large numbers of people on their own.\n\nBrown, who led graduate students in a semester-long project to evaluate potential spots for the library in Chicago and to design their own ambitious visions for the campus, cited President John F. Kennedy's library, which sits on a peninsula jutting into a bay in Boston, as an example.\n\n\"The (Kennedy) library, which has been sitting on Columbia Point in Boston since the 1980s, has attracted very little energy,\" Brown said. \"There's a limit to how remote these facilities can be before they're actually not that effective at attracting large numbers of people or economic development.\"\n\nPaula Robinson, president of the Black Metropolis National Heritage Area Commission, said a presidential library on the Michael Reese Hospital site would be a big boost to the neighborhood's efforts to make Bronzeville an international African-American heritage tourist destination.\n\nCity planners have looked at the Michael Reese site for other possible uses, including for a casino and convention hotels. If Chicago had won its bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Olympic Village would have been built on the site, which is south of downtown and close to the lake. Consultants to the city have recommended that a Metra station be moved there to aid redevelopment.\n\nWith so many cultural assets already in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood - from blues musician Muddy Waters' home to Pilgrim Baptist Church, designed by famed architect Louis Sullivan - the library would be a perfect fit and have a trickle-down effect on existing businesses, Robinson said.\n\n\"If there's a library on 31st Street, everybody is going to want a good place to eat or buy souvenirs. We can say, 'Check out Muddy Waters Drive a few blocks away. There's great stuff there.' That's economic development.\"\n\nIndeed, presidential libraries have driven revitalization before. The Clinton library in Little Rock, Ark., sparked more than $2 billion in development along the downtown riverfront since the library was announced in 1994. More than half of it came before the library opened in 2005.\n\n\"It has transformed downtown Little Rock and had a positive impact on housing,\" said James \"Skip\" Rutherford, a friend of Bill Clinton's who served as the local planning coordinator and was a member of the library foundation. \"It changed the scope of downtown, which continues to expand and grow, and it became Arkansas' gateway to the world in terms of access to tourism that had been needed in the state for a long time.\"\n\nChoosing the right spot wasn't easy. Once Clinton selected Little Rock, community groups, developers and universities came up with 40 potential sites, which a committee of city officials narrowed to five finalists. Unlike the Barack Obama Foundation, Clinton's foundation did not require formal bids.\n\n\"What we did was allow everybody who thought they had a good idea for a site to present it and have it considered,\" said Rutherford, now dean of the University of Arkansas School of Public Service, which is part of the Clinton Presidential Center. \"There were people saying they wanted it as an economic engine in residential neighborhoods. President Clinton wanted his library to be not only an economic engine but to stimulate growth in tourism and research, more than just a single-source destination stuck out in the middle of a field someplace.\"\n\nRutherford was among those who visited each site, looking at access, parking, cost of rehabbing the land, and proximity to hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions. In the end, Clinton selected the old warehouse district downtown on the banks of the Arkansas River.\n\n\"The one chosen had an economic impact on the entire city,\" Rutherford said.\n\nThe area known as the River Market District averages more than 300,000 visitors a year, according to Sharon Priest, executive director of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership. One reason, she said, is that there are other attractions, such as museums and entertainment venues, also in the area.\n\nRevitalizing a downtown area used by the entire city is very different from turning around a neighborhood that has limited scope, real estate experts said. A presidential library cannot be a panacea for a neighborhood that has experienced decades of neglect.\n\nOver the past half-century, Washington Park has experienced a 79 percent decrease in population, dwindling to just over 11,000 residents. Some of the population decline can be attributed to the 2007 demolition of the Robert Taylor Homes, one of the largest concentrations of public housing in the country.\n\nA third of the property in Washington Park is vacant and the neighborhood has the city's highest commercial vacancy rate at 26 percent, according to a 2012 assessment commissioned by the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nThe Green Line station has parking, and the area is surrounded by vacant lots and abandoned homes that could be acquired if more land is needed for the library. Burke Elementary School sits nearby at King Drive at 54th Street. The few restaurants in the immediate area are mostly fast food. On a recent afternoon, the only shopping taking place was in an adjacent parking lot, where vendors sold blankets, clothes and household items from the back of a truck.\n\nThe sprawling Washington Park, part of the Chicago Park District, is on the other side of King Drive. Chicago's unrealized plans for the Olympics envisioned an 80,000-seat stadium there.\n\n\"Can a library suddenly change a place? The answer is no. But nothing else can either,\" said Robert Weissbourd, a former ShoreBank executive who is an expert on urban development. \"Can a library of this scope in conjunction with other things that it both enables and that naturally flow from it change a neighborhood? The answer is yes.\"\n\nThe library would have a positive effect on the path of any neighborhood it is placed in, Weissbourd said. But its economic impact will depend on what other activities it leverages. And that requires a bigger plan.\n\nThe market won't build on its own in a neighborhood far away from downtown, he said. Retailers, developers and infrastructure won't automatically come to Washington Park like they would to a neighborhood like Bronzeville, which is closer to downtown and the vibrant lakefront.\n\n\"If you put it in ... Washington Park, you will have a bigger upside, but you have to do more,\" Weissbourd said. \"You have a bigger chance for it to be a catalyst for market activity and a bigger turnaround, but you have to make sure you're putting in the infrastructure for that to occur.\"\n\nUltimately, when it comes to determining the kind of economic engine the library will be, the president will be the driving force, Rutherford said.\n\n\"Nobody is going to put the Obama library in a place the president didn't want it to go,\" he said. \"It didn't happen with President (George W.) Bush, Ronald Reagan or any of them.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - In a rare Oval Office address, President Barack Obama vowed Sunday night the United States will overcome a new phase of the terror threat that seeks to \"poison the minds\" of people here and around the world, as he sought to reassure Americans shaken by recent attacks in Paris and California.\n\n\"I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure,\" he said, speaking from a lectern in his West Wing office. \"The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it,\" he declared.\n\nThe president's speech followed Wednesday's shooting in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people and wounded 21. Authorities say a couple carried out the attack and the wife pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader in a Facebook post.\n\nObama said that while there was no evidence the shooters were directed by a terror network overseas or part of a broader plot, \"the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization.\"\n\n\"This was an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people,\" he said in the 13-minute address.\n\nIn speaking from the Oval Office, Obama turned to a tool of the presidency that he has used infrequently. His decision to speak in prime time reflected the White House's concern that his message on the recent attacks hasn't broken through, particularly in the midst of a heated presidential campaign.\n\nYet Obama's speech was likely to leave his critics unsatisfied. He announced no significant shift in U.S. strategy and offered no new policy prescriptions for defeating the Islamic State, or ISIS, underscoring both his confidence in his current approach and the lack of easy options for countering the extremist group.\n\n\"Nothing that happened in the speech tonight is going to assuage people's fears,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, said on Fox News.\n\nObama did call for cooperation between private companies and law enforcement to ensure potential attackers cannot use technology to evade detection. He also urged Congress to pass new force authorization for military actions underway against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and also to approve legislation to bar guns from being sold to people on a no-fly list.\n\nAnd he implored Americans to not turn against Muslims at home, saying the Islamic State is driven by a desire to spark a war between the West and Islam. Still, he called on Muslims in the United States and around the world to take up the cause of fighting extremism.\n\nThe spread of radical Islam into American communities, he said, is \"a real problem that Muslims must confront without excuse.\"\n\nThe president's most specific policy announcement was to order the departments of State and Homeland Security to review the fiance visa program that the female shooter in California used to enter the U.S. In his remarks, Obama referred to a visa waiver program that Congress is also reviewing, but the White House later clarified he meant the fiance program\n\nHe also reiterated his call for broader gun control legislation, saying no matter how effective law enforcement and intelligence agencies are, they can't identify every would-be shooter. He called it a matter of national security to prevent potential killers from getting guns.\n\n\"What we can do, and must do, is make it harder for them to kill,\" he said.\n\nObama stands little chance of getting the Republican-led Congress to agree to any gun control measures. On Thursday, the Senate rejected legislation barring people the government suspects of acts of terror from purchasing firearms. Gun rights advocates say such a ban would violate the rights of people who haven't been convicted of crimes.\n\nCongress also has been unable to coalesce behind any plan to authorize more force against ISIS, and the administration's proposal has languished since February.\n\nObama repeated his long-standing opposition to an American-led ground war in the Middle East and made no mention of the more aggressive action others have suggested, including enforcing a no-fly zone and safe corridors in Syria.\n\n\"Our success won't depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values or giving in to fear,\" he said. \"Instead, we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless.\"\n\nAfter the speech, the president appeared as previously scheduled at the Kennedy Center Honors tribute in Washington.\n\nThe president's critics - and increasingly, some members of his own party - have questioned his strategy. Hours before he spoke, Hillary Clinton - his former secretary of state and the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination - said the U.S. is \"not winning\" the fight against ISIS.\n\nObama has insisted that the Islamic State is contained in Iraq and Syria. However, the group has set its sights elsewhere in the world, launching attacks in Lebanon and Turkey and downing a Russia airliner over Egypt.\n\nThe Nov. 13 attacks in Paris marked the group's most aggressive actions in Europe, a coordinated effort that left 130 people dead and wounded hundreds more.\n\nLast week, the terror threat drew even closer for Americans when a couple - a 29-year-old woman originally from Pakistan and her 28-year-old American-born husband - launched an attack on a holiday luncheon in San Bernardino.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the massacre as an act of terror that, if proved, would be the deadliest by Islamic extremists on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe woman pledged allegiance to ISIS and its leader in a Facebook post, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A Facebook official said the post came about the time the couple stormed the San Bernardino social service center.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama is ordering up new rules for giving local police agencies access to surplus U.S. military equipment such as the armored vehicles, assault rifles and body armor that police in Ferguson, Missouri, used during protests this summer.\n\nObama is also proposing a three-year, $263 million spending package to expand training and increase the use of body-worn cameras for monitoring police interactions with the public. The proposal includes $75 million that would provide matching funds for purchasing as many as 50,000 cameras. Such cameras might have provided more information in the deadly August shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson.\n\nThe president's directive comes along with the release of a new White House review that found the so-called \"surplus\" programs of the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to be a mishmash of rules and practices, with no clear sign that all police are properly trained and certified to use the military-grade equipment they receive.\n\nThe results of the review come a week after a grand jury in St. Louis County chose not to indict the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. The shooting inflamed local tensions and led to unrest that brought attention to the use of military-grade equipment by local law enforcement officials in their response. Protests around the country and in Ferguson began anew last week in the wake of the grand jury's decision.\n\nWith the report newly in hand, Obama is instructing his staff to come up with a list of military gear that has a legitimate civilian law enforcement purpose and thus can be sent to local police forces around the country, senior administration officials said Monday.\n\nThe new rules will also require that local officials review and authorize the acquisition of small arms and all other \"controlled\" equipment by their communities, and that police be specially trained in their civilian use.\n\nThe rules will come within the next four months in the form of an executive order governing the Pentagon and all other federal agencies that run the surplus programs that distribute military-style equipment to police around the country.\n\n\"What he's asking his agencies to do is add a very specific layer of accountability,\" said one senior administration official familiar with the program. \"These layers of accountability aren't currently present in the program.\"\n\nIn the case of Ferguson, the use of military equipment served only to escalate the conflict between police and protesters angry about the shooting.\n\nAs community leaders demanded to know why the police turned out at peaceful protests with riot gear and equipment, Obama ordered a White House review of the rules that govern the distribution of that material.\n\nThe new report identifies a \"lack of consistency\" in how the various federal programs are run and audited and raises questions about whether police know how to use the military-grade equipment, the senior administration official said.\n\nObama discussed the report's findings, and his new directive, in a series of Monday meetings with his Cabinet, young civil rights leaders and community leaders from around the country.\n\nAt the top of the agenda was finding ways to build trust between police and communities, an aide to the president said.\n\nObama directed his staff to draft an order that requires non-police officials to review and authorize the transfer of equipment, such as small arms and armored vehicles, before it can come to their communities.\n\nPolice forces would have to take part in rigorous training as well as follow-up reports for serious incidents involving the federal equipment, under the order.\n\nIn addition, Obama is setting up a task force to come up with recommendations for fighting crime while still building public trust. Charles H. Ramsey, the Philadelphia police commissioner, and Laurie Robinson, former assistant attorney general for justice programs, will co-chair the panel.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama said Monday the deaths of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York show that law enforcement needs to change practices to build trust in minority communities, as a White House task force called for independent investigations when police use deadly force.\n\nThe president said last year's deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City exposed \"deep-rooted frustration in many communities of color around the need for fair and just law enforcement.\" He said a policing task force that he appointed found it's important for law enforcement to improve training, data collection and cooperation with the communities they cover.\n\n\"The moment is now for us to make these changes,\" Obama said from the White House during a meeting with members of the task force, who worked for three months to develop the recommendations. \"We have a great opportunity coming out of some great conflict and tragedy to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel - rather than being embattled - feel fully supported. We need to seize that opportunity.\"\n\nThe task force made 63 recommendations after holding seven public hearings across the country that included testimony from more than 100 people. The panel also met with leaders of groups advocating for the rights of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, veterans, gays, the disabled and others.\n\nObama said the task force found the need for more police training to reduce bias and help officers deal with stressful situations. He recognized a particularly controversial recommendation would be the need for independent investigations in fatal police shootings.\n\n\"The importance of making sure that there's a sense of accountability when in fact law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to be considering,\" Obama said.\n\nSpecifically, the task force recommended external independent criminal investigations and review by outside prosecutors when police use force that results in death or anyone dies in police custody, instead of the internal investigations that are the policy of some law enforcement agencies. The task force suggested either a multi-agency probe involving state and local investigators, referring an investigation to neighboring jurisdictions or the next higher level of government. \"But in order to restore and maintain trust, this independence is crucial,\" the report said.\n\nBill Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said an outside investigation of a police-involved shooting may make sense in limited circumstances when a police department has few resources. But in the vast majority of cases, he said, it is unnecessary and perhaps even counterproductive.\n\n\"I think it helps to drive a wedge between a local police department and the community it serves - which is exactly contrary to what the intent of this police task force was supposed to be,\" said Johnson, whose organization is an umbrella group of police unions. \"I think it sends a message that your local police can't be trusted.\"\n\nThe task force echoed calls from officials including Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey for more complete record-keeping about the numbers of police-involved shootings across the country. Such data is currently reported by local law enforcement on a voluntary basis, and there is no central or reliable repository for those statistics.\n\n\"There's no reason for us not to have this data available,\" said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, a task force co-chair, who added he was surprised to learn that there were no reliable records kept. \"Now that we know that this does not exist, it is our responsibility to do everything we can to develop that information.\"\n\nRamsey also pointed out that the task force recommended decoupling immigration from local law enforcement to help improve police relationships with immigrant communities where residents may fear calling for help if they or someone in their family is in the country illegally. He said information on immigrant felons would remain available under the panel's recommendations.\n\nObama earlier had called for Congress to help fund the purchase of 50,000 body cameras for police to wear and record their interactions with the public. But the task force found that the cameras raise extraordinarily complex legal and privacy issues.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about body cameras as a silver bullet or a solution,\" Obama said. \"I think the task force concluded that there is a role for technology to play in building additional trust and accountability but it's not a panacea. It has to be embedded in a broader change in culture and a legal framework that ensures that people's privacy is respected.\"\n\nLaurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and co-chair of the task force, told reporters the type of community-police relations envisioned by the report does not happen quickly.\n\n\"It takes time, it takes relationship-building and it doesn't happen overnight,\" she said.'"

Amid public doubts over Obama's stewardship of the economy, the speech served as a guide for the remaining three years of his term.\n\nStill, by drawing attention to past policy proposals that have dead-ended in a divided government, Obama also laid bare the political failures and economic difficulties he has faced trying to halt widening inequality trends.\n\nHe acknowledged his administration's \"poor execution\" in rolling out the flawed health care website that was supposed to be an easy portal for purchasing insurance, while blaming Republicans for a \"reckless\" shutdown of the government.\n\n\"Nobody has acquitted themselves very well these past few months,\" Obama said. \"So it's not surprising that the American people's frustrations with Washington are at an all-time high.\" Worse for Americans, he added, are their growing difficulties in trying to make ends meet no matter how hard they work.\n\nThe speech coincided with growing national and international attention to economic disparities - from the writings of Pope Francis to the protests of fast-food workers in the U.S. Obama recalled the pope's words, the deeds of past presidents as well as his own personal story as a young boy with a financially struggling mother.\n\nAnd he noted that in the United States, a child born into the bottom 20 percent of income levels has less than a 5 percent chance of making it to the top income levels and is 10 times likelier to stay where he is - worse than other industrial countries such as Canada, Germany and France.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner blamed Senate Democrats and Obama for the lack of action on jobs-related legislation. He said bills passed by the Republican-controlled House that would help the economy and create jobs have been blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate. \"The Senate and the president continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities,\" he said on the House floor.\n\nObama conceded that \"the elephant in the room\" is the politicalgridlock that has prevented congressional action. But he pointed to the health care law, despite its troubled enrollment launch, as one example that he said is already helping families by providing insurance coverage to more Americans and by pushing down the costs of health care.\n\nObama specifically called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 an hour. A Democratic bill by Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa would raise the threshold to $10.10 an hour in three steps and tie automatic annual increases to changes in the cost of living.\n\nA vote in the Senate is not expected in December, when the chamber will mostly focus on stalemates over the budget and other issues. Whenever it is debated, the measure seems unlikely to win the 60 votes it would need to clear the Senate due to GOP opposition.\n\nObama also pressed Congress to extend jobless benefits to 1.3 million long-term unemployed people. The benefits are set to expire just three days after Christmas. The additional weeks of benefits have been extended each year since 2009, but a senior Republican lawmaker, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, said Tuesday that lawmakers in his party oppose yet another extension.'"

Crowds of people danced and waved.\n\nObama seemed to claim Senegal too, shaking hands and posing for pictures, but also acknowledging the dark history of slavery the country shares with the United States.\n\nThe president and his family visited a small slave house on Goree Island off the coast of Dakar, the nation's capital, where it is said men, women and children were traded, sorted, shackled and weighed before being sent across the Atlantic to the Americas.\n\nThe president stared pensively out the \"door of no return,\" described as the exit for those boarding slave ships, while spending about half an hour in the two-story salmon-colored house filled with dark holding cells.\n\n\"Obviously, for an African-American - and an African-American president - to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of the defense of human rights around the world,\" Obama said afterward.\n\n\"I think more than anything, what it reminds us of is that we have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of people's human rights - because I'm a firm believer that humanity is fundamentally good, but it's only good when good people stand up for what's right,\" he said.\n\nOther U.S. presidents and their families have toured Goree Island, but the Obamas were the first to make the visit with the knowledge that their ancestors had experienced such cruelty.\n\nObama, whose Kansan mother is believed to have had at least one slave among her ancestors, was accompanied by first lady Michelle Obama, whose great-great-grandfather was freed from a South Carolina plantation; his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson; and his daughter Malia.\n\nThe first family has rarely commented on the revelations about their forebears, which have largely come from outside researchers who have made studying the first family's genealogy a cottage industry, but the president described the visit as a meaningful experience.\n\nHe said it was especially powerful for his family \"to be able to come here and to fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade, to get a sense in a very intimate way of the incredible inhumanity and hardship that people faced before they made the Middle Passage and that crossing.\"\n\nMichelle Obama did not comment on the family's private tour of Goree Island.\n\nThe slave house on Goree Island is a frequent destination for celebrities and world leaders wanting to acknowledge the horrors of the international slave trade. The walls of the small, crowded gift shop are covered with faded images and yellowing newspaper clippings of visitors: Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as former South African President Nelson Mandela and entertainers Harry Belafonte and Stevie Wonder.\n\nHistorians have debated whether the slave house at Goree Island was actually a major slave trading post. Some historians have suggested the dusty island was largely a shipping stop, and the slave house, built in 1776 by the Dutch, may have primarily served as a merchant's home.\n\nStill, the symbolic significance remains a powerful draw. For the equivalent of a dollar, Goree Island tour guides tell stories of slaves to visitors, describing the moment Africans may have passed through the door for the last time before, as one put it, \"bye-bye Africa.\"\n\nEloi Coly, the curator of the slave house who led the president's tour, said the weight of that moment hits visitors of all races.\n\n\"It is impossible not to feel - it is a question of being a human being,\" Coly said. \"It is very difficult for everybody. No matter the position of who is visiting the slave house.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, Obama praised the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings the day before on same-sex marriages, but was not joined by Senegalese President Macky Sall in celebrating gay rights. Sall said Senegal is tolerant but that the issue requires greater review.\n\n\"We are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality,\" Sall said, according to news reports. \"This does not mean we are homophobic.\"'"

            "title": "Obama delays Syria vote, says diplomacy may work",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address Tuesday night that recent diplomatic steps offer \"the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons\" inside Syria without the use of force, but he also insisted the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad \"and be ready to respond\" if other measures fail.\n\nSpeaking from the East Room of the White House, Obama said he had asked congressional leaders to postpone a vote on legislation he has been seeking to authorize the use of military force against Syria.\n\nAcknowledging the weariness the nation feels after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama said, \"America is not the world's policeman.\"\n\nAnd yet, he added, \"When with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional.\"\n\n\"Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria,\" he declared.\n\nThe speech capped a frenzied 10-day stretch of events that began when he unexpectedly announced he was stepping back from a threatened military strike and first asking Congress to pass legislation authorizing the use of force against Assad.\n\nWith public opinion polls consistently showing widespread opposition to American military intervention, the White House has struggled mightily to generate support among lawmakers - liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike - who have expressed fears of involvement in yet another war in the Middle East and have questioned whether U.S. national security interests were at stake in Syria. Obama had trouble, as well, building international support for a military attack designed to degrade Assad's military.\n\nSuddenly, though, events took another unexpected turn this week. First Russia and then Syria reacted positively to a seemingly off-hand remark from Secretary of State John Kerry indicating that the crisis could be defused if Damascus agreed to put its chemical weapons under international control.\n\nThe president said he was sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday, and he added, \"I will continue my own discussion\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAt the same time, he said the United States and its allies would work with Russia and China to present a resolution to the United Nations Security Council \"requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons and to ultimately destroy them under international control.\"\n\nIn a speech that lasted 16 minutes, Obama recounted the events of the deadly chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 that the United States blames on Assad.\n\n\"When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until these horrifying pictures fade from memory. But these things happened. The facts cannot be denied,\" he said.\n\nThe president said firmly that Assad's alleged attack was \"not only a violation of international law, it's also a danger to our security.\"\n\nIf diplomacy now fails and the United States fails to act, he said, \"the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons\" and \"other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using\" it. Over time, he added, U.S. troops could face the threat of chemical warfare, and if fighting escapes Syria's border, \"these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel.\"\n\nThe president sought to deal methodically with what he said were questions asked by lawmakers and citizens who took the time to write him with their concerns about U.S. military action.\n\n\"I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria,\" he promised. \"I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.\n\n\"This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the president's speech, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointedly told a congressional hearing it was not time to let the threat of military retaliation lapse. \"For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue,\" he declared.\n\nAt the same hearing, Kerry said any diplomacy \"cannot be a process of delay. This cannot be a process of avoidance.\"\n\nHe later added that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply, and lawmakers moved to rewrite pending legislation along the same lines.\n\nObama himself \"wasn't overly optimistic about\" prospects for a solution at the U.N., said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, after his party's rank and file met privately for lunch in the Capitol with the president. He quoted Obama as saying that even if a credible plan could be worked out, it could be difficult to push through the U.N. Security Council. And, indeed, Russian President Putin said such a U.N. effort could work only if \"the American side and those who support the USA in this sense reject the use of force.\"\n\nThe president readied his speech as a small crowd of anti-war protesters, some waving signs, gathered outside the gates of the White House.\n\nU.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the Aug. 21 episode, including at least 400 children, and other victims suffered uncontrollable twitching, foaming at the mouth and other symptoms typical of exposure to chemical weapons banned by international treaty. Other casualty estimates are lower, and Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 100,000 civilians.\n\nAssad's patron, Russia, has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike. But Monday, after a remark by Kerry, it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons, and the Syrian foreign minister did likewise.\n\nThe foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia's proposal in order \"to thwart U.S. aggression.\" He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical convention it has long rejected - a step it can take on its own at any time without U.S. or U.N. supervision.\n\nSyria has long refused to provide an accounting of the size of its stockpile, rarely referring in public to its existence. According to an unclassified estimate by the French government, it includes more than 1,000 tons of \"chemical agents and precursor chemicals,\" including sulfur mustard, VX and sarin gas.\n\nObama has said frequently he has the authority as commander in chief to order a military strike against Assad regardless of any vote in Congress.\n\nThe response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best - as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., both announced their opposition.\n\nMarkey, who was elected to the seat that Kerry vacated when he joined the Cabinet, said the legislation under consideration was too broad, \"the effects of a strike are too unpredictable, and ... I believe we must give diplomatic measures that could avoid military action a chance to work.\"\n\nSaid Mulvaney: \"While I am concerned about taking no action, it strikes me that international law cannot be upheld via unilateral attack by the United States.\"\n\nAnd Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on committees dealing both with military and intelligence matters, said he feared that \"Iran and Russia could cause serious damage\" to the United States if they retaliated with a cyberattack.\n\nYet Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said, \"It would be inimical to our country's standing if we do not show a willingness to act in the face of the use of chemical weapons and to act in a limited way to address that use alone.\"\n\nHours before Obama's speech from the White House's East Room, Hoyer added, \" I don't think there's any doubt that failure to do so would weaken our country, create a more dangerous international environment and to some degree undermine the president of the United States.\"\n\nEarlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes. \"There are just too many unanswered questions about our long-term strategy in Syria,\" he said.\n\nBy contrast, Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, the top two Republicans in the House, have endorsed Obama's request.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of diplomatic maneuvering, no vote is expected for several days, if then.\n\n\"If something can be done diplomatically, I'm totally satisfied with that. I'm not a blood and thunder guy. I'm not for shock and awe,\" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in a reference to the massive display of firepower that opened the war in Iraq nearly a decade ago.\n\nStill, there was ample skepticism in Congress about the United Nations as well as Russia's true intentions, as well as Syria's willingness to be bound by international agreements.\n\n\"There is an overwhelming view it would be preferable if international law and the family of nations could strip Syria of the chemical weapons,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"And there's a large view we should let that process play out for a little while.\"\n\nSaid Boehner: \"Clearly, diplomacy is always a better outcome than military action. But I will say that I'm somewhat skeptical of those that are involved in the diplomatic discussions today.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - While President Barack Obama's popularity has slipped in public opinion polls, he found plenty of support Wednesday among one key constituency: the 566 leaders of federally recognized Indian tribes.\n\n\"I'd rank him as high as I can go; a 10, really, to be honest with you,\" said Leo Lolnitz, first chief of the Koyukuk Native Village in Alaska.\n\nBrian Cladoosby, the chairman of Washington state's Swinomish Indian Tribal Community for the past 17 years, said Obama was \"second to none\" when compared with other U.S. presidents.\n\nTribal leaders consider the occupant of the White House one of their own. To them, he's Barack Black Eagle Obama, having received his Indian name in 2008 when a couple on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana formally adopted him. And on Wednesday, they got a chance to meet with him yet again, as the president kept a campaign promise by hosting his fifth White House Tribal Nations Conference.\n\nIn a 14-minute speech to the tribal leaders, Obama said he'd make his first visit to [Indian Country](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) as president sometime next year, though he didn't say where he plans to go. He visited the Montana reservation when he was challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in his first presidential campaign.\n\nThe annual gathering at the Interior Department gives tribal leaders a chance to make pitches for what they want from Washington in the coming year. In 2014, tribal leaders want an end to the budget cuts known as sequestration and more authority to manage their own affairs, among other things.\n\nA dozen Cabinet officials met with the tribal leaders, promising more help for such challenges as fighting crime, fixing schools and getting better health care.\n\nBut some tribal leaders said the president and his team had too quick to promise and slow to deliver.\n\n\"He's reaching out to us. We really appreciate that, but there's not a whole lot of things that have happened,\" said Bryan Brewer, the president of South Dakota's Oglala Sioux Tribe. \"I feel there's been a lot of promises to us, but we're still struggling.\"\n\nFor example, Brewer said, Obama should have done more to protect tribes from the cuts caused by sequestration: \"We should have been exempted from a lot of those things, but we haven't.\"\n\nObama and his team outlined their list of accomplishments, including: renewing the Violence Against Women Act, which makes it easier for tribes to prosecute non-Indians for domestic violence; getting an additional 230,000 acres placed into trust on behalf of the tribes; spending more on law enforcement, schools and emergency relief; launching a nearly $2 billion buyback program later this year to return thousands of property parcels to tribes; and creating the first White House Council on Native American Affairs.\n\nInterior Secretary Sally Jewell, who oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said the forced budget cuts and last month's 16-day government shutdown had hit Indian Country hard. But she told the tribal leaders that the Obama administration is determined to help \"make your world a better place\" despite the tough fiscal climate.\n\n\"I know from growing up in this country that the federal government does not have a proud legacy with tribes, and justice can't be reversed overnight,\" Jewell said.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that only 36 percent of tribal members were covered by health insurance now but that 94 percent would be covered either under an expansion of Medicaid or by enrolling through the new marketplace created by the president's health insurance program. She said the new federal law provided \"a pathway\" for more tribal members to get insured.\n\nEric Shinseki, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, acknowledged that some veterans lack trust in the government and his department but said he wanted to make things better and ensure that all tribal members got equal access to benefits for veterans.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder said the administration wanted to do more to reduce crime in Indian Country, including the rates of rape and murder, which he said were far too high among girls and women.\n\n\"We simply can't stand for such an unjust and unacceptable status quo any longer,\" he said.\n\nObama said the poverty rate was too high in Indian Country and that the federal government must do more to expand job opportunities. And he said he wanted to build a stronger relationship between tribes and the federal government, \"based on trust and respect.\"\n\nThe president said he also wanted to make it easier for more tribal members to get access to health care. He saluted the Puyallup Tribal Health Authority in Washington state, where he said tribal members had created the country's first tribal family-medicine residency program.\n\n\"Patients are cared for in a culturally sensitive way, often by Native American staff,\" Obama said.\n\nTribes outlined a long list of their own priorities, including getting more help with economic development projects, appointing more tribal members to judgeships and other high-level federal jobs, spending more on housing and collecting better data to track tribal members.\n\nArlan Melendez, the tribal chairman of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony in Nevada, said tribal leaders wanted to urge the administration to get the Internal Revenue Service to stop conducting audits on Indian land.\n\n\"Tribes think it's an intrusion on sovereign federal land,\" he said.\n\nJim Peters, a tribal council member of the Squaxin Island Tribe in Washington state, gave Obama high marks for helping to advance conservation and fisheries management issues, even with a tight federal budget. And he said tribes wanted to make sure they did as much as they could to advance the efforts during Obama's final three years in office.\n\n\"With our treaty rights at risk back in Washington, he has been listening to us and directing his agencies to work with us,\" Peters said.\n\nCladoosby, the Swinomish chairman, who's also the president of the National Congress of American Indians, noted that after Wednesday's event Obama has now met with tribal leaders each year of his presidency. The chairman said that was unprecedented.\n\n\"The tribes got one meeting with President Clinton,\" Cladoosby said. \"During the Bush administration, we got zero meetings.\"'"

            "text": "\tUNITED NATIONS - President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on world leaders meeting at the United Nations to \"choose hope over fear\" by fighting sectarian conflict and extremism, beginning with the militant group Islamic State (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq but branching out beyond the Middle East.\n\nThe militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.\n\nIn a morning address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Obama urged leaders to support Iraqis and Syrians as they fight to reclaim their communities. He also argued the merits of the new military campaign he is running against ISIL, as well as al-Qaida and its offshoots.\n\n\"No God condones this terror,\" Obama said. \"No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning - no negotiation - with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.\"\n\nObama also pointed to a range of aggressive acts around the world - singling out Russian aggression in Ukraine - as part of a sweeping summons to cooperation over conquest.\n\nHe pledged to back Ukraine and its democratic development and to uphold the U.S. commitment to the collective defense of NATO allies. He promised to help stop the outbreak of the Ebola virus ravaging West Africa.\n\nBut mainly the president's remarks were his first chance to put the dramatic events of the previous 48 hours, not to mention a summer of global turmoil, in context. They followed a second night of bombing against ISIL targets in Syria.\n\nThe Pentagon said it hit and damaged eight ISIL vehicles northwest of Al Qa'im in Syria, while bombers and aircraft conducted four strikes on targets near Baghdad and Irbil in Iraq. Videos posted on social media early Wednesday showed Syrian civilians picking through rubble of destroyed homes, and Syrian activists reported civilian casualties.\n\nThe world, Obama said, must take concrete steps to address the danger of \"religiously motivated fanatics\" and the trends that fuel their recruitment.\n\nRather than portraying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the principal source of broader Middle East problems, as he has in the past, Obama emphasized the need for leaders in Muslim communities to fight the ideology of al-Qaida and ISIL.\n\nExtremist ideology is shifting to places in the Middle East and North Africa where there are shortages not just of jobs and prosperity but of food, water and security, he said.\n\n\"It is the task of all great religions to accommodate devout faith with a modern, multicultural world,\" Obama said. \"No children anywhere should be educated to hate other people. There should be no more tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because they are Jewish, Christian or Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source: the corruption of young minds by violent ideology.\"\n\nLater Wednesday, the president was due to chair a meeting of the U.N. Security Council where he would push for a resolution calling on countries to crack down on citizens drawn to such groups.\n\nThe foreign fighters leaving their home countries to join ISIL and other groups should face tougher penalties and greater restrictions on travel, the resolution says.\n\nThe measure is an attempt to showcase some broad agreement among a perpetually deadlocked body and it would have to serve as a stand-in for a broader endorsement of the U.S.-led strikes in Syria. The U.S. did not pursue an authorization for the use of force, faced with an all-but-certain Russian veto.\n\nWithout that authorization, the administration argued Tuesday that the strikes were consistent with the U.N. charter because Iraq was under direct threat from militants in Syria and had sought U.S. assistance.\n\nWhile Obama used the meeting of global leaders to tout a diplomatic triumph, the setting was also a reminder of how fleeting such moments are.\n\nIn his remarks before the body last year, Obama hailed his success in winning an agreement from Syrian President Bashar Assad to dispose of his nation's chemical weapons stockpile. That breakthrough, Obama said, \"should energize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political settlement within Syria.\"\n\nWednesday's remarks reflected the dramatic changes of the last year.\n\n\"We will use our military might in a campaign of airstrikes to roll back ISIL,\" Obama said. \"We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region.\"\n\nHe added, \"Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats; and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build - not those who destroy.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama called Wednesday for a foreign policy that downplays military intervention in favor of diplomacy and international partnerships, defending his approach as better suited to a world grappling with global threats of terror.\n\n\"This is American leadership. This is American strength,\" Obama said of efforts to work with Europe to isolate Russia for its intervention in Ukraine and to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear pursuit. He acknowledged that neither crisis has yet been resolved, but argued there's an opportunity to resolve them peacefully.\n\nIn a speech before graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York,  the president sought to rebut criticism that his foreign policy has been one of retrenchment, even as he declared that the U.S. remains indispensable and will strike if its interests are threatened.\n\n\"America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one else will,\" he said, telling the cadets that the U.S. military \"is and always will be the backbone of that leadership.\"\n\nThe speech comes amid criticism that Obama's cautious approach to conflict has emboldened U.S. adversaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who annexed Ukraine's Crimea region earlier this year despite the threat of sanctions.\n\nBut Obama argued that a military response \"cannot be the only or even primary\" solution to every conflict.\n\n\"Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail,\" he said.\n\nSince World War II, he said, \"some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures - without thinking through the consequences.\"\n\nThe speech came a day after Obama unveiled his plan to end combat operations in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) by the end of the year. Cadets cheered as the president said they would be the first graduating class since Sept. 11, 2001, not to be sent into combat in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq) or Afghanistan.\n\nObama said he was \"haunted\" by the deaths in Afghanistan of four West Point service members who had been in attendance when he announced an Afghanistan troop surge in 2009.\n\nAnd he said he'd be betraying his duty to them if he rushed into conflict \"because I was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for America to avoid looking weak.\"\n\nThe president did pledge to work with Congress to ramp up support for moderate Syrian opposition groups, but he defended his decision not to send U.S. troops, saying there's \"no military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering anytime soon.\"\n\nA senior White House official said the administration wanted to discuss with Congress the \"potential\" for a U.S. military role in helping Syrian rebels.\n\nObama said the U.S.'s biggest threat was no longer a centralized al-Qaida capable of a large-scale attack on the U.S., but decentralized affiliates and extremists. Many have agendas focused in countries where they operate, the president said, but they can target U.S. personnel overseas, \"as we saw in Benghazi.\"\n\nObama, who was elected in 2008 in part because of his opposition to the war in Iraq, called it \"naive and unsustainable\" to invade every country that harbors terrorist networks, instead arguing that the U.S. should partner with countries fighting insurgents.\n\nTo that end, he called on Congress to support a proposed $5 billion counterterrorism fund to help countries in the Middle East and North Africa that are fighting extremists, including Yemen, which is battling al-Qaida.\n\nA White House official said that some of the $10 billion to $15 billion a month that was being spent in Afghanistan could be applied to the fund, which would also support a multinational force in Somalia, train a security force and border patrol in Libya and assist French operations in Mali. Both White House officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity as a matter of administration policy.\n\nThe fund would also be used to help Syria's neighbors Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq as they deal with refugees and confront terrorists.\n\nRepublicans said U.S. allies were already concerned with what they said were Obama's failures to live up to his threats.\n\n\"Too often, strong words have been followed by weak actions or no actions,\" said Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"President Obama's diplomatic efforts cannot work if our allies lack confidence in U.S. commitments, and our opponents do not fear U.S. warnings.\"\n\nObama sought to reserve his right to conduct targeted killings such as [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) strikes, saying, \"There are times when those actions are necessary.\" And, so too, is military action, when the U.S. or its allies are in danger, he said.\n\nBut he said the threshold should be higher for crises that \"stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction\" but don't directly threaten the U.S.\n\nIn those cases, he argued, working with other countries is more likely to succeed and \"less likely to lead to costly mistakes.\"\n\nThe president also criticized Republican leaders who have raised doubts about scientific findings that warn of climate change. He told the cadets that [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) will \"shape your time in uniform, as we are called on to respond to refugee flows and natural disasters and conflicts over water and food.\"\n\nHe pledged that the U.S. will be \"out front\" next year in developing a global framework to tackle global warming.\n\nObama's speech is intended to serve as the opening volley to a larger foreign policy push, the White House said.\n\nNext week, the president will travel to Europe to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy invasion and he's expected to meet with Ukrainian officials there.'"

He's also slated to meet with NATO's secretary-general and deliver a speech at the Palais des Beaux-Arts.\n\nThe itinerary, like much of Obama's European trip this week, is expected to be dominated by talk of a new threat on Europe's doorstep. Obama and European leaders are to discuss Russia's armed seizure of the Crimean peninsula and how the West can prevent Moscow from moving farther into Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama repeated threats of more painful economic sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin sends troops into other regions of the former Soviet state. But the president also acknowledged that, for now, Crimea is likely to remain in Russian control. \"There's no expectation that they will be dislodged by force,\" he said in a news conference in The Hague.\n\nStill, Russia's neighbors are looking for assurance that NATO will make good on its obligations to defend them. Other European nations are worried about the effect that broader sanctions would have on their own fragile economies. Obama's remarks later Wednesday are expected to address such concerns, while avoiding the divisive and dated rhetoric of the Cold War era, officials have said.\n\nThe president's visit comes 100 years after the outbreak of World War I, an anniversary being widely marked in Europe. Nearly 400 of the more than 1,000 Americans killed in Belgium in World War I are honored at the grassy, 6-acre battlefield at Flanders.\n\nIn a morning ceremony at the cemetery west of Brussels, Obama, Belgian King Philippe and Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo placed wreaths at a monument erected to the missing dead. In remarks afterward, all three leaders made reference to lessons of the war that apply today.\n\n\"Our countries have learned the hard way that national sovereignty quickly reaches its limits when met with heavily armed adversaries,\" said the king, who noted that his great-grandfather, King Albert, fought in the war.\n\nDi Rupo warned that \"those who ignore the past are taking the risk to relive it.\"\n\nNoting that chemical weapons were used to \"devastating effect\" on Flanders Field, Obama said that today, in Syria and elsewhere, the world still struggles to eradicate their use.\n\n\"We thought we had banished their use to history, and our efforts send a powerful message that these weapons have no place in a civilized world. This is one of the ways that we can honor those who fell here,\" Obama said. \"This visit, this hallowed ground, reminds us that we must never, ever take our progress for granted.\"\n\nThe president also read from the poem that famously memorialized the fighting at Flanders. Written by John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, the verse called on history to carry the legacy of the war forward:\n\n_To you from failing hands we throw_ _The torch; be yours to hold it high_ _If ye break faith with us who die_ _We shall not sleep, though poppies grow_ _In Flanders fields_.'"

            "text": "\tPARIS - France declared a state of emergency and secured its borders Friday night after attackers unleashed a coordinated wave of explosions, gunfire and hostage-taking in Paris that left more than 132 people dead and generated scenes of horror and carnage.\n\nTaken together, the assaults represented the deadliest day of attacks in France since World War II and one of the worst terrorist strikes on Western soil since Sept. 11, 2001. At half a dozen sites across Paris - a soccer stadium, restaurants, a concert hall - the attackers carried out suicide bombings, hurled grenades and shot hostages dead in a frenzy of violence that paralyzed the city. Late into the night and early Saturday morning, heavily armed security forces flooded the streets while panicked residents and tourists sought safety indoors.\n\nFriday was the second time this year that the City of Light has been a scene of mass murder; in January, Islamist gunmen attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, leaving a total of 17 dead.\n\nThe latest violence will only heighten the tension on a continent that is already on edge from the accumulated strain of a historic migration crisis, growing Islamist extremism and increasingly polarized politics.\n\nWorld leaders rushed to condemn the attacks, and French President Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Hollande vowed revenge on the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility. \"We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless,\" Hollande said outside the Bataclan concert hall, scene of the most bloodshed.\n\n\"Because when terrorists are capable of committing such atrocities, they must be certain that they are facing a determined France, a united France, a France that is together and does not let itself be moved, even if today we express infinite sorrow.\"\n\nThe violence was quickly celebrated online by backers of the Islamic State and other extremist groups. The scale and sophistication of the attacks will be likely to prompt questions about how the planning for such an operation evaded the scrutiny of French intelligence services.\n\nUntil the early hours of Saturday morning, some of the gunmen were thought to remain at large. But the Paris prosecutor's office announced Saturday that all eight of the attackers had been killed - one, shot and killed by police, and six of them by detonating explosives. Yet on Sunday, French police said the eighth suspect was urgently being sought.\n\nThe killers traced an arc across the city, targeting lightly secured facilities where tourists and residents had been enjoying the sort of experiences and events that define Friday night in Paris on a cool November evening. Soccer games, concerts and evening meals were all violently disrupted by the sounds of explosions and gunfire.\n\nThe scene of the worst carnage was the 19th-century Bataclan concert hall, one of the city's most famous music venues, where hundreds of people had gathered for a show by an American band, Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nAs attacks reverberated elsewhere in the city, gunmen stormed the building. Witnesses said three or four men, clad in black, used assault rifles to mow down audience members, shooting some as they dove to the floor seeking safety.\n\n\"There are survivors inside,\" a man named Benjamin Cazenoves posted on his Facebook account, saying he was in the hall before police closed in. \"They are cutting down everyone. One by one.\"\n\nPolice surrounded the building and, amid the boom of explosions and rattle of gunfire, moved in. As they did so, the attackers blew themselves up with explosive belts, police said. Inside, officers found evidence of a massacre, with at least 100 people dead, the city's deputy mayor, Patrick Klugman, told CNN.\n\nGovernment personnel guided survivors of the attack, wrapped in gold-colored heat blankets, down the street to waiting buses. Several had blood spattered on their clothing. Some cried. Most declined to talk to reporters.\n\nOne middle-aged woman with brown curly hair and wearing a white sweater called out from the group of survivors to a man on the other side of a police barrier. He rushed over, embraced her, and the pair simply stood, locked in each others' arms, for several minutes.\n\nAt other sites across the city, attacks left dozens more dead. There were conflicting reports of the exact numbers.\n\nOutside a popular cafe, witnesses reported seeing piles of bodies in the street, the cafe windows having been riddled with gunfire.\n\nAt the soccer match, terrified fans gathered on the field, having been barred by authorities from leaving after suicide bombers detonated explosives outside the stadium just north of Paris. The blasts near the stadium prompted authorities to evacuate Hollande, who was among thousands watching a friendly match between France and Germany.\n\nAcross Paris, normal city life came to a halt. Subway lines were shut down, and authorities advised residents to stay indoors. People who had been on the street in areas near the attacks fled in a panic.\n\n\"I was outside smoking a cigarette when I saw some people coming towards us saying an attack was going on at the Bataclan,\" said Charlotte Baudoin, a 29-year-old event manager. \"So everybody ran back inside the restaurant and they locked the doors. We stayed inside for 50 minutes with the lights off. Then they told us to leave, but we did not feel safe on the streets.\"\n\nHollande went on national television Friday night to announce a state of emergency, including restrictions at French borders and the deployment of the army. The president's office said 1,500 French troops would hit the streets of Paris to back up police.\n\nThe border controls came amid growing signs across Europe that the continent's tradition of free movement is at grave risk. Despite rules for passport-free travel, Sweden instituted border checks this week to better control an unprecedented flow of migrants from the Middle East, southern Asia and Africa. Slovenia rolled out razor wire on its border with Croatia.\n\nWhile the new French border controls were expected to be strict, international airlines and trains appeared to still be operating.\n\nIn Washington, a somber President Barack Obama appeared in the White House briefing room to offer condolences and U.S. help \"to bring these terrorists to justice.\"\n\nHe said the wave of violence was not just an assault on France but \"an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share.\"\n\nObama, who was scheduled to leave Saturday for the Group of 20 summit in Turkey, said he spoke with Hollande prior to the attacks.\n\n\"All of Paris needs our prayers tonight,\" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wisconsin, tweeted.\n\nWithin minutes of the first reports on the violence, Islamic State supporters created hashtags hailing \"Paris in flames\" and declaring that \"ISIS is attacking Paris,\" the Vocativ website reported. (ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.)\n\nMary Lou Dorio, the mother of Julian Dorio, the drummer for Eagles of Death Metal, said in an interview that her son and other band members managed to escape the concert hall when the attack there began. However, the fate of several crew members remains unknown, she said.\n\n\"It was awful,\" she said. She added that her son was at a local police station, where he was able to call his wife.\n\n\"It was a bloodbath,\" Julien Pearce, a radio reporter in France, said in an interview with CNN. He said he was at the concert and saw three or four young men dressed in black open fire on the crowd with assault rifles, firing at random as people screamed.\n\n\"They didn't shout anything. They didn't say anything,\" he said of the assailants. \"They were just shooting people.\"\n\nLate on Sunday, France's Defense Ministry said French warplanes had launched a ferocious retaliatory assault on targets in Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State's de facto capital, after coordinating with U.S. defense officials. The ministry said 10 aircraft dropped 20 bombs on facilities used by the militant group.\n\n'"

            "title": "Paul officially launches 2016 presidential bid",
            "text": "\tLOUISVILLE, Ky. - Sen. Rand Paul, the maverick first-term senator who rode a tea party wave from a Kentucky ophthalmology practice to Congress, on Tuesday formally announced a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\"I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back!\" Paul told a crowd at his official campaign launch in Louisville, echoing language he used during his 2010 Senate run. \"We have come to take our country back from the special interests that use Washington as their personal piggy bank, the special interests that are more concerned with their personal welfare than the general welfare.\"\n\nStanding on a stage flanked by American flags, Paul emphasized a message of inclusion and diversity in step with his strategic aim to expand the traditional GOP base.\n\n\"The message of liberty, opportunity and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform or overalls, whether you're white or black, rich or poor,\" Paul said. \"Many Americans, though, are being left behind. The reward of work seems beyond their grasp. Under the watch of both parties - the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer.\"\n\nPaul's announcement makes him the second major Republican candidate to officially jump into the 2016 race, just the first of a string of campaign debuts slated for this month.\n\nA fiercely independent conservative, Paul has drawn notice from the start of his tenure on Capitol Hill, clashing with GOP leadership and introducing his own proposed overhaul for the federal budget. In 2013, the nearly-13-hour filibuster he conducted in opposition to President Obama's drone policy and the nomination of John O. Brennan to head the CIA catapulted him to stardom on the right, especially among younger Republican voters who have craved a new, contrarian voice.\n\nPaul frequently knocked the Republican Party throughout his remarks Tuesday, accusing his own party of being part of the problem while calling for new, smaller-government policies to spur economic growth.\n\n\"Too often when Republicans have won, we've squandered our victory by becoming part of the Washington machine. That's not who I am. That's not why I ran for office the first time just a few years ago,\" he said. \"... It seems to me that both parties and the entire political system are to blame. Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration. And it's now tripling under Barack Obama's watch.\"\n\nAn ophthalmologist who still performs pro bono eye surgeries, Paul did not hold elected office until ascending to the Senate in 2010 - but he's been steeped in politics for his entire life as the scion of one of America's most famous libertarian families. As a college student, Paul once took a semester off from school to work on father Ron Paul's Senate primary campaign in 1984 and was involved with the longtime Texas congressman's other runs for elected office, including his two campaigns for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Kentucky senator is expected to continue the pitch he's made while traveling the country to lay the groundwork for a presidential run: that the Republican Party needs to broaden its appeal to voters who have traditionally shunned it.\n\n\"White, black, brown, rich, poor, with tattoos and without tattoos, with earrings and without earrings,\" Paul told a room packed full of young people in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. \"We need to take our message where it's not been before.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Paul has been known for his unlikely alliances with Democrats. He has co-authored bills on reforming the criminal justice system with Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, and legalizing medical marijuana with Booker and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat. Criminal justice reform has become one of Paul's signature issues, and he has been using it, and a plan to boost economic investment in Detroit, to try to make inroads with black voters.\n\n\"There is still significant segregation in our society,\" Paul said last month at Bowie State University, a traditionally black university in Maryland.\n\nAnd Paul has repeatedly sparred with some of his GOP colleagues, including both Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and likely challenger Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, over foreign policy and other issues. But as he has approached his presidential run, Paul has been mending fences with many Republican colleagues, including his state's senior senator, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell has endorsed Paul's push for a Kentucky presidential caucus, which would allow the junior senator to run for president and his Senate seat simultaneously.\n\nPaul has been looking to broaden his appeal outside of Washington as well, with some of his more notable libertarian stances inching into more traditionally conservative territory as he prepared to run for president. He has been meeting with evangelical pastors to woo the faith community in the important states of Iowa and South Carolina; last month, he told a group of pastors that a moral crisis is leading people to believe that same-sex marriage is acceptable.\n\nOn foreign policy, his tone has softened and his once strident non-interventionist worldview has been shifted away from its perch of ideological purity, with Paul now frequently acknowledging the necessity for a strong national military and the threat of terrorism in the Middle East, in particular in the Islamic State group. Still, he continues to court conservatives who became war weary during George W. Bush's presidency, knowing they are critical to his national support.\n\nPaul has also been tirelessly reaching out to young people, speaking at colleges and universities around the country for the last year and a half. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, Paul runs three times as well among voters younger than 50 than over 50. And he's staking a claim to tech during the 2016 cycle, opening offices in Austin and Silicon Valley and using platforms like Snapchat to win over younger voters who may not respond to traditional political ad buys or outreach efforts. Paul is also trying to tap into the vast well of tech money, holding meetings with big-pocketed potential donors in California and other tech hubs.\n\nPaul's formal campaign launch was at noon at the Galt House, a hotel in downtown Louisville. Over the rest of the week, he plans to barnstorm the four early voting states - New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada - in a \"Stand with Rand\" tour. An adviser said Paul will hit on different themes at each stop: In New Hampshire on Wednesday, he will discuss civil liberties, while on Thursday in South Carolina he will focus on national defense in a speech at the USS Yorktown.\n\nAs his campaign kicks off, Paul will be surrounded by many of the advisers who helped him ascend to the Senate, including his closest aide, Doug Stafford, and longtime Paul family loyalist Jesse Benton. He'll also be joined by Ron Paul, who is not scheduled to speak.\n\nThe senator lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with his wife, Kelley. They have three sons. He attended Baylor University, but did not graduate, and Duke Medical School. At the time, Duke did not require medical students to have an undergraduate degree, a policy that has since changed.\n\nPaul will publish two books this year: \"Taking A Stand\" will come out May 26, and \"Our Presidents and Their Prayers\" will be released in the fall.\n\n\"It's time for a new way, a new set of ideas, a new leader,\" Paul said at CPAC in February, in footage he used in a video released Sunday night. \"Above all, it's time for a new president.\"'"

            "text": "\tADDISON, Texas - Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry opened his second bid for the Republican presidential nomination Thursday, pledging to \"end an era of failed leadership\" and hoping this campaign will go better than his last one.\n\nThe longest-serving governor in Texas history when he left office in January, Perry made his announcement inside a steamy hangar at an airfield outside Dallas, in the company of fellow veterans and a hulking cargo plane like the one he flew for the Air Force.\n\nPerry vowed to help the country rise above its slow economic recovery. During Perry's last seven years in office, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs.\n\n\"I have been tested,\" Perry said. \"I have led the most successful state in America.\"\n\nIn a nod to the tea party, he said: \"Our rights come from God, not from government.\"\n\nThis time, Perry is a decided underdog who has been visiting early voting states for months, hoping to convince voters he deserves another chance.\n\nIn 2012, he announced late, surged in the polls but wilted amid a series of gaffes. He's still trying to live down the \"oops\" he sheepishly uttered in a brain-freeze moment during a debate in the 2012 race when he forgot one of the federal agencies he'd vowed to close as president.\n\nPerry was a ferocious fundraiser before, but his coffers could be hurt this time by two felony indictments he's facing in Austin.\n\nA grand jury indicted him on abuse of power and coercion after he publicly threatened - then carried out - a veto of state funding for public corruption prosecutors. That followed the Democratic head of the unit rebuffing Perry's calls to resign after her arrest for drunken driving.\n\nPerry says the case against him is purely political, but he's been unable to get it dismissed on constitutional grounds - and may eventually have to pause campaigning to appear in court.\n\nIn his speech, Perry savaged the Obama administration for Iraq's decline after U.S. combat troops left, for what he sees as a flawed nuclear deal being negotiated with Iran and for an insecure border with Mexico.\n\n\"A lot of candidates will say the right things,\" Perry said. \"We need a president who has done the right things.\"\n\nAccording to Perry: \"We're at the end of an era of failed leadership.\"\n\nTexas' white-hot job growth was fueled by an oil-and-gas boom, but Perry said his keeping taxes low, restricting regulation and curbing civil litigation awards helped. Perry also distributed millions in state funds, hoping to lure top job creators to Texas - sometimes with few new jobs to show for it.\n\nPerry is playing up his military experience in a GOP field that has few veterans. His announcement featured many well-known veterans, including Marcus Luttrell, a longtime Perry friend and the only survivor of a four-man team attacked in Afghanistan. Luttrell's story was featured in the 2013 film \"Lone Survivor.\"\n\nPerry's launch was somewhat overshadowed Thursday by confirmation that top-tier prospect Jeb Bush also will run, bringing the Republican presidential field to 11.\n\nOne rival, fellow Texan Ted Cruz, welcomed Perry to the race as \"a friend and patriot.\"\n\nPerry, though, indirectly swiped at senators such as Cruz and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as others in the race with little or no executive experience. \"Leadership is not a speech on the Senate floor,\" he said.\n\nFrom Texas, Perry soon plans to head back to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - early voting states where he has already been active.\n\nHe's hoping the on-the-ground politicking proves more sustainable this time than the early sizzle last time.\n\n\"He's kind of been freed up to be Rick Perry again,\" said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas political consultant and veteran of tea party-backed FreedomWorks. \"That's going to give him a lot of freedom to do what he does best, which is talk to voters one on one, shake hands.\"\n\nPerry, he said, \"shouldn't feel the need to start out trying to be larger than life.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The U.S. has become significantly less Christian in the last eight years as the share of American adults who espouse no systematic religious belief increased sharply, a major new study found.\n\nFor what is likely the first time in U.S. history - certainly the first since the early days of the country - the actual number of American Christians has declined. Christianity, however, remains by far the nation's dominant religious tradition, according to the new report by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\nThe erosion in traditional religious ranks seems likely to continue. Among Americans aged 18 to 33, just slightly more than half identify as Christian, compared with roughly 8 in 10 in the baby boom generation and older age groups, the report shows.\n\nMoreover, in a reverse of previous patterns, those younger Americans do not appear to be adhering more to traditional faiths as they become parents. Just the opposite seems to be happening - members of the millennial generation have grown less religious as they age.\n\nThe rapid increase in the number of adults without ties to traditional religious institutions has strong implications for other social institutions and for politics.\n\nWhether a person attends religious services regularly is among the strongest predictors of how he or she will vote, with traditional religion strongly tied to the Republican Party, at least among white Americans.\n\nThe decline in traditional religious belief adds to the demographic challenges facing the GOP, which already faces difficulties because of its reliance on white voters in a country that has grown more racially diverse.\n\nThe interaction between religion and politics may work both ways. Some scholars believe that close ties between traditional religion and conservatism, particularly on issues such as same-sex marriage, have led many younger Americans to cut their ties with organized religion.\n\nOpposition to same-sex marriage on the part of religious conservatives \"is turning off so many people from Christianity,\" said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College who specializes in studying secularism. \"We're seeing a backlash\" against the linking of religion and politics, he said.\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 American adults were raised in a religious tradition but are now unaffiliated, the study found. By contrast, only 4 percent have moved in the other direction.\n\nA leading conservative religious figure, however, said he thought the trend could be a positive development. People who once would have been \"pretend Christian\" are now being more honest about their beliefs, said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nChurches should not try to water down their beliefs on issues such as marriage in order to appeal to a broader audience, he said, adding that \"almost-Christianity not only isn't authentic; it's dangerous to people's souls.\"\n\n\"I think this gives us a great opportunity for the church to free itself from its American civic religion captivity and to be the church again,\" Moore said. \"The worst thing we can do is respond to the changing culture with pandering.\"\n\nBecause the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask questions about religion, the massive religion surveys by the Pew Research Center have become a chief source of information on the U.S. religious landscape.\n\nThe current survey questioned 35,071 U.S. adults last summer. Its huge size allows detailed analysis of even fairly small religious groups. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus six-tenths of a percentage point.\n\nThe study finds the U.S. still far more religious than most other economically advanced countries. But the significant increase in the share of Americans who do not follow a traditional religious belief mirrors trends in Europe and elsewhere.\n\n\"It's becoming much more possible, much more viable, to identify as secular\" in the U.S. today, Zuckerman said. In previous generations, a lack of religious affiliation was viewed as a mark of being un-American, he said. Now \"people are starting to see being nonreligious as an OK option.\"\n\nNationwide, just short of 1 in 4 Americans describe themselves as being agnostic, atheist or simply \"nothing in particular,\" up from roughly 1 in 6 in 2007, according to the new study. The ranks of the \"nones,\" as the study labels them, have grown in large part from people abandoning the religion in which they were raised.\n\nThat trend toward more secularism is particularly strong in the West, where \"unaffiliated\" is now the single largest religious grouping, at 28 percent, compared with 23 percent who identify as Catholic, 22 percent evangelical Protestant and 11 percent as mainline Protestant, the Pew data show. By comparison, the South remains the most heavily Christian part of the nation.\n\nAlthough younger Americans are much more likely to have no religion than are older generations, the decline in organized religious belief has affected nearly all population groups - native born and immigrant; whites, blacks and Latinos; college educated and non-college educated, the Pew data found.\n\nThe decline, however, has been sharpest among Americans born since the mid-1960s. And in those groups, organized religion does not appear to be gaining adherents as people age. In 2007, for example, about one-quarter of Americans aged 18 to 26 said they had no religion. Today, in that same age cohort, now 25 to 33, just over one-third say they have no religion.\n\n\"If you work in the church, you see it happening. We have growing numbers of congregations that are having a hard time retaining their membership numbers,\" said Bishop R. Guy Erwin of the Southwest California Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, based in Glendale, California.\n\n\"The people who are churchgoers are an aging generation, and they're not being replaced by younger people,\" he said. \"We can't just assume that we can do the same old stuff and still be successful.\"\n\nMarried people are more likely to have a religious affiliation than the unmarried, but both groups have grown less attached to organized religion in recent years, the Pew data show. Among married adults, 18 percent describe themselves as religious \"nones,\" while among the unmarried, 28 percent do. Those who are unmarried but living with a partner are particularly likely to be unaffiliated.\n\nBy contrast with the growth of the religiously unaffiliated, Christian ranks have eroded. Roughly 173 million adult Americans identify as Christian, just under 71 percent of the U.S. population. That's down from 178 million, or 78 percent of the U.S., in 2007. The total U.S. adult population grew by about 8 percent during that eight-year period.\n\nProtestants, who once dominated the U.S. population, no longer form a majority, the study found. About 47 percent of the U.S. population identifies with some Protestant denomination, down from just over half in 2007.\n\nThe decline has been uneven, with mainline denominations, such as Methodists and Presbyterians, shrinking more quickly than evangelical churches.\n\nSlightly fewer than 1 in 6 adult Americans identify with the mainline Protestant churches, according to the survey. Evangelicals, by contrast, make up about one-quarter of the adult U.S. population. They now form a majority among those who identify as Protestant.\n\nAn additional 7 percent of American adults identify with historically black Protestant churches, a share that has remained relatively stable.\n\nCatholics, about 1 in 5 Americans, have also seen some decline in numbers since 2007, the study found, although some other studies have found a more recent uptick. Almost 13 percent of American adults are former Catholics - the largest single group of people who have left a faith in which they were raised.\n\nAmong non-Christian faiths, Judaism remains the largest in the U.S., although only about 2 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Jewish. The number is up very slightly from what the survey found in 2007.\n\nIslam, Hinduism and Buddhism each have less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, although the Muslim and Hindu population have both grown rapidly, reflecting emigration from Asia. Among immigrants who have arrived in the U.S. since 1990, almost 1 in 6 identify with a non-Christian faith.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Under mounting pressure from new revelations that the United States collected the telephone data of tens of millions of Europeans, the Obama administration on Monday said that there is a need for new constraints on U.S. intelligence-gathering operations and a top senator announced that the spying on U.S. allies would stop.\n\nIn an interview aired late Monday by a new cable television outlet, Fusion, President Barack Obama declined to discuss the communications monitoring operations of the National Security Agency, including whether the NSA tapped the telephones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other world leaders.\n\nThe storm battering Obama over the revelations of U.S. data-gathering and communications monitoring in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Brazil showed no sign of abating. Outlined in top-secret documents leaked to news media by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the disclosures are bruising ties with some of the closest U.S. allies, adding to the domestic outcry over the NSA's collection of data from millions of Americans' communications as part of an effort to unearth terrorist plots.\n\n\"Obama must feel very uneasy and embarrassed right now,\" said Hans Christian Stroebel, the longest serving member of the German Parliament's intelligence committee.\n\nAdministration officials, however, continued fending off questions about details of the operations, including when they began and _ in the case of the tapping of the phones of Merkel and the other world leaders _ how high up the command chain they were authorized.\n\nThere were complaints that the administration has been keeping the U.S. intelligence community's congressional overseers in the dark as well. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, announced that the panel would conduct \"a major review into all intelligence collection programs.\"\n\n\"It is my understanding that President Obama was not aware Chancellor Merkel's communications were being collected since 2002. That is a big problem,\" she added in a statement. \"The White House has informed me that collection on our allies will not continue, which I support. But as far as I'm concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing.\"\n\n\"It is clear to me that certain surveillance activities have been in effect for more than a decade and that the Senate Intelligence Committee was not satisfactorily informed,\" Feinstein said. \"Therefore our oversight needs to be strengthened and increased.\n\n\"With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies ... let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,\" she said.\n\nThe White House denied that it hasn't discussed the issue with Feinstein.\n\n\"We consult regularly with Chairman Feinstein,\" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. \"I'm not going to go into the details of those private discussions, nor am I going to comment on assertions made in the senator's statement today about U.S. foreign intelligence activities.\"\n\nIn the latest revelations, two Spanish newspapers reported that a document leaked by Snowden showed that the NSA collected data _ locations and phone numbers _ but not the content of 60 million telephone calls made in Spain between December 2012 and early January.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costas was summoned by Spanish officials to discuss the revelations. He later issued a statement in which he acknowledged, \"Ultimately, the United States needs to balance the important role that these programs play in protecting our national security and protecting the security of our allies with legitimate privacy concerns.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney sounded a similar theme, telling reporters that a review of U.S. intelligence-gathering operations that Obama ordered this summer is aimed at ensuring that \"we are properly accounting for both the security of our citizens and our allies and the privacy concerns shared by Americans and citizens around the world.\"\n\nWith new technology available for intelligence-gathering, he said, the administration recognizes that \"there needs to be additional constraints on how we gather and use intelligence.\"\n\n\"Just because we've made these extraordinary technological advances that give us greater capacities, we need to make sure that we're collecting intelligence in a way that advances our security needs and that we don't just do it because we can,\" he said.\n\nThe review \"will look at, among other issues, some of the very specific things with regards to intelligence-gathering, including matters that deal with heads of state and other governments,\" Carney said. \"When it comes to the relationship that we have with various allies, this is obviously something that has been of concern, and we are working to address those concerns diplomatically.\"\n\nHe noted that a European parliamentary delegation now visiting Washington would be discussing the issue with officials from the U.S. intelligence community and the departments of State, Commerce, Treasury and Homeland Security.\n\nThe delegation is looking to secure strong protections for communications data as part of a landmark U.S.-European Union trade deal now being negotiated. Its leader, Elmar Brok, a member of Merkel's party, said that a failure to secure those protections could threaten the talks.\n\n\"We are fighting for the rights of our citizens,\" Brok, the chairman of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill, where the delegation discussed the NSA scandal with lawmakers.\n\nAt the State Department, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the administration wasn't oblivious to the \"challenges\" the disclosures have created. U.S. officials, she said, are explaining to angry foreign counterparts the NSA operations and the internal review.\n\nThe diplomatic moves, however, appeared to be doing little to patch up the rifts over the disclosures that have sparked a media outcry in Europe. One meme that went viral on social media was a doctored photo showing Obama peeping through a window at Merkel as she tries to cover herself with a bath towel after a shower.\n\n\"The disclosures seem to be designed tactically to maximize their impact and the resulting awkwardness for the U.S. government,\" said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. U.S. officials \"are going to have to evaluate how important these programs are to near-term national security and, if they're essential, then they need to make that argument to foreign governments: 'It's not voyeurism, it's international security.'\"\n\nThe Spanish newspaper reports followed a revelation by the French newspaper Le Monde that the NSA collected the data of more than 70 million phone calls made in France between December 2012 and January.\n\nIn Italy, digital library host Cryptome reported that the NSA monitored 46 million phone calls in Italy during the same time period.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The beleaguered director of the Secret Service resigned Wednesday after President Barack Obama lost confidence in her ability to lead the troubled agency amid a string of high-profile security lapses.\n\nJulia A. Pierson, the first woman to hold the post, stepped down hours after an Army veteran who is accused of running into the White House with a knife in his pocket on Sept. 19, pleaded not guilty to three criminal charges in federal court. The judge ordered him to undergo a mental evaluation.\n\nPierson, a 30-year Secret Service veteran, was named director only 18 months ago after a prostitution scandal and other problems suggested poor discipline and inadequate oversight in the supposedly elite force responsible for protecting the president, his family and visiting foreign leaders.\n\nFresh security breaches, and Pierson's repeated stumbles during a combative House of Representatives hearing Tuesday, led to growing calls in Congress for her resignation and Obama quickly agreed.\n\n\"Over the last several days, we've seen recent and accumulating reports raising questions about the performance of the agency, and the president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required,\" said Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman.\n\nIn the latest potential threat, officials said, a private security guard armed with a pistol rode in an elevator with the president during a Sept. 16 visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for a briefing on Ebola, surprising Secret Service agents and violating agency rules over who can carry a weapon near him.\n\nThe gun was discovered only after agents complained the guard was acting oddly and had refused their request to stop using a cellphone camera to record the president in the elevator. Officials said they subsequently discovered the guard was a felon, with multiple convictions for assault and battery.\n\nEarnest said the White House did not learn of the 2-week-old incident until \"shortly before\" news organizations reported the details on Tuesday.\n\nJeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, said he had appointed Joseph Clancy, who headed the Secret Service presidential protective unit before retiring in 2011, as acting director.\n\nClancy has worked the last three years as a senior executive for cable giant Comcast Corp.'s internal security division. He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and Villanova University, according to Comcast.\n\nJohnson also said he had ordered his top deputy, Alejandro Mayorkas, to take charge of the internal Secret Service investigation of the Sept. 19 breach and report back by Nov. 1.\n\nAs House Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican from Ohio, and others in Congress called for an independent investigation of the agency, Johnson said he also would convene a panel of outside experts to recommend improvements to White House security and Secret Service operations. Their assessment is due Dec. 15.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will also hold hearings into the Secret Service next month, committee Chairman Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican from Virginia, said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News, Pierson said it was painful to quit while the Secret Service was \"reeling from a significant security breach.\"\n\nShe said leaving was \"the noble thing to do\" and had decided to resign after meeting with Johnson and agreeing \"we were at the point where it was going to be hard for the department and president to have confidence in the Secret Service leadership if I didn't step down.\"\n\nIn addition to protecting the president and vice president, former presidents and major presidential candidates, the Secret Service investigates counterfeiting of U.S. currency and Treasury securities.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats joined Republicans in saying the next director should come from outside the agency's insular culture.\n\n\"The Secret Service needs a seasoned law enforcement professional who is not a product of the Secret Service to bring about needed reforms,\" Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, echoed calls for an independent congressional investigation.\n\n\"There has to be an independent investigation as to what is going on at the Secret Service,\" she said at a news conference. \"The protection of the president has to be precise, it has to be flawless, and there has to be accountability when that is not the case.\"\n\nPierson's departure won't end congressional scrutiny of the agency, several lawmakers said.\n\n\"Problems at the Secret Service predate Ms. Pierson's tenure as director, and her resignation certainly does not resolve them,\" said Representative Darrell Issa, Republican from California, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nPierson had been appointed in the wake of a 2012 scandal in which a dozen agents allegedly hired prostitutes in Colombia while preparing for a presidential trip, a 2011 shooting attack on the White House to which agents failed to respond, and a 2009 incident in which an uninvited couple attended a state dinner at the White House.\n\nThe latest uninvited visitor, Omar Gonzalez, 42, stared straight ahead and said nothing during a hearing Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Washington. He waived his right to a detention hearing, meaning he will remain in custody.\n\nAccording to court papers and Pierson's testimony in Congress, Gonzalez climbed over the north fence of the White House at 7:19 p.m. on Sept. 19, sprinted unimpeded across the lawn and opened a glass door and a wooden door in the North Portico.\n\nHe then allegedly knocked over an agent inside the door and wrestled with guards who chased him into the East Room before he was finally subdued outside the Green Room. Obama had taken off in Marine One, the presidential helicopter, moments earlier.\n\nDuring her grilling on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Pierson struggled to explain why agents failed to stop Gonzalez before he entered the executive mansion, why an alarm was muted and why the agency did not acknowledge for more than a week that he had forced his way deep inside before he was tackled. She also said agents did not install automatic locks on the front door until after the incident.\n\nLawmakers from both parties criticized her and her aides for giving misleading or inaccurate information about the incident. Some accused her of being evasive in her answers, and her support quickly evaporated.\n\nDuring Gonzalez's 30-minute court hearing, Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson ordered him to undergo a mental evaluation to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. She acknowledged that neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers had sought the evaluation.\n\nDavid Bos, the public defender assigned to represent Gonzalez, insisted his client was prepared to proceed.\n\n\"There is no basis to believe Mr. Gonzalez is not competent to stand trial,\" Bos said. \"It's so clear that this is not appropriate.\"\n\nBos vowed to file a motion challenging the judge's order.\n\nAlthough Secret Service officials initially said the intruder was unarmed, he carried a black folding knife with a 3\\xc2\\xbd-inch serrated blade in his pocket, the agency later acknowledged.\n\nInvestigators also found he had hundreds of rounds of ammunition for shotguns, pistols and rifles in his car, which was parked nearby. According to court papers, he does not hold a valid registration certificate for a firearm.\n\nAfter his arrest, Gonzalez told agents that \"he was concerned the atmosphere was collapsed\" and he needed to get the information to Obama, according to a Secret Service affidavit.\n\nGonzalez faces a federal charge of entering a restricted building while carrying a deadly weapon, and District of Columbia charges of carrying a dangerous weapon outside a home or business, and unlawful possession of ammunition. If convicted, he could face 16 years in prison.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Wondering who to thank for the bizarre rules that allow Congress to approve spending, then later slam the door on new borrowing to pay the bills? Thank the Founding Fathers.\n\nArticle 1 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the exclusive powers to legislate and the power of the purse. In fact, Section 8 of the first article deals specifically with paying debts.\n\nBut the Constitution's Article 2 empowers the president to carry out the laws passed by Congress and run the government at the levels authorized and appropriated by Congress.\n\nIn that simple civics lesson is the root of the problem. Congress passes legislation to spend, but it's the president who must ensure those bills get paid. Those two objectives don't neatly line up. President Barack Obama complains that past presidents haven't been subjected to the types of conditions being asked of him in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling, but it just isn't true. To the contrary, there's plenty of precedent.\n\n\"In the past, Congress has responded to make sure that the Treasury can still keep borrowing, but debt and budgets have always been contentious,\" said D. Andrew Austin, an analyst in government finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the author of a brief but thorough history of the debt limit.\n\nHis research shows that fights over installing a new cap on the nation's debt are hardly a new phenomenon.\n\n\"While the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations, it has at times caused great inconvenience and has added uncertainty to Treasury operations,\" Austin wrote.\n\nThe Constitution created the backdrop for fights between Congress and the president over spending and taxes, but the actual statutory limit on just how much debt the federal government can incur began almost 100 years ago, with the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.\n\nBefore then, Congress had from time to time given the Treasury Department authority to issue bonds to raise money for special projects. And Congress had authorized borrowing for specific reasons such as for building the Panama Canal.\n\nThe issuance of long-term Liberty Bonds changed the game. They were authorized so that the federal government could better hold down its borrowing costs as it funded America's entry into World War I. In 1919, the debt ceiling was about $43 billion, but at the close of the fiscal year debt actually stood at about $25.5 billion, with Congress reluctant to borrow all that was authorized.\n\nSeveral decades of congressionally mandated debt limits followed, and it gave Treasury officials more autonomy to issue debt. Austin's report notes that at the start of World War II, the U.S. debt ceiling of $45 billion was just 10 percent higher than the $40.4 billion in actual debt. Actual borrowing matched up more neatly with authorized amounts. Until the cost of World War II exploded, that is. By 1945, the debt ceiling was set at $300 billion.\n\nThe debt ceiling actually fell, to $270 billion, after the war and stayed there until about 1954. The Korean War was paid for through higher taxes, not more debt. And between 1954 and 1962, the debt limit fell twice and increased seven times. It didn't return to the World War II high-water mark again until March 1962.\n\nFrom that point forward, there were 69 changes to the debt limit through the end of the 2007-2008 fiscal year, including the largest single-chunk increase, $984 billion in May 2003, as America borrowed to pay for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq while also cutting taxes.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, there was brief respite from the politicization of the U.S. debt ceiling. Lawmakers had grown tired of passing spending increases and then voting against raising the debt ceiling for their profligate spending. It made them appear hypocritical in front of the voters, and that second vote to allow more borrowing never played well back home.\n\nIn 1979, up-and-coming Missouri Democrat Dick Gephardt, who later became House majority leader, won a parliamentary ruling that allowed any final vote on a budget to automatically raise the debt ceiling.\n\nThe so-called Gephardt Rule was welcomed by both major political parties because it eliminated the need to take that separate and politically costly vote to raise the debt ceiling. Over time, it lost its luster because senators amended the budget passed by the House, meaning it had to come back to the House for another vote, which had the same effect as voting to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Gephardt Rule, however, ended when Republicans took back the House of Representatives in the 104th Congress and in 1995 Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich became House speaker. He saw an opportunity to use the debt ceiling for political leverage\n\n\"It was looked at by conservatives as another opportunity to take a whack at the fiscal situation ... since the Senate was historically amending the debt limit,\" said William Hoagland, a former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nSince the demise of the Gephardt Rule, whichever political party controlled the Congress has generally used the debt ceiling as a political tool, returning to the 1970s practice of increasing spending but also voting against raising the debt ceiling.\n\nIn one example, Sen. Barack Obama took to the Senate floor on March 16, 2006, in opposition to raising the debt ceiling while George W. Bush was president.\n\n\"Increasing America's debt weakens us,\" Obama argued then.\n\nThat month, China held $635.4 billion in U.S. government debt. By this July, that number had doubled to nearly $1.28 trillion.\n\nSome experts actually see value in the frequent fights over raising the debt ceiling, because they force the two major parties to bridge divides.\n\n\"In fact, debt limit increase bills have served not only as vehicles for bipartisan fiscal reform measures, but catalysts for subsequent negotiations about debt reduction,\" wrote Anita Krishnakumar in the 2005 edition of the Harvard Journal of Legislation.\n\n\"Upon careful evaluation, it is clear that the statute retains enduring value.\"'"

            "text": "\tEver notice how robust and chipper former Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain are compared with a graying President Barack Obama these days?\n\nIf candidates for the highest political office in the land only knew the results of new research, they might be happier about losing an election. The findings might even whittle the outsize pool of Republicans vying for the job.\n\nA study conducted with nearly three centuries of data (but also with tongue planted firmly in cheek) has found that after an election for parliamentary leadership or the presidency, losers lived four more years than did the winners who went on to serve as heads of state.\n\nAfter accounting for the fact that winners were on average a bit older than losers, the study found that politicians who bore the yoke of power lived 2.7 fewer years than did hopefuls who failed to get the people's nod.\n\nThe authors' diagnosis: Despite the thrill of electoral victory, getting elected to a country's highest office \"may lead to accelerated aging due to stress of leadership and political life.\"\n\nThat claim has been controversial. Dr. Michael Roizen, a preventive medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, has asserted that the typical president ages two years for every year he is in office (no data are available - yet - on how a woman would age in office). To draw this conclusion, Roizen has used presidential medical records from the 1920s through today.\n\nBut in the journal JAMA in 2011, human longevity expert S. Jay Olshansky came to the opposite conclusion, drawing on the health and life spans of presidents from George Washington to the present. Olshanksy, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois, found that 23 of 34 presidents who died of natural causes \"lived beyond the average life expectancy for men of the same age when they were inaugurated, even if they hypothetically aged at twice the normal rate while in office.\"\n\nThe new study appears in the BMJ's Christmas issue, which once a year treats readers to a collection of papers that feature silly subjects plumbed with high rigor and serious subjects explored with fanciful methods. Last year, a widely cited paper conducted a rigorous test of \"male idiot theory\" and concluded that, indeed, men are idiots.\n\nThe latest research adds to a surprisingly robust line of research: whether winning accolades, honors and elections actually confers longevity. Past work in this field has found that Academy Award winners, those who win Emmy Awards and Nobel Prize laureates tend to live longer than do nominees who did not win.\n\nInductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame, one 2013 paper found, did not fare so well. Those granted baseball's highest honor died on average two years younger than did their peers who were nominated but not inducted. (This finding might come as timely comfort to Clemson's Deshaun Watson and Stanford's Christian McCaffrey, finalists for the Heisman Trophy who this weekend lost in a squeaker to University of Alabama running back Derrick Henry.)\n\nAlas, research has not yielded a clear pattern when the longevity of senior political winners and losers was compared. The current study sought to surmount the methodological shortcomings that plagued those earlier efforts. To do so, it drew on close to three centuries of electoral results in Austria, Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United States.\n\nThe researchers' earliest example drew from the 1722 parliamentary election in Britain.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama isn't expected to get the federal minimum-wage increase he's wanted anytime soon, but advocates hope that public support for the issue gets a boost from an unusual set of states this Election Day.\n\nAlaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota - four solid-red states whose voters often oppose the president's agenda - might be next to raise the wage floor of America's lowest-paid hourly workers. On Nov. 4, they will vote on ballot measures to increase their minimum wages.\n\nSome advocates hope that victories on the ballot, especially in four Republican strongholds, will change the national narrative of the economic debate.\n\n\"It becomes a lot harder for members of Congress who might not support these kinds of things to continually say 'no' when it comes up in Washington,\" said Josh Levin, a vice president at the left-leaning Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which supports activists on state ballot measures.\n\nStates have already been busy on the minimum wage this year. Ten state legislatures and the District of Columbia have raised their minimum wages in 2014, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nHowever, the legislation mostly passed in blue states such as Vermont, Massachusetts and Hawaii. Only one of those 10 states, West Virginia, voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nThe issue has gained a lot of attention this year.\n\nEarlier this month, fast-food workers across the country participated in a strike in favor of a $15-per-hour \"livable\" wage, more than double the current federal floor of $7.25. The Seattle City Council passed a $15 hourly rate in June, and some activists are pushing that figure elsewhere in Washington state.\n\nThe ballot measures in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota would bring about much smaller increases. But that doesn't bother Steve Copley, chairman of the Give Arkansas a Raise Now coalition.\n\n\"Every penny that somebody who is working hard can get helps,\" Copley said.\n\nActivists must be realistic about what increases they push for at the polls, said Peggy Shorey, the director of state government relations at the AFL-CIO, whose state federations support the ballot initiatives.\n\n\"Arkansas is not the same as Seattle,\" she said.\n\nThe current $6.25-per-hour state minimum wage makes Arkansas one of three states lower than the federal floor for hourly wages. Only Georgia and Wyoming are lower, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. When state minimum wages differ from the federal rate, the higher rate is adhered to in that particular state, as employers don't want to violate federal law.\n\nLast year, about 91,000 workers earned the federal minimum wage or below - employees who earn tips, for example - in the four states with November ballot proposals, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, thousands more would be affected as the state wage floors rose gradually.\n\nWhile all four initiatives would begin wage increases Jan. 1, the approaches are split on their long-term considerations of how to link the minimum wage to cost-of-living increases.\n\nUnder Alaska's ballot proposal, the minimum wage would be tied to increases in the Anchorage Consumer Price Index caused by inflation starting in 2017. South Dakota's initiative would raise the minimum wage based on changes to a national CPI metric starting in 2016.\n\nTying annual increases to CPI fluctuations is controversial. Opponents in South Dakota say it's one of their biggest concerns of the ballot proposal there.\n\n\"The economies in Florida, California and New Jersey are going to dictate how employers in our state are going to have to do (wage) increases every year,\" said Shawn Lyons, the executive director of the South Dakota Retailers Association, a wage-hike opponent.\n\nTen states, including Florida and Washington, have minimum wages legally tied to CPI metrics, according to the Department of Labor. New Jersey will join them in January, with the District of Columbia, Minnesota and Michigan scheduled to follow suit in upcoming years.\n\nCopley said such a measure in Arkansas would have been a non-starter at the polls. \"We didn't feel like we could get it passed,\" he said.\n\nInstead, the minimum hourly rates would top off at $8.50 per hour in 2017 in Arkansas and $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska under their ballot proposals.\n\nIllinois, considered a left-leaning state, is holding a vote in November on raising its $8.25 minimum hourly wage to $10, but the advisory referendum is nonbinding and doesn't carry the weight of law.\n\nRepublican state Senator Kyle McCarter sees that as election-year political maneuvering.\n\n\"The Dems are loading the ballot with referendums that mean nothing, just so they can get their traditional supporters out to the polls to vote for them,\" he told the Belleville News-Democrat in May.\n\nThe executive director of the South Dakota Democratic Party, Zach Crago, said that was partially the point. He said the proposal to raise South Dakota's minimum wage made for good midterm politics.\n\n\"It creates contrasts, which are good in elections,\" Crago said. \"It also motivates voters. Raising the minimum wage is a pocketbook issue, when people can clearly tie their vote to their way of life.\"\n\nFormer Alaska labor commissioner Ed Flanagan, who's a wage-hike advocate, said the Alaskan campaign had benefited from a grass-roots union presence. At 23.1 percent of the state's wage and salary workers, Alaska's union membership rate is more than double the national rate, according to BLS data.\n\nSome minimum-wage-hike opponents think the getting-out-the-vote effect of the ballot proposals is a one-way street. Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom President Doug Kagan said the minimum-wage ballot proposal was unlikely to excite voters on his side of the debate.\n\n\"The minimum wage issue is more important to the Democratic voters than to the Republican voters\" in Nebraska, said Kagan, whose conservative group opposes raising the state minimum wage.\n\nIt might be an uphill battle for wage-increase opponents before voters head to the polls.\n\n\"Our polls would indicate we have a lot of work to do to educate people on some of our concerns,\" said Michael Held, a lobbyist with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, which opposes that state's proposal.\n\nIn August, 58 percent of surveyed potential Alaskan voters supported the state initiative there, according to Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm.\n\nA poll by the Arkansas publication Talk Business and Hendrix College found in April that 79 percent of surveyed Arkansas voters supported their state's ballot initiative.\n\nThe Arkansas campaign doesn't need a strong state labor presence to be successful, said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College who helped craft and analyze the April poll.\n\n\"Arkansas has more of a populist tradition than some of the other Southern states that are more conservative on economic issues,\" Barth said.\n\nFive Southern states - South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama - have no state minimum wage at all, deferring to the federal rate.\n\nShorey, with the AFL-CIO, said she thought successful ballot measures in November could help families and change the national discussion on the minimum wage debate.\n\n\"Red states passing it reinforces this doesn't have to be a totally partisan issue,\" she said.'"

            "title": "For a failed bronco, a new rider offers a shot at rodeo redemption",
            "text": "\tPRESCOTT, Ariz. - The horse trotted gingerly out of his silver steel trailer, each step coughing up a puff of dry field dirt. He is 15 hands high with a fine, sinewy frame and a bluish stripe down his nose. He is the beautiful sorrel that just couldn't win.\n\nIn the steamy twilight at the oldest professional rodeo in the nation, the shy horse found himself near the end of his line - not good for work, not fearless enough for the arena.\n\nHis last, best chance coaxed him out of the trailer one hour before showtime, a champion calf roper all of 25 years old who looks even younger, with a mop of downy brown hair and a face absent any sarcasm or mirth.\n\nHis name is Bryce Runyan. He does not curse. Calls everyone \"sir\" or \"ma'am.\" If there's brown liquid in his cup, it is iced tea.\n\nRunyan swept a comb through the auburn locks of his new partner, who spent most of his life in rodeo as a failed bronco named Bruce.\n\nPerhaps \"failed\" is too strong a word. But what else to call a horse that was handed over nearly free to a young man from Silver City, New Mexico?\n\nOther cowboys \"said he couldn't run how they wanted,\" Runyan said. \"I saw he could run the way I wanted.\"\n\nBruce wasn't bold or violent enough for bronco riding, the iconic rodeo event where cowboys try to stay astride a bucking horse.\n\nBut Bruce was quick and strong, and he had something those wild-eyed broncos didn't: He was smart, and in calf roping, a smart horse can win.\n\nWho can say why a team works? It's not simply a measure of paying for the most talent. Good teammates share some indefinable connection, when magic occurs and the partnership is greater than the sum of its parts. On this June evening in Prescott, Runyan and Bruce would begin to find out if they had it.\n\nRunyan swung a leg over Bruce's back and they trotted to the rodeo grounds. The sun was setting and girls on horseback in sequined shawls and cowboy hats raced around the arena's perimeter, waving American flags at a rodeo that dates to 1888.\n\nA clown-car ambulance emerged, its engine smoking. \"I couldn't afford to change the oil with that Obamacare,\" the rodeo clown said into the microphone to riotous applause.\n\nObamacare jokes kill here.\n\nThere's a moment in nearly every rodeo that reveals the first-timers in the crowd. Veteran hands know the moment, relish it, and it comes during calf roping.\n\nA calf sprints into the arena and the newcomers coo and aww. An eye blink later, a mounted cowboy makes a break for the calf, slings his lasso and the calf stops short, the rope around its neck.\n\nIf the stop is violent enough, the uninitiated in the crowd will gasp. If they don't, they will when they see what happens next as the cowboy leaps from his saddle, runs to the calf, lifts it and slams it to the ground, its little legs wiggling in the air. The cowboy then binds three of its legs together with a strip of \"piggin' string.\" All in seconds.\n\nIt takes practice, hours and hours in a dirt patch somewhere, working on their timing and movement, trying and failing and trying and failing until finally horse and rider move as one. It was like that for Runyan and Bruce's predecessor, a friendly chestnut named Maverick.\n\nThe horse was good, sometimes great, capping his career with a memorable performance in last year's Prescott rodeo, when Maverick and Runyan won first place and $5,000.\n\nBut Maverick was getting older. He is 13, and worse, he and Runyan had grown too used to each other. This sometimes happens to rodeo horses - they know their riders so well, they over-anticipate the next move, fouling the milliseconds that define who wins and who loses.\n\nSo Runyan tried to break in new horses to replace him. There was Katie, who was too slow, and Rob, who just didn't get it. Then he found Bruce. A sweet horse, said the family who owned him, but no champion.\n\nThey weren't ready to sell the horse, but did not want to give him away either, so they offered Runyan a kind of lifetime lease: For a $1,000 down payment, take Bruce and train him, they said, and keep the winnings.\n\nThe traits of a calf-roping horse are specific. The horse must have a terrifically quick launch from the gate, timed to the moment the rider tenses his legs. The horse must be able to stop and drop down his rear end immediately to speed the rider's dismount.\n\nBut all of that is easy compared with what comes next. No other sport, anywhere, asks its competitors to leave their conveyances: A NASCAR driver doesn't hop out of her Chevy SS. When a calf roper leaps off his horse, he's trusting not just training, but intuition - trusting that the horse understands what's happening and will react appropriately.\n\nIf the horse pulls away too quickly, the calf gets dragged. If he draws closer and lets the rope loosen, a rider is dealing with a few dozen pounds of unrestrained, ticked-off bovine.\n\nA calf roper and his horse must wait to enter the ring behind a wooden barrier. After the calf runs a certain distance, the barrier falls and the rider begins the chase. Sometimes a rider gets too eager and crashes through the barrier, suffering a 10-second penalty.\n\nTenths of seconds matter: Runyan won last year by roping his first calf in 10 seconds flat. His next-closest competition came in at 10.70.\n\nRunyan sat astride Bruce, chewing the piggin' string and making long, slow loops with his lasso.\n\nThe public address system crackled to life: \"Here is your champion from last year, Brrrrrryce Runyan!\"\n\nRunyan tipped back his straw hat and held Bruce's reins taut. As the crowd went quiet, Runyan's eyes trained forward.\n\nCLANG! The calf spilled out of the gate, loping left, then veering to the center, slackening the line. Runyan couldn't adjust. He and Bruce blew through the barrier and the crowd groaned.\n\nThat was it. A half-second and the show, for Runyan, was over.\n\n\"Don't let him go out like that,\" the announcer implored.\n\nThe crowd murmured and rustled and eventually mustered respectable applause.\n\nRunyan, his head bowed and hair slick with sweat, lifted his head, pulled up his hat and nodded, then rode Bruce through a cluster of horse trailers.\n\nRunyan thinks of growing up and leaving rodeo some day. He envisions marrying his girlfriend and ending a life that has kept him on the road for most of his 20s.\n\nOff last year's $5,000 from the Prescott rodeo and a few wins in amateur races, Runyan was about breaking even on the rodeo circuit.\n\n\"It could be a couple dollars either way,\" he said, grinning, \"but no one's getting rich.\"\n\nHe has a future already set in construction. It's his father's business, and building work is steady in the Southwest.\n\nBut for now he wants to keep riding.\n\nThe cowboy has set his sights on the next rodeo a few days later, in Taylor, a town of about 4,000 in east-central Arizona with no postal delivery. Runyan has to win in Taylor, or his chances of making the National Finals Rodeo would be dim.\n\nHe arrived in Taylor after a four-hour drive mostly through forest, and on competition night readied his horse as a wriggly black calf pressed against the chute. A cowboy nudged it forward until CLANG!, the calf sprinted out, sand coating its legs and hooves.\n\nRunyan clipped his legs together and Bruce exploded forward, gaining on the calf in 3.2 seconds. Runyan swooped the lasso around the calf's neck.\n\nThe shudder from the rope tensing was all Bruce needed: He knew to squat down, and Runyan slid off his right flank.\n\nBruce reared for a moment but held the line taut. Runyan slammed the calf to the ground and whipped the piggin' string around its two forelegs and its right rear leg.\n\nHe stared up at the scoreboard, bewildered: 9.7 seconds. His fastest time ever, even better than with Maverick.\n\n\"Well, folks!\" the announcer said. \"How about that!\"\n\nBruce fluttered his lips; Runyan didn't even crack a grin. A graying cowboy who had been otherwise motionless waved him over, spoke for two seconds and resumed his stony silence.\n\n\"He said, 'Good ride,'\" Runyan said.\n\nThis is the way it is in rodeos. There is no showy victory lap. Just a handshake and a check, this one for $2,000.\n\nBut Runyan came away with something even more valuable. The cowboy now knows he had been right all along: Bruce wasn't a failure. He, like Runyan, only needed the right partner.'"

            "title": "Stem cells still uncharted territory in sports ",
            "text": "\tC.J. Nitkowski had nothing to lose in spring 2011. The rotator cuff in his left shoulder that he'd relied on during his decade as a major league pitcher was in tatters. He was 38 and his fastball traveled a Little League-worthy 50 mph.\n\nSurgery and the ensuing lengthy rehab would have killed his career. So Nitkowski paid $3,000 to have stem cells extracted from his waist, separated then injected back into his shoulder.\n\n\"I look at it as a last shot,\" Nitkowski said.\n\nThe ensuing \"boost\" he felt helped him sign a minor-league deal with the New York Mets in 2012. Though he never made it back to the majors before retiring in 2013, Nitkowski is confident he'd wrung out every last ounce of talent. While not an advocate for stem cell therapy, as one of the few athletes who have gone public on the treatment he understands why active players approach him about it.\n\n\"I can't give a recommendation,\" Nitkowski said. \"I can only tell my story. I feel like, based on what I believe, that (stem cell therapy) would almost become like maintenance ... if they generate tissue.\"\n\nThat \"if\" remains problematic for professional athletes and teams that pay them millions. Several years after Nitkowski's procedure, debate on stem cell therapy for helping rehab injuries is no closer to resolution.\n\nBlame it on a lack of study and still-evolving knowledge about what stem cells can and can't do. Blame hype that typically accompanies every new method that attempts to quicken recovery from serious injury.\n\nPlayers and agents are paying attention.\n\n\"They want the cutting edge, anything that is cutting edge that can get their guys a couple more years in the league,\" said Dr. Jim Bradley, orthopedic surgeon for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. \"If I was an agent, I'd want the same thing.\"\n\nYet while Bradley is bullish on its potential, he spends a fair amount of time explaining what exactly stem cell therapy does, ostensibly. Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue. The belief is that stem cells can serve as reinforcements to an injured muscle or joint.\n\nBut nearly all evidence is anecdotal - no definitive lab results show it works. That has done little to dampen interest.\n\n\"Everybody wants answers right now and you can't have them right now,\" Bradley said.\n\nAt least not in the United States, where medical regulation is more restrictive than elsewhere. To avoid scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, stem cell doctors generally perform same-day procedures similar to what Nitkowski received. That's not the case overseas.\n\nClinics in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer far more aggressive therapies. Patients can have stem cells taken out then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.\n\nBradley believes those countries are 10 years ahead of the United States on stem cell therapy. He has referred some patients (not Steelers, following team policy) to a practice in the Cayman Islands he considers safe.\n\nAthletes who go outside the U.S. generally do so quietly. News reports said Peyton Manning traveled to Germany in 2011 while recovering from neck surgery, but Manning hasn't spoken publicly about the issue. Tennis star Rafael Nadal had stem cell treatment in 2014 to help his ailing back but hasn't endorsed the procedure.\n\nPro teams in the United States can't prohibit players dealing with injuries from seeking as many opinions as they want. But teams don't automatically endorse treatments.\n\n\"If the player does something we're not recommending, it's more or less on them,\" Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said. \"We firmly recommend that you stay here.\"\n\nThe doctor who treated Nitkowski, Dr. Joseph Purita, gave stem cell therapy to pitcher Bartolo Colon in the Dominican Republic in 2010. Colon later tested positive for testosterone and was suspended 50 games. Purita denied giving Colon any performance-enhancing drugs but the circumstances only discouraged teams.\n\n\"Traveling to a place like the Caymans, that's like saying 'I'm going to Mexico to have an appendectomy to save $80,'\" said Dr. Matthew Matava, head physician for the NFL's St. Louis Rams and the NHL's St. Louis Blues. \"It looks like it's not very smart or you're grasping at straws.\"\n\nIn some ways, research on stem cells remains in the embryonic stages.\n\n\"There is so much hype, so much marketing,\" said Matava, president of the NFL's Physician Society. \"The market kind of outpaces the research and the validation.\"\n\nDr. Freddie Fu, head physician for University of Pittsburgh athletics, takes his skepticism farther. Fu's had stem cells in his lab for 15 years but refuses to use them on humans because of uncertainty, including unpredictability of what manipulated cells will do once introduced to a new area.\n\n\"You can have one cell be Obi Wan Kenobi, the other is Darth Vader,\" Fu said. \"You're not sure which way it's going to go.\"\n\nFu is all for progress. Yet for all of sports medicine's advances over the last half-century, some laws of nature remain intractable.\n\n\"If you get hurt, it's going to take time to heal,\" Fu said. \"It's a part of life. There's always a way to think that maybe something is better, but it might not be.\"'"

            "text": "\tBehind the heavy brown door that opens into the Maryland Table Tennis Center, balls ping, zing, pop and pong, hair flies, sneakers squeak and laughter echoes off the walls. Oblivious to the noise, Crystal Wang, 13, finishes her homework in a corner, and then heads over to a blue table. She picks up a rubber-coated paddle, bends her knees, leans into her toes and looks into her opponent's eyes. She shifts her weight, pulls back her arm and delivers a serve with a feather-light touch.\n\nIn a flash, 14-year-old Derek Nie responds from the other side of the net, returning the spinning ball.\n\nCrystal and Derek are no casual players. They are two of the most promising American teenagers in competitive table tennis.\n\nThe sport, also known as Ping-Pong, is like tennis, but it's played indoors on a table divided by a short net. Playing involves a lot of small moves and heart-pounding footwork.\n\n\"It feels like a rush,\" Derek says.\n\nCrystal, from Boyds, and Derek, from Potomac, Maryland, train at the Gaithersburg, Maryland, center almost every day. Derek started playing at age 7, after his older brother got into the sport. Crystal's grandparents, both of whom played table tennis, introduced her to it at age 5.\n\n\"It's amazing how Crystal and Derek show up at the club ready to play, day after day, week after week, never moping around or complaining and always striving to get better,\" coach Larry Hodges says. \"They are both also great students. Somehow they balance it all.\"\n\nDerek juggles the demands of eighth grade at Robert Frost Middle School (Rockville, Maryland), his math team and practicing violin. Crystal, who Hodges says is one of the best female table tennis players of her age in U.S. history, practices every day and still manages to excel in the magnet program at Roberto Clemente Middle School (Germantown, Maryland). She competes all over the world, in such places as Japan, Canada, India, China and Austria. Every summer, she travels to China to train.\n\nIn 2014, Crystal became the youngest person ever to make the USA National Women's Team and the youngest to win the under-22 women's singles competition at the USA National Table Tennis Championships held in December in Las Vegas.\n\nLast year, Derek won his age group at the U.S. Open in Las Vegas. He competes in tournaments around the United States. These days, both players are preparing to compete in the Olympic trials next year.\n\n\"My dream is to make the Olympic team,\" says Crystal, who also hopes that table tennis will help her get into a good college. She plans to study medicine.\n\nTheir successes have been mixed with challenges. In March, Crystal had a big loss. \"I was too nervous in my mental game,\" she says. \"I did really bad, but I just tried to learn from the experience.\"\n\nBut the challenges provide opportunities to improve in ways outside of their sport. Like how Derek no longer feels that nervous doing oral presentations for his English class. \"At least,\" he says, \"I'm less nervous compared to how I feel at a big tournament.\"\n\nAnd they do have fun along the way. Crystal says she loves making new friends at tournaments. \"And,\" Derek adds with a laugh, \"she really likes to win.\"'"

            "text": "\tSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. - At St. Paul's Episcopal School in Mobile, Alabama, the high school that produced Crimson Tide quarterbacks AJ McCarron and Jake Coker, there's a new preseason ritual for football players: the social media talk.\n\nIt's about more than minding their manners. Coach Steve Mask warns players not to post about injuries, which can scare away recruiters. Committing on Twitter to a school is also discouraged - one recent former player tweeted commitments to four different schools without informing any coaches.\n\n\"He came across as being not reliable,\" Mask said. \"He gets a little joy out of the attention, but it's not worth it.\"\n\nThis season, Mask is taking his players' online personas so seriously that he's assigning an assistant to monitor their accounts. As college programs increasingly use Twitter, Instagram and other social media accounts to evaluate a player's character, one wrong comment can cost a scholarship offer.\n\nThat was the case recently at Penn State for offensive line coach Herb Hand, who took to Twitter recently to vent his frustration with a recruit gone bad online.\n\n\"Dropped another prospect this AM due to his social media presence ... Actually glad I got to see the 'real' person before we offered him,\" Hand tweeted.\n\nAt Penn State media day last week, Hand said his wife scolded him for the tone of the tweet. Cruel, maybe, but fair.\n\n\"You want to recruit guys with strong character,\" he said. \"Somebody messaged me, 'Sometimes kids are worried more about being a character than having character.'\"\n\nYes, teens do tweet the darndest things, but Hand and other coaches say it's usually fairly easy to differentiate between a cringe-inducing post and one that raises a serious red flag on a prospect.\n\n\"There's a difference though when you're talking about information that may be degrading to women, referencing drug use, and anything that has to do with cyberbullying and stuff like that. There's certain things you don't want to be part of your program,\" Hand said.\n\nHand, who is one of the most active and engaging college coaches you'll find on Twitter, is not alone in cutting off a recruit because of the player's use of social media.\n\n\"It's happened this year and this recruiting class,\" Duke coach David Cutcliffe said. \"It's just insane what some of them think's OK. When I know it's them and I read it and I see some of the things out there, if I'm on the road, I'll call a coach - let his high school coach know we're no longer interested. And I'll call back to (Duke director of football relations) Kent McLoud or the people in the office and say I want him dropped off the database. No more mail. Nothing.\"\n\nNCAA rules regarding contact between recruits and football coaches have become more restrictive in recent years. Coaches can't text recruits and opportunities to meet face to face have decreased. Social media have become more ubiquitous, and that helps coaches fill the information gap in recruiting.\n\nArkansas coach Bret Bielema said social media are now part of his standard checklist for recruits.\n\n\"He's got to have a GPA that I can relate to, an ACT or SAT score or a pre-ACT score, and the third box is for social media,\" Bielema said.\n\n\"I distinctly remember a player last year who signed, was a big-time kid, had an interest in us, and his Twitter handle was something that I can't repeat in here. I just kind of said, what are we doing here? This is about as obvious as it gets about what kind of thing we're dealing with here, so we backed out altogether,\" he said.\n\nHand said he tries to educate high school coaches who might be behind the curve in online communication. And he often tries to educate players he's recruiting about how to avoid social media missteps.\n\n\"If you talk to a guy and he doesn't adjust things, that's another red flag for you,\" he said. \"If they're not going to take coaching on this, what are they going to do on third-and-short when you need them to make a block and they kind of do their own deal?\"\n\nBruce Rollinson, who is starting his 26th season as coach of Southern California powerhouse Mater Dei High School, said he added the social media talk to his routine about three years ago, borrowing some of the dos and don'ts USC gives its athletes.\n\n\"Don't harass anybody,\" Rollinson said, focusing mostly on the don'ts. \"Don't bring up race, religion, sexual orientation and physical conditions.\"\n\nSouth Carolina freshman defensive back Chris Lammons said he got the message in high school and cleaned up his Twitter act, despite what his friends were doing.\n\n\"In the transition from being a little kid to a man, that's the thing you have to do, because when you're growing up, you probably want to get a big time job somewhere and they look back at your Twitter account and they see the things you're putting out,\" Lammons said.'"

            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - Sakora Miller remembers being puzzled when a group of strangers visited her gym class in tough west Philadelphia and offered to teach them a sport.\n\nEveryone already knew how to play basketball, the most popular game in the neighborhood, she recalled thinking. What else is there?\n\n\"They were like, (it's) squash,\" she said. \"And I was like, I'm not learning that. It's not for me.\"\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the squash court: Miller turned out to be pretty good at it. Now, she's just become the first alum hired full-time at SquashSmarts, the after-school program she joined as a seventh-grader in 2004.\n\nInner cities are not typical havens for squash, which is similar to racquetball but often considered a niche sport for the elite. Yet SquashSmarts is among 15 clubs nationwide using the game to help underprivileged students through exercise and academic support.\n\nInterest is growing: Supporters hope to start four more programs this year. The existing clubs collectively serve about 1,400 urban students - a small segment of the school population, but one that's exposed to intensive mentoring, travel opportunities and community service.\n\n\"The philosophy is inch-wide, mile-deep,\" said Tim Wyant, executive director of the New York-based National Urban Squash and Education Association.\n\nThe popularity of squash has jumped dramatically in the U.S., from about 600,000 players in 2007 to nearly 1.3 million in 2012, according to a survey by the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association.\n\nInternationally, it's seen as an accessible game played by millions of people in about 185 countries. But the sport evolved differently here, engaging mostly affluent enthusiasts in private athletic clubs and schools.\n\nToday, many squash lovers \"enjoy seeing the demographics of the game change,\" Wyant said.\n\nA former squash pro started the first urban program in Boston in 1995 by combining fitness with tutoring to keep at-risk students from dropping out. Over the next 10 years, the idea spread to Philadelphia and both the Bronx and Harlem neighborhoods of New York.\n\nProgram growth was aided by a serendipitous move to adopt global squash standards in the U.S., which meant building larger courts. That left a lot of unused smaller courts at many universities, said Kevin Klipstein, president of U.S. Squash, the game's governing body.\n\n\"Had that conversion not occurred, it may have been harder to get access to these facilities,\" Klipstein said.\n\nIn 2005, the inner-city groups formed the umbrella organization overseen by Wyant to organize tournaments and standardize programs. The association, which receives some support from U.S. Squash, later added 11 clubs and now plans to start programs in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Hartford, Conn., and Cartagena, Colombia.\n\nSquashSmarts in Philadelphia serves about 120 students in fifth through 12th grade, furnishing all necessary uniforms, equipment, snacks and academic space. Private donors and foundations provide nearly all of the club's annual $570,000 budget, executive director Stephen Gregg said.\n\nStudents play on courts at Drexel University and at the Lenfest Center, a gleaming recreational building financed by a program benefactor and located in the gritty Hunting Park neighborhood.\n\nSquashSmarts recruits its players from public schools. Participation is encouraged because the cash-strapped district can't afford to offer such nontraditional sports, said Robert Coleman, the executive director of athletics.\n\nAnd while SquashSmarts staffers often get the same quizzical reaction that Sakora Miller had, they still gain new converts.\n\nJoshua Smith, 13, was one of the skeptics when recruiters visited his middle school last year. His first thought: \"What is squash? That's stupid.\"\n\n\"And then I tried it,\" the eighth-grader said, \"and I love it now.\"\n\nSquashSmarts tracks participants' cardiovascular fitness, grade-point averages and college placements. In a district with a high dropout rate, all those who stayed in the club for seven years have graduated on time and been accepted to college, Gregg said.\n\nBeing able to hire Miller as squash director brings the program full circle, he said. She's now 23 and finishing an online degree from Penn State.\n\n\"When the students of SquashSmarts grow up to become the academic directors, the squash directors, the executive directors of this program,\" said Gregg, \"that, to me, is change in a community.\"'"

            "text": "\tACACIAS, Colombia - The man with the crash helmet and the American-flag shirt barrels down the muddy track on a muscled steed, chasing a bull the size of small car. Slipping in behind the galloping beast, he snatches its tail, wraps it around his fist and leans far off his saddle. The bull tumbles and rolls - spraying the cheering crowd with mud - before bouncing up and lumbering down the track.\n\nWelcome to the world of coleo, a high-speed, high-risk sport that's hard on man, bull and spectators.\n\nIn this part of South America, coleo is a birthright, a practice learned by farmhands who have to chase down runaway cattle.\n\nBut these llanos, or plains, are also the epicenter of coleo sporting culture - drawing competitors from around Latin America and beyond. During a recent event, there were Venezuelans in their tri-color shirts, Mexicans with their chaps and wagon-wheel sombreros and men from South Florida who - in cowboy hats and boots - looked like they had just stepped out of a Marlboro ad.\n\nColeo in the United States has had a rough ride. A decade ago, the Humane Society investigated competitions in South Florida and didn't like what it saw. Bulls were breaking legs and fracturing their tails.\n\nThe American Coleo Federation, which is based in Miami, says it has modified the sport since then - shortening the track and condensing the amount of time a coleador has to flip a bull - to make it safer for athlete and animal alike.\n\nIt has also joined the American Professional Rodeo Association and follows the group's guidelines, said Francisco Palmero, the head of the coleo federation.\n\nIn rodeos, cowboys grab bulls by the head in what's known as bull dogging, he explained. \"We're doing exactly the same thing, but we grab them by the tail,\" he said. And some argue that coleo is safer than calf-roping.\n\nLaura Bevan is the southern region director for the Humane Society of the United States, who investigated the practice, also known as \"bull tailing,\" in Florida in 2003. She said her group has not had any recent complaints, but she is wary of claims that it has been made safer.\n\n\"Anytime you're talking about taking an animal, grabbing its tail and flipping it, the whole process is fraught with danger for that animal,\" she said. \"I don't think there's a way to change it to make it better.\"\n\nIn Colombia, however, danger is part of the show. While many riders wear helmets and face masks, others rush in with nothing but a straw hat. Some of the cattle wranglers go barefoot.\n\nOver the course of a recent two-day event, one rider was thrown and trampled by his horse, spectators were clipped by galloping coleadores, and several bulls had to be hauled off the track by a bulldozer. The announcer called it \"the bull ambulance,\" but it wasn't clear whether the bulls couldn't get up or simply refused to.\n\nThe World Society for the Protection of Animals, which is active in Colombia trying to stamp out bullfighting and urban workhorses, said coleo isn't on its radar.\n\nJorge Tapia, 47, is a South Florida real estate investor whose passion is flipping bulls. He is part of a group of about 46 people who practice coleo regularly on a ranch in Hialeah. Tapia and four others - all originally from Venezuela - traveled to this small Colombian town in the hope of bagging some of the $40,000 in prize money.\n\nTapia said the sport is growing in the United States. His group held exhibitions in June and August that attracted about 5,000 spectators in total, he said. And while the group is trying to make it safer for the bulls, it remains dangerous for the horsemen, he said.\n\n\"Could you die out here? Yes, you could die out here,\" he said as he wrapped one hand in white tape. Asked whether he was injured, he shrugged it off. \"I'm not injured, just sore.\"\n\nColeo rules differ from country to country, but in Colombia it works like this: If a rider can roll a bull once, a campana, he gets 20 points; if the bull rolls twice, or a campanilla, it's 30 points. To roll a bull three times, or a remolino, is as rare as a grand slam, and is worth 40 points.\n\nJohn Alejandro Useche, 25, is one of Colombia's top coleadores. Thin and spindly, he somehow manages to force 1,100-pound bulls to flip side-over-side like rolling logs. He claims that only llaneros from Colombia and Venezuela have the ability to make a bull roll three times. But he says Team USA has impressive skills.\n\n\"Their level of competition is very, very high\" he says. \"One of these days, they're going to beat us here in Colombia.\"\n\nDuring a recent event in this small town they came close, taking third prize and winning recognition as the best visiting delegation.\n\nLuis Espinoza, 33, is an avid coleo fan, traveling the country to watch the sport. He said the practices is part of Colombia's culture and tradition, and reflects the region's love of animals - something city folk simply didn't understand.\n\nBefore becoming part of the show, the bulls are well taken care of, he said. Only rarely does a bull get injured, and they all end up at the slaughterhouse anyway. As for the horses, they're groomed and pampered like show ponies, he said.\n\n\"Look at that white horse,\" Espinoza said, nudging a friend. \"It's more beautiful than my girlfriend.\"'"

He will yell a cue, and Olson, a long snapper, will hike the ball back in a tight spiral for an extra-point or field-goal attempt.\n\nThe timing and precision on such a play must be perfect, but if all goes well, the kick will split the uprights.\n\nIf that scenario seems improbable, well, you don't know Jake Olson.\n\n---\n\nOlson was born with retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the retina. He lost his left eye at 10 months and endured numerous procedures designed to save the right eye. He was 12 when doctors determined it would need to be removed.\n\nBy then, he had become an avid USC football fan, and he wanted to watch the Trojans as much as possible before the surgery.\n\nPete Carroll, then coach of the Trojans, heard about Olson and invited him, his twin sister, Emma, and their parents, Cindy and Brian, to meet the team.\n\nWhen Olson arrived at a 2009 USC team meeting, he said hello to quarterback Matt Barkley and other players, then prepared to observe from the back of the room.\n\nCarroll introduced Olson, and the players loudly chanted his name. The coach motioned him forward. Center Kristofer O'Dowd, Olson's favorite player, escorted him to a seat next to his.\n\n\"We wanted to make him a part of it as much as possible,\" O'Dowd said.\n\nOlson attended strategy meetings and enthusiastically encouraged players in the locker room and on the sideline at games. He chose to spend his last day with sight at a USC practice.\n\n\"There were nights of crying and stressful times when I couldn't get the thought of going blind out of my psyche,\" Olson said. \"But every time I was up at SC or talking to one of the players or just being around, it was just pure fun.\n\n\"And, truthfully, pure peace.\"\n\nFive days after surgery, with some guidance from his team, Olson played center in a flag football game for his middle school.\n\n\"I learned quickly that I need to use other senses and realized that by using these other senses that things were possible,\" he said. \"It wasn't limiting, it was just a different way of doing it.\"\n\nCarroll left USC to become coach of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks after the 2009 season but he remains connected to Olson and his family.\n\n\"He's always blown me away, how much confidence he has and how capable he is and what a factor he is with people he meets,\" Carroll said. \"I just love the fact we had a chance to meet him and watch him grow up.\"\n\nOlson visited Carroll several times in Seattle and at the last two Super Bowls.\n\n\"I think he sees me in the same way as one of his players,\" Olson said. \"Like, 'He's got a challenge and I'm going to help him drive through it, and I'm going to be standing there just smiling at him the whole way when I see him prospering.'\"\n\nOlson also stays in contact by text message with players such as O'Dowd and Barkley. O'Dowd, who has attended USC games with the teen, said Olson inspired players with his courage.\n\n\"I was going through a difficult point with injuries,\" O'Dowd said, recalling 2009. \"It made my bad days look amazing and really put things in perspective for me.\n\n\"We really healed each other that year.\"\n\n---\n\nOlson sat in the stands during football games in his first two years at Orange Lutheran High, but he longed to play a sport he loved.\n\nWhen he broached the idea of becoming a long snapper, the only position that does not require a player to visually track the ball or the movements of opponents, his mother feared he might be rebuffed. Or injured.\n\n\"I wasn't sure that was a good idea,\" she said.\n\nOlson sought out Orange Lutheran Coach Chuck Petersen near the end of 2012 and asked if he could join the team. Petersen told him to return after the team finished out that season.\n\n\"I didn't want to kill the kid's spirit, so I just said 'Oh, OK'... and thought I'll probably never hear about this again,'\" Petersen said.\n\nOlson showed up in the spring and again asked for an opportunity.\n\n\"I told Jake, 'You of all people don't want this to be a charity case; you're going to have to earn your spot,' \" Petersen said.\n\nProgress was initially slow - \"You can't say, 'See how I'm throwing this ball?' \" said Dean Vieselmeyer, an assistant coach - but Olson practiced relentlessly.\n\nAs Olson began mastering technique, the speed and accuracy of his snaps improved and he won the starting position.\n\nTeammates would guide Olson onto the field and help him line up with the ball, but he otherwise performed as any other player.\n\n\"We didn't see him as a blind person,\" kicker Jerry Fitschen said. \"We saw him as a football player.\"\n\nOlson experienced a memorable moment last season against Servite High in Anaheim. Orange Lutheran trailed by a large margin but fought back to within three, 25-22.\n\nWith a few minutes left, Olson came on for the snap for a field-goal attempt. He lined up and experienced something for the first time: Amid the noise of a boisterous crowd, \"everything kind of got quieter,\" he said, and recalled thinking, \"Well this is pretty cool.\"\n\nThe snap, hold and kick were perfect, and Orange Lutheran tied the score.\n\n---\n\nOlson's is the kind of resume that would impress any college admissions official:\n\nHe has a 4.3 grade-point average. He played varsity football and golf, sang in the school choir, co-wrote two faith-based books about overcoming adversity and has been featured several times on national television. He is also an accomplished public speaker and, through his Out of Sight Faith foundation, raises money to put technology in the hands of the blind.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 195-pound Olson has been admitted to USC, but not as one of the university's incoming 24-player football recruiting class. He is a recipient of a Swim With Mike scholarship, awarded annually from the Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship fund.\n\nSwim With Mike began in 1981 as a benefit for former USC swimmer Mike Nyeholt, who was paralyzed from the chest down in a motorcycle accident. It has since raised more than $16 million and has funded scholarships at 85 universities, said Ron Orr, a USC senior associate athletic director and former Trojans swimmer who founded the program.\n\nAn annual swim-a-thon at USC on April 11 generated more than $950,000, with six satellite fundraisers scheduled in the next four weeks.\n\nOlson, 18, was introduced as a Swim With Mike scholarship winner in February during an event where video highlights of incoming football players were shown to Trojans fans. He would join the program as a walk-on.\n\nOlson said he was \"stoked\" to be headed to USC, which also accepted his sister.\n\n\"It's a dream come true,\" he said.\n\n---\n\nOlson has a guide dog named Quebec but handles most everyday tasks without assistance. He zips his fingers across his iPhone and sends text messages using the device's VoiceOver screen reader, which translates speech to text.\n\nOut on the golf course, Brian Olson serves as his son's caddie and eyes. They talk about club selection, the slope of the terrain and hazards such as sand bunkers, trees and lakes. At the tee, Jake sets his feet and Brian kneels, grasps the end of the club and squares the club head to the ball. Then he steps back and Jake rips a shot down the fairway.\n\nJake, who typically shoots in the 80s, said not having sight can be an advantage. \"I'm not staring at a huge lake, thinking, 'Oh no, there's a huge lake?' \" he said. \"I'm just focused on the mechanics of the swing.\"\n\nOn greens, Jake walks the path between his ball and the hole, reading surface undulations with his feet.\n\n\"It's definitely created a bond,\" Brian said of the golf partnership. \"I treasure that. It's become a gift that's drawn us closer together.\"\n\nMarianne Brizendine, Olson's grandmother, helps shuttle Olson to football workouts and practices. She said she has never heard him complain.\n\n\"One time I said, 'Jake, how are you feeling?' And he says, 'You know Grandma, the only thing I'd really like someday, I'd really like to be able to open my eyes and see the greens when I'm playing golf.'\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n---\n\nSteve Sarkisian, USC's football coach, wouldn't be surprised if a movie were made about Olson's journey.\n\nContributing to an extra point or field goal for the Trojans could be part of the story.\n\n\"Someday, he's going to snap in a game for us,\" Sarkisian said. \"When? I don't know. But it will happen.\"\n\nHe added, \"When that day comes, it will be awesome.\"\n\nCarroll would not be surprised. \"I can't even fathom what an extraordinary thing that would be,\" he said.\n\nOlson is not expecting special treatment.\n\n\"Just the opportunity,\" he said, \"to prove myself like anyone else.\"'"

            "text": "\tWith smoky barbecue scent filling the air and '80s hip-hop thumping from a speaker, two inner-city teens led their teams up and down the forest preserve field in a friendly but spirited game of pickup football.\n\nAlex, 18 and wiry, weaves across the field, making athletic catches and striding into the end zone, but Sammy, 15 and a dedicated school athlete, later returns a punt to win the game. As he sprints downfield, Sammy turns to the cheering sideline, his face breaking into a smile, reflecting the laid-back vibe of a summer day. The madness is miles away.\n\nAlex and Sammy live in a place where porches get shot up and the menacing slide of a passing van's door can carry a deadly threat. Surviving demands rapid decisions, urgent navigation to safety or, as Sammy - who counts three near-misses in his life - describes it, just dumb luck.\n\nFor 12 weeks at a time, the YMCA of Metro Chicago is pairing kids from one of the Chicago neighborhoods on edge with people who know well the struggle of surviving a dangerous place: military veterans who fought in the nation's two most recent wars. Youths from Little Village, including Sammy and Alex, were part of the pilot Urban Warriors run by the YMCA and the Adler School of Professional Psychology. The program is part of a broader effort by the Y to focus on treating mental and emotional wounds that youths growing up in Chicago's more fractured communities suffer.\n\nIn the first six months of this year, homicides in Chicago held even at 171, but the number of shooting victims was up 8 percent, with 1,103 people wounded. Though homicides have dropped significantly from the early 1990s, when as many as 900 people were slain, Chicago still ranks tops among the nation's larger cities in shootings and homicides. In neighborhoods such as Little Village, Englewood and Roseland, the threat seems as constant and consistent as ever, no matter what the stats say.\n\nThat kind of violence takes a toll on young people - especially if they also face challenges such as poverty, dysfunctional families or incarcerated parents, said Eddie Bocanegra, one of the executive directors of the YMCA's new initiative. Some teens cope through drinking or drugs, and they feel edgy. That can fuel violent behavior, Bocanegra contends.\n\nOn a recent weekend, as more than 80 people were shot, 16 fatally, Chicago once again made national news for its violence. These are the youths who face it daily. And this is one effort, though small, to help them cope.\n\nSome of the teens in Urban Warriors have been referred by the justice system or by their schools; others were recruited by the Y's violence intervention workers. But they all share high exposure to trauma, including violence. Many of the teens are involved with gangs.\n\nThe vets and youths in the program have shared \"war stories,\" of losing friends and witnessing violence. Each week, a kid seemed to arrive with a fresh battle story.\n\n\"I've seen people get shot,\" said Alex, whose mind flashes back to those events. \"It does ... mess my head up. But I am living it every day. So, like, I guess I put up with it.\"\n\nEven at age 15, Sammy has not one, but three \"war stories\" to tell.\n\n\"We passed through 24th and Millard, and some dude on a bike came out and started shooting, saying, 'Where you from, where you from?' We turned real quick. We ran across real quick. I was like, 'Let's go, let's go!'\"\n\nThat was the first shooting Sammy recalled. Then there was one at his high school as he left varsity practice.\n\n\"Right when I walked outside they shot someone at the corner. Then they started chasing me and shooting ... I got away. Again. That was my second time.\"\n\nIn the third shooting incident, Sammy, who is not in a gang, escaped a spray of gunfire on a porch where he was sitting. In his haste to get away, he fell down the porch stairs and landed in a good hiding place. \"I got behind a tree luckily,\" he said, \"and they didn't see me.\"\n\nBocanegra and his co-director, Ryan Lugalia-Hollon, started designing trauma-based treatment programs a year ago across the city. By the end of the year, they will have served 400 youths and 100 parents. Urban Warriors was launched in Little Village but will expand into South Chicago at the end of the summer.\n\nVets chosen for the project, after two rounds of interviews, indicated a willingness to work with at-risk youths. They also suffered stress from having served. And many, having grown up in Little Village too, talked of their own scrapes with trouble or of having family members involved in violence. One, Alberto Boleres - who survived a roadside bomb near Tikrit, Iraq, in 2007 - had been shot in Chicago.\n\nOrganizers of Urban Warriors also saw a critical benefit to the veterans - providing a sense of purpose, something many who leave the military crave but struggle to find, they said.\n\nGrady Osten-Garner Jr., coordinator of the military clinical psychology track at Adler and himself a veteran, facilitated weekly discussions about topics such as loyalty, brotherhood, belonging and manhood. In one conversation, a veteran who was wounded and left on the side of a road for more than an hour shared how he broke down in tears after being rescued.\n\nIt was a conversation about image, the pressure to maintain it and how that translates on the street.\n\n\"These kids are poor. Financial (capital), they don't have. Social capital? It's the gang leaders, the playboys of the neighborhood. The capital they actually have is reputation,\" Bocanegra said. \"Reputation means a lot for these kids. And what that reputation means is, 'I have to maintain an image.' Because at the end of the day, it's about protecting yourself.\"\n\nThe vets could relate to the youths on some levels.\n\n\"They always said they had to be on point or aware or careful,\" said Richard Rivera, 30, who served in the Marines. \"We told them we can relate a lot. Except you guys are fighting for a street corner, and we are fighting for a country.\"\n\nAdler researchers have been studying Urban Warriors and will evaluate whether there was a reduction in stress for the youths and the vets. What seemed obvious, as the program wound down, was that a bond had formed between the two groups.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - It was a shoulder injury during his junior year of high school that ended Derek Micheau's dreams of being a pitcher. Later that season, a knee injury ended his hopes of playing catcher.\n\nTurns out he didn't need healthy shoulders or knees for a college athletic scholarship.\n\nMicheau earned a scholarship to play video games at Robert Morris University Illinois. The small school in Chicago became the first U.S. university to offer scholarships for video gaming when it launched its eSports program this fall. The school gave out 35 scholarships to gamers from around the country.\n\n\"My mom thought it was a scam,\" said Michaeu, a 20-year-old freshman from Olympia, Washington.\n\nTurns out, some parents might want to think twice before telling their kids to turn off the computer. Micheau's scholarship pays for half of his tuition, room and board, which at full price runs more than $30,000.\n\nThe teams are a part of the athletics department at Robert Morris, which has about 2,500 students at its Chicago campus and about 6,000 across several campuses in Illinois. The school spent $100,000 turning a computer lab into an eSports Arena with fast-processing computers, large monitors, high-end ergonomic gaming chairs and a strict no-food-or-drink policy.\n\nThe gamers play \"League of Legends,\" a multiplayer online battle arena, or MOBA, that groups players into teams in head-to-head battles. The game requires each player to take on certain roles with certain skills. The goal is to knock down an opponent's tower before the opponent knocks down theirs.\n\nThe two teams on Robert Morris' varsity squad are undefeated this year, playing against college club teams in leagues.\n\nThe eSport athletes, as the school calls them, took part in the university's homecoming rally. They are outfitted with team-branded hoodies and jackets, like most other scholarship athletes. The co-ed team has five coaches - one head coach and four assistants.\n\n\"We're definitely taking it seriously. We want them to do well,\" said Kurt Melcher, associate athletic director and program coordinator.\n\nIt was his idea to launch the program to attract a diverse assortment of students to the school. The national attention - the program has been featured by ESPN, NPR, HBO's \"Real Sports\" and a variety of other outlets - has been a \"nice byproduct,\" Melcher said.\n\nAnother byproduct has been some confusion, which has always been an issue for Robert Morris University Illinois and Robert Morris University in Moon, Pennsylvania. The school in Moon owns the trademark for the Robert Morris University name, and it fielded a lot of calls from interested gamers when the program was announced last spring.\n\n\"This isn't the first time this has happened,\" said Jim Duzyk, sports information director at the Moon college.. Still \"this has been without question the most visible that it has gotten.\"\n\nDuzyk has a stock email he sends to students interested in video game scholarships who confuse the two schools, named after one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. But there were so many calls that the school in Moon posted a letter on its athletics website.\n\n\"Sorry, gamers,\" the letter read. \"If you are looking for a scholarship to play 'League of Legends,' you've come to the wrong Robert Morris University.\"\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek letter hopes some of those gamers will consider its school anyway.\n\n\"While we can't give you a scholarship for playing video games, as one of the nation's most wired campuses, we do offer plenty of bandwidth for you to do so, anytime you like - after you've finished studying, of course.\"\n\nThe team is not a revenue generator for Robert Morris University Illinois, but most college sports teams aren't, except for high-profile football and men's basketball teams. The school has partnered with a few companies that sponsor the team.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure we jumped on it as fast as possible because I knew this would be a big deal. There was no way it couldn't be,\" said John Spiher, marketing director at DXRacer USA, which sells gaming chairs and sponsors the team. The company outfitted Robert Morris' eSports arena with one of its chair models, which retails for $349.\n\nThe scholarship program is just the next step in a burgeoning industry. The best professional gamers earn six figures through sponsorship deals and competition winnings. There was more than $25 million available in prize money in 2013, a 350 percent increase since the start of the decade, according to Jim Yang, global chief strategy officer at Nurun, a global design and technology consultancy headquartered in Montreal.\n\nThe gaming industry as a whole generates $25 billion in annual revenue, according to the Entertainment Software Association, a Washington-based trade group.\n\nThe \"League of Legends\" finals in 2013 sold out at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The 2014 finals, held last month, drew more than 40,000 fans to a former World Cup soccer stadium in Seoul. Millions more watched online.\n\nBecause of the popularity, it might not be long before other schools try to join Robert Morris.\n\nSpiher, who also is a student at Eastern Michigan University and president of LOL(at)EMU, the school's \"League of Legends\" club, said gamers are the kind of students who are attractive to a university.\n\n\"They're problem solvers,\" Spiher said. \"That's what a game is. You have a certain goal, and you come across a lot of problems in the way of that goal. It's the same way in college.\"\n\nWhether it's a sport remains up for debate.\n\nESPN President John Skipper said during a conference earlier this year that his network is mostly interested in \"real sports\" and that he didn't believe video games fell into that category.\n\n\"It's not a sport,\" he said. \"It's a competition, right? I mean, chess is a competition, and checkers is a competition.\"\n\nThe network does, however, televise poker tournaments, noted Nancy Donohoe, director of public relations at Robert Morris.\n\n\"It's kind of cool to see kids who might've been in the shadows say 'I got an athletic scholarship, too,'\" she said.\n\nKevin Kuan, president of Club eSports at Carnegie Mellon University, said the recent gains have helped erase some of the stigma associated with gaming.\n\n\"I think it's pretty cool people are starting to be more open-minded, not seeing video gamers as nerds in a basement,\" he said.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon teams are among the best on the East Coast, he said, though they are run a little differently than the scholarship team in Chicago. While Robert Morris practices every day and has classes scheduled around practice times, the Carnegie Mellon team is lucky if it can practice once a week.\n\n\"They have all the resources that any normal sports team would play with,\" Kuan said.\n\nStill, if the two schools ever went head-to-head, Kuan would give his team a 50-50 shot to win.\n\n\"I still think we could put up a pretty good match against them,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - From afar, it looks and sounds like a regular recreational baseball game: the crack of the bat, the cheering from the bench, the sliding into home.\n\nBut a closer glance at this field in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park shows something isn't quite right. They're pitching underhand. No one is using a batting helmet, fielding glove or catcher's mask. And what's up with those floppy hats and groomed mustaches?\n\n\"Striker to the line!\" bellows a man wearing a straw hat, suit and bow tie.\n\nTranslation: \"Batter up!\"\n\nThis is not your father's baseball. Or even your grandfather's baseball. It's your great-great-grandfather's game.\n\nThe Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia plays America's favorite pastime the old-fashioned way. It's one of a growing number of teams nationwide that recreates the 19th century through historically accurate uniforms, period rules and cheeky nicknames. And by spelling \"baseball\" as two words.\n\n\"It brings people back to a simpler time, before million-dollar contracts, TVs, cars, steroids and gloves,\" said Mid-Atlantic Vintage Base Ball League commissioner Bruce \"Early\" Leith.\n\nLeith, who is never early, also serves as president of the Eclipse Base Ball Club of Elkton, Maryland. Eight years ago, he said, there were only three teams in that area. Today, there are 14.\n\n\"We get calls all the time from people wanting to start a club,\" said Leith.\n\nBaseball mythology has long held the game was invented in 1839 by Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, New York. But researchers now say its regulations began to be codified in the 1840s by Alexander Cartwright and the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club of New York City.\n\nThose bylaws were frequently revised, giving today's vintage teams a variety of old rulebooks to choose from. The Mid-Atlantic league, which includes the Athletic and about 20 other squads from Rhode Island to Virginia, plays by what are called the 1864 rules.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between then and now is that fielders could catch a batted ball on one bounce to make an out - an understandable accommodation for players trying to handle a hard ball without gloves. Such equipment didn't become common until later.\n\nThe Athletic club, named after the Philadelphia team founded in 1859, formed about five years ago after co-founder Scott \"Big Deal\" Alberts started researching the sport's deep roots in the city. His teammates, called \"ballists,\" comprise a range of ages, athletic ability and occupations.\n\nThe squad sets a high standard for historical accuracy during its weekly games. Their wool uniforms, which cost about $300, include mother-of-pearl buttons, a bow tie and newsboy cap. Home plate is a white disc, the bases are sand-filled canvas bags, and the beer has been brewed from a 19th century recipe.\n\n\"We try to do everything we can as close as possible to the period,\" Alberts said. \"Because if we're not doing that, we might as well just be playing softball in the park.\"\n\nSpectators Arthur and Alice Best of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, had a special appreciation for the recent Athletic game against the Delaware-based Diamond State Base Ball Club. The Bests happen to be Civil War re-enactors.\n\n\"I love that ... they're trying to be authentic by drinking out of canteens and tin cups,\" said Alice Best. \"And they have their bats in a barrel, or on an old wooden rack. It's really, really nice.\"\n\nNot all teams are such sticklers for authenticity, said Dennis \"Pops\" Wiegmann, president of the National Vintage Base Ball Association. The organization has about 65 active clubs - some dating to the 1980s - and he estimated dozens of other teams are unaffiliated with the group.\n\nBut all share a common goal: exercise and camaraderie with a historical twist.\n\n\"It gives people another way of looking at the game,\" Wiegmann said.\n\nIt gives people another way of hearing the game, too. Frequent phrases from the umpire - sometimes called the arbiter - include \"Tally!\" as a runner scores and \"The striker is dead!\" when a batter makes an out.\n\nAt which point players might let loose with a vintage curse word: \"Tarnation!\"'"

            "text": "\tALLENTOWN, Pa. - At the mention of Gettysburg, Jeff Stocker fidgets in his chair.\n\nStocker, wearing a necktie adorned with the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, turns and tilts his head slightly toward the ceiling. A smile emerges from his gray goatee.\n\nGettysburg looks different, he says. It smells different.\n\n\"Oh my God, Gettysburg is ethereal,\" Stocker says from behind the desk of his Allentown, Pa., law office. \"To be in the field at Gettysburg ... it gives me chills just talking about it.\"\n\nThe rolling farmland, just 10 miles north of the Mason-Dixon line, is where Stocker's great-grandfather put his arms around a wounded Union captain and dragged him from onrushing rebels.\n\nIt's where Stocker retraced the footsteps of both armies on summer days with his father, who wondered aloud what their Civil War ancestor looked like. It's where Stocker was Monday to mark the 150th anniversary of the three-day battle.\n\nAnd it's the inspiration for part of Stocker's latest book, \"We Fought Desperate,\" an in-depth account of eastern Pennsylvania's 153rd Volunteer Regiment, the band of novice soldiers, mostly from Northampton County, that his great-grandfather joined.\n\nOver the last seven years, he's relived Gettysburg through the letters, diaries and pension files of hundreds of men - many of whom never made it home.\n\n\"The dots on the map are people,\" said Stocker, of Center Valley, a town an hour north of Philadelphia. \"I hope you realize that this is a real-life person with a real-life family. Chances are, just like you.\"\n\nOne of those dots on the map is Heinrich Feirich, a 40-year-old Prussian immigrant and shoemaker.\n\nFeirich's wife was pregnant, but that didn't stop him from volunteering for a nine-month enlistment with the 153rd Pennsylvania in September 1862. Only four months into his enlistment, Pvt. Feirich began suffering from deafness and was reassigned as a servant for Capt. George Young. Feirich did his company's washing and assisted Young.\n\nBy late June 1863, Confederate forces under Gen. Robert E. Lee were invading the North. As Lee's army plundered the countryside, the 153rd marched 10 miles over four hours on the morning of July 1 and came to a grassy hilltop on the northeast corner of Gettysburg's battlefield. Positioned too far from the rest of the 11th Corps, the regiment got hit hard by Confederate troops who charged out of a thicket of trees.\n\nCapt. Young, shot in the face, was among more than 250 from the regiment to be wounded, killed or captured.\n\nFeirich, trying to save Young from being captured, began dragging him from the battlefield. He stopped when Young ordered him to save himself and run, Stocker's research found. Young was captured and survived the war.\n\nFeirich completed his nine-month tour of duty and enlisted in the 51st Pennsylvania. He deserted in April 1864 and was captured, spending two weeks in prison. Desperate for bodies, the Union Army added him back to its ranks.\n\nFeirich was shot in the left knee, an injury that plagued him for the rest of his life. After the war, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen and died in 1894.\n\nOne of Feirich's daughters, Emma, born in 1877, married Albert Stocker. In February 1919, she gave birth to the last of her 14 children: Donald Stocker, Jeff Stocker's father.\n\nAfter fighting in World War II, Donald Stocker married and started his own family. From the time Jeff was old enough to walk, his dad took him to Gettysburg.\n\nAs they walked the battlefield, Donald Stocker would talk about Feirich. \"I wonder where Feirich was,\" Stocker would say to his son. \"I wish I had a photo of Feirich.\"\n\nJeff Stocker inherited his father's love of reading about the Civil War and World War II. He is especially drawn to primary sources, such as copies of Civil War soldiers' handwritten journals and diaries. He's collected about 1,000 manuscripts and donates a copy of each one to Gettysburg's library.\n\nIn 1990, when he was donating a manuscript from the 4th Alabama regiment, Scott Hartwig, a Gettysburg historian, made a suggestion.\n\n\"Why don't you try to publish it?\" he asked.\n\nStocker edited the manuscript and the University of Tennessee Press published \"From Huntsville to Appomattox, Robert T. Coles' History of the 4th Alabama.\" Then with Ed Root, he co-wrote \"Isn't This Glorious,\" which traces the steps of the 15th, 19th and 20th Massachusetts regiments, which all fought at Gettysburg.\n\nBy the time \"Isn't This Glorious\" was published in 2006, Donald Stocker was in his mid-80s. He was still visiting Gettysburg, retracing the steps of Pickett's charge, and Jeff Stocker thought his father would get a kick out of reading about Heinrich Feirich and the 153rd.\n\n\"I figured if I'm going to do this, I want to know as much about every single person as I can,\" Jeff said. \"All 993 people.\"\n\nHe pored over newspaper obituaries at the Easton Public Library, made trips to the National Archives in Washington to examine pension records and read every diary, newspaper account and letter that he could find. The research, including a knee-high stack of 993 census records, is stuffed into file folders in Stocker's office, where he's maintained his day job as a personal injury attorney.\n\n\"My wife doesn't want any of this at home,\" he says of the stacks of paper records.\n\nThe title, \"We Fought Desperate,\" is a quote from a soldier describing Chancellorsville, fought in Virginia two months before Gettysburg and the other major battle where the 153rd fired volleys at the rebels.\n\nThis week thousands are gathering at Gettysburg for the anniversary, but Donald Stocker will not be with them. He died last summer at 93. Stocker placed a manuscript of \"We Fought Desperate\" in his coffin.\n\nStocker knows that if his father were alive, he'd be on the old battlefield this week, walking in the footsteps of his ancestor.'"

            "text": "\tAKRON, Ohio - The gladiators' legs were tucked inside their machines. On their hands, they placed a foam-like wrap, followed by gloves and duct tape, sticky side up. It was time to do battle.\n\nWheelchair rugby was originally called murderball, and for good reason. It's a fierce game with metal-on-metal and sometimes skin-on-floor contact.\n\nThe six guys who make up this team, which practices for about three hours each Friday night in Tallmadge, Ohio, are all quadriplegics, meaning that they have varying loss of function in all four limbs, mostly from injuries suffered in accidents.\n\nAt the age of 16, Nathan Gay was accidentally shot in the neck when a friend was putting away a shotgun they had used while hunting.\n\nAustin Geib, at 15, was hanging upside down on a pull-up bar when the bar fell, breaking his neck.\n\nIn high school, Adam Sweeney was injured in a car accident that killed his brother.\n\nYianni Thallas was about 20 when he got hurt diving off a roof into a pool.\n\nStephen Zuravel was just a teen when he was severely injured in a one-car accident.\n\nAnd Jamal Saxton was born with muscular dystrophy.\n\nAs might be expected, such serious disabilities can be devastating. What once was natural, like buttoning a shirt, is now a chore, or impossible. For some, depression can take a toll, and finding an escape from their suddenly sedentary lifestyles can be a challenge.\n\n\"I have been competitive all of my life. But once I broke my neck, I didn't know what I was going to do,\" said Geib, now 18, who attends high school online. \"This (wheelchair rugby) brought back that competitive edge.\"\n\nThe sport, once known as murderball because the idea was to \"murder\" the competition, is a mix of basketball and demolition derby.\n\n\"It lifts my spirit and makes me feel normal,\" said Gay, 27, a recent Kent State grad from Streetsboro, Ohio. It was a comment that was repeated by most of his teammates.\n\nZuravel, 23, of Stow, Ohio, was in search of something that would push his physical limitations and decided to attend a practice.\n\n\"I remember when I was on my way there, I shoved a couple of pieces of pizza down and thought to myself, 'This isn't going to be hard. I've done marathons (on a hand cycle).' So I was pretty cocky going into it. Very quickly I was humbled,\" said the University of Akron mechanical engineering student, laughing. \"Sometimes when I go to tournaments there are guys twice my age who I'm having a hard time keeping up with on the court. So it put me in my place pretty quick.\"\n\nAdam Sweeney, 34, who has a master's degree in social work from Youngstown State University, said there was only one thing missing after his accident.\n\n\"I accepted my life right away. I decided that I was still going to get everything that I've ever wanted - a job, a house and a wife. And that's what I have,\" said Sweeney, a service support administrator for Mahoning County's Board of Developmental Disabilities. \"So when I heard about rugby, I said, 'That's the last component to put my life back to normal.'\"\n\nThe athletes, some of whom admit the game is much less violent than people think, play for the Buckeye Blitz wheelchair rugby team in Columbus. Come next season, starting in September, they will break off to become their own team, the Akron Rhinos. And that means they are aggressively looking for new players who have some form of impairment in at least three limbs.\n\nZuravel is known by his teammates as \"Queen Bee\" because of his nudging and encouragement of players to do their best, as well as his persistent lobbying of others with physical disabilities to give the game a try.\n\n\"You might think it's weird and not for you, but just come to a practice and try the sport - for the betterment of your health,\" said Zuravel. \"See what it does for you.\"\n\nAble-bodied men and women are also needed to play with the team during practices, added Thallas, 32, a network engineer from Parma Heights, Ohio.\n\nCoach Megan Haas, 24, who works in Springfield Township, Ohio, at a private school for children with autism, explained that exercise for those with spinal cord injuries is even more important than for those who have never been hurt.\n\n\"We can walk everywhere; they can't. With a physical disability like they have ... they are dependent on somebody else after their accident,\" said Haas, who has a master's degree in adaptive physical activity. \"It's so awesome to see people with disabilities play at a competitive level and become more independent.\"\n\nBoth the Columbus team and the local rugby players are sponsored by the Adaptive Sports Program of Ohio (ASPO), based in Wooster. The nonprofit association is designed to help folks with physical disabilities by providing competitive and recreational adaptive sports opportunities throughout the state. In addition to wheelchair rugby, ASPO offers sports including swimming, archery, sled hockey, soccer and softball.\n\nSpecial wheelchairs are needed to play rugby and are provided by ASPO.\n\nSince there are so few wheelchair rugby teams, most of the games are played outside Ohio, though ASPO Executive Director Lisa Followay and Zuravel are in search of a local indoor basketball court, or several courts, large enough to hold a wheelchair rugby tournament.\n\nDuring a recent scrimmage on practice night inside the gym at the Summit DD administration building, Sarah Lucas, an independent home care provider for Austin, explained that the duct tape, turned sticky side up, is used to give the players a better grip. Each player wrapped layer after layer of the stuff around his hands and arms.\n\n\"Because most don't have fingers that can grab, the duct tape helps,\" said Lucas, of Conneaut, Ohio. Additionally, she added, the sports pre-wrap, gloves and tape keep the skin on their hands and arms protected from injury.\n\nIn their armored wheelchairs, the players went onto the court inside, looks of determination on their faces. The Queen Bee kept a close eye on his teammates. The chairs slammed into each other, giving off a thundering smack.\n\nSaxton, a senior in criminal justice at the University of Akron, is 25, a mountain of a man from Bedford. A grin spread on his face when he saw a defensive player coming his way.\n\nBAM!\n\nOff the court, he chuckled. \"I love hitting people.\"'"

            "title": "Back to Beijing for second Olympics in 14 years",
            "text": "\tKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Throughout more than 120 years of Olympic history, no city has hosted both the winter and summer games. Now, Beijing will be the first do it - and in the span of just 14 years.\n\nThe Chinese capital was awarded the 2022 Winter Olympics on Friday, beating Kazakh rival Almaty 44-40 in a surprisingly close vote marred by technical problems, taking the Olympic Games back to the city that hosted the summer version in 2008.\n\nBeijing was seen by the International Olympic Committee as a secure, reliable choice that also offered vast commercial opportunities in a new winter sports market of more than 300 million people in northern China.\n\n\"It really is a safe choice,\" IOC President Thomas Bach said. \"We know China will deliver on its promises.\"\n\nThe IOC's secret vote was conducted by paper ballot, after the first electronic vote experienced technical faults with the voting tablets and was not counted. The result of the first vote was not disclosed. There was one abstention in the paper ballot.\n\nBach bristled when asked at a news conference about the possibility of any voting irregularities.\n\n\"This is an unfair question,\" he said. \"You are taking a lot of assumptions. ... Obviously there was a technical issue with the voting system, the devices. If the scrutineers decide to be on the very safe side to have a new vote, to have this vote on a ballot paper, then this speaks for itself for a very fair election in everybody's interest.\"\n\nBeijing came in to the vote as the strong favorite, despite its lack of natural snow.\n\nAlmaty had hoped to bring the games to Central Asia for the first time, but was a lesser-known quantity and viewed as a riskier choice by IOC members. Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov made a last-minute impassioned plea for the IOC to be \"brave\" and give the games to his country.\n\n\"Almaty is not a risky choice for 2022,\" Massimov told the IOC delegates. \"In fact, we are quite the opposite ... We are a golden opportunity to prove that smaller, advancing nations can successfully host the Winter Games.\"\n\nThe tight margin caught most IOC members by surprise.\n\n\"Gee, you wouldn't have picked that close result a few months ago,\" IOC Vice President John Coates of Australia said. \"That address by the prime minister today was brilliantly crafted. I think that's why it got close. But the size of China, the number of people that are going to be introduced to winter sport now, those were all factors.\"\n\nFriday's results means the Olympics will be held three times in a row in east Asia: the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, and 2022 in Beijing.\n\n\"With the real globalization of the world, the growing importance of Asia, not only in sports but also in all areas of life, I think it is more or less normal that we have more Olympic Games taking place in Asia,\" Bach said.\n\nThe IOC decision was met with sharp criticism from human rights groups, who said the situation in China has not improved since the 2008 Olympics. Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, called it a \"a slap in the face to China's besieged human rights activists.\"\n\n\"Over the next seven years, the IOC has enormous work to do in China to win the credibility on human rights that will ensure a successful Olympics,\" she said.\n\nBeijing and Almaty had both been considered longshots when the 2022 bid race opened two years ago. But they were the only two candidates left after four European cities - including Oslo and Stockholm - pulled out for political or financial reasons.\n\nThe contest was a study in contrasts between the world's most populous nation and a former Soviet republic seeking to establish itself on the world stage. China's political and economic might was a big advantage against its northwestern neighbor, which became independent in 1991.\n\nAlmaty Olympic Vice Chairman Andrey Kryukov said the city would consider bidding again.\n\n\"One thing I can say is Almaty was ready to host the 2022 Winter Games,\" he said.\n\nBeijing plans to use several venues from the 2008 Olympics, including the Bird's Nest and Water Cube. But the snow and sliding events would be at venues in Yangqing and Zhangjiakou, 60 and 140 kilometers (40 and 90 miles) outside Beijing. A planned high-speed rail line to Zhangjiakou is supposed to cut travel time to 50 minutes.'"

            "title": "In 1950, U.S. team shocked the world in Brazil",
            "text": "\tThe United States national soccer team took off for the World Cup in Brazil after months of hype and fanfare.\n\nThere was much discussion about the roster, a three-game send-off series that averaged just fewer than 35,000 fans apiece and even an ESPN film crew following the team around for a multi-part documentary series.\n\nSuffice it to say, things were just a bit different 64 years ago when Walter Bahr and his U.S. teammates took off for Brazil. Bahr, a former Penn State soccer coach, is one of two surviving members of the 1950 U.S. soccer team. That year was the last time Brazil hosted the sport's global showcase.\n\nThere was little ado when they left and when the players came home after having pulled off one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history, they were hardly greeted as returning heroes.\n\n\"We couldn't even get the whole team on one flight,\" Bahr, 87, said. \"We came back on three separate days and my wife was the only one at the airport that met me.\"\n\nToday, soccer appears to be finding a solid place in the American sports landscape. Back in Bahr's playing days, though, the sport was generally confined to ethnic enclaves within major cities. Bahr grew up playing soccer in Philadelphia.\n\nSo when the team for the 1950 World Cup was announced, it wasn't exactly big news across the country.\n\n\"The team was picked, told when to report and where, and that's where we went,\" Bahr said by telephone from his home near State College, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"One of our better players at that time was a player named Ben McLaughlin from Philadelphia. He made the team but had to cancel because his boss at work wouldn't give him time off. He had just gotten married and had a baby, so it was important that he held on to his job.\"\n\nThose who did make the trip had a formidable task ahead of them. Much like the \"Group of Death\" (Ghana, Portugal and Germany) facing this year's team, the 1950 squad had a tough slate of group games against Spain, England and Chile.\n\nIt wasn't realistic to think this group of part-time players from across the country could advance out of the group, so the main goal, really, was just to not get embarrassed by one of the European powerhouses.\n\nIt didn't take long for the U.S. team to exceed expectations.\n\nJust 17 minutes into his team's World Cup opener against Spain, Gino Pariani - who rescheduled his wedding to make it to Brazil - put the Americans ahead, 1-0.\n\nBahr and his teammates held on to that lead for 64 minutes, until Spain scored three times in the final nine minutes to take a 3-1 win. Still, the game proved that the United States might just be able to play with these European teams.\n\n\"I thought Spain was the best we played of the three games in the tournament,\" Bahr said. \"We had no practice.\"\n\nBahr said a major reason for the team's success was coach Bill Jeffrey (who coached Penn State at the time) and his insistence on playing players at their natural positions, rather than trying to put together a makeshift all-star lineup.\n\n\"He didn't take players and say, 'Boy he's a good player, he can play anywhere,' \" Bahr said. \"He gets a lot of credit for not re-inventing or changing players around for such a short tournament. Other teams had much more practice. We had a few days and not much time to change.\"\n\nHeading into the second game against England, Bahr said there wasn't much talk amongst the team about any potential results, positive or negative.\n\n\"(Jeffrey's) main comment was, 'Look, we're the underdogs, but the score's 0-0 when we start. We all can play. Give it your best shot, let's see what happens,' \" Bahr recalled. \"He never mentioned once about winning the game, but he never mentioned that we were being led to slaughter.\"\n\nIn truth, it would have been foolish to think the United States could beat the mighty English. This was England's first appearance at a World Cup, and they were considered one of the favorites to challenge host Brazil for the title.\n\nDespite the surprisingly hard-fought loss against Spain, the United States was still just two years removed from being embarrassed by Italy, 9-0, at the 1948 Olympics.\n\n\"When the game was played, we were 500-to-1 odds,\" Bahr said. \"No one expected us to do anything.\"\n\nBut, like Jeffrey said, the match had to start 0-0.\n\nAnd it remained 0-0, improbably, for most of the first half.\n\nEngland had some quality chances but was denied by American goalkeeper Frank Borghi as well as the goalposts a couple of times.\n\n\"England should've scored a couple of early goals but they didn't, they hit the woodwork and so forth, but they didn't, it was still 0-0,\" Bahr said. \"As that first half continued, I don't know that we got any more confidence, but we continued doing what we were doing and it was fairly successful.\"\n\nIn the 38th minute, Bahr took a throw-in from Ed McIlvenny and fired a shot at goal from about 25 yards out. At the same time, forward Joe Gaetjens moved toward the penalty spot and flung his head toward the ball.\n\nGaetjens caught just enough of it to change the ball's path and catch English goalkeeper Bert Williams flatfooted. Just like that, the Americans, almost impossibly, had a 1-0 lead.\n\nAs the game continued to tick away, rather than pack everything in defensively, Jeffrey told his team to keep up the strategy that worked for them in the first half. Keep taking the game to England rather than sitting back.\n\n\"The second half, our instructions from Bill Jeffrey were no more than encouragement,\" Bahr said. \"He was a Scottish guy. He said, 'Lads, let's keep up the good work. Let's keep doing what we're doing and see what happens.' \"\n\nWhile England continued to generate scoring chance after scoring chance, Borghi, a former baseball player, was up to the task.\n\nLate in the game, American Charlie Colombo brought down an English player near the edge of the 18-yard box. While even Bahr admits now it probably warranted a penalty kick, referee Generoso Dattilo instead ruled it outside the box and the United States held its lead.\n\nEven though Bahr estimates that England controlled about 75-80 percent of the possession over the course of the game, when the final whistle sounded, the scoreboard still read 1-0 in favor of the United States.\n\n\"Possession doesn't count,\" he said. \"The goal counts, and we got the goal.\"\n\nIf there's a reason Bahr can recite the details of that game so well, it's that he has to do it frequently - about once every four years.\n\n\"Each time there's a World Cup that gets played, that game gets more attention. When we won that game, some of the papers didn't report it,\" he said.\n\nSome papers just assumed the 1-0 U.S. win was a misprint. Despite the historic result, the victory hardly inspired a soccer revolution in the United States.\n\nWith a 5-2 loss to Chile, the U.S. team failed to advance from group play and the players quietly flew home, back to their full-time jobs.\n\n\"I can't remember any reporter or anyone else (other than his wife) that was at the airport when we landed in the States,\" Bahr said.\n\nBahr went on to a career as a teacher and coach, his final coaching job at Penn State from 1974-88. His three sons played professional soccer and two of them, Matt and Chris, were placekickers in the NFL. Matt Bahr kicked for the Steelers in 1979 and 1980.\n\nIt would take 40 years, until 1990, for the United States to qualify for another World Cup.\n\n\"No matter where we play, whether it was at school or wherever, we understand who came before us and we respect what those guys did for us,\" said John Stollmeyer, who was born in Pittsburgh and played on that 1990 U.S. World Cup team. \"Everybody does something more to help with the future.\"\n\nEven though the 23 players in Brazil now have technology, infrastructure and support that Bahr never had, there might be some common ground.\n\nLike the 1950 team, most experts peg this U.S. team as underdogs in all of their group matches. Even former U.S. defender and ESPN analyst Alexi Lalas, with the entire team sitting about 10 feet away from him last week at a send-off event, predicted that the team would not make it out of the group stage.\n\n\"In a way, that kind of (ticked) me off a little bit,\" Stollmeyer said. \"My ultimate feeling, the way I walk on the field, is there's a way to get through. There is a possibility.\"\n\nThat 1990 team was also a heavy underdog, and though they exited that World Cup with three losses, they put a scare into host Italy in a 1-0 loss.\n\nBahr, too, said he thought this 2014 U.S. team could benefit from not being the favorite.\n\n\"Maybe that's to their favor,\" he said. \"As a player, you don't like to play teams where they're the underdog. It doesn't sit right to you.\"\n\nHe added, \"England was a big favorite and we were the underdog. Sometimes the underdog wins.\"'"

            "title": "Study of former NFL players highlights risks of tackling too young",
            "text": "\tIs there a safe time to let your kids play tackle football? That has yet to be determined, but a new study suggests you may want to wait until they are at least 12 years old.\n\nResearchers found that former NFL players who started playing tackle football before age 12 performed an average of 20 percent worse on a series of cognitive tests than those who started playing tackle football after they had celebrated their 12th birthdays.\n\nThe results were published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nTo conduct the study, the researchers recruited 42 former professional football players who were between 41 and 65 years old.\n\nHalf of the study participants had started playing tackle football before they were 12, the others started when they were 12 or older.\n\nThe two groups were then put into matched pairs based on their age at the time of the study.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure we were not addressing issues having to do with the effects of current age on cognition or the potential differences in the way the game was played or practiced in the last several decades,\" said senior author Bob Stern, a professor of neurology, neurosurgery and anatomy and neurobiology at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nThe players were given a series of cognitive tests. A memory test, for instance, required the players to remember a list of words immediately after it had been read to them, as well as 15 minutes later.\n\nThey were asked to organize a deck of cards based on various characteristics to test their mental flexibility and problem-solving skills.\n\nTo gauge their verbal intelligence, they were asked to read and pronounce a long list of uncommon words.\n\nOn all three tests, the players who had started playing tackle football before they turned 12 performed significantly worse than players of the same age who had taken up the sport later in life.\n\nThe authors noted that the participants who started playing tackle football before 12 played an average of two fewer years in the NFL than their peers, and probably sustained fewer head injuries as adults. That makes the difference between the two groups even more compelling.\n\nStern, who oversees clinical research for Boston University's Alzheimer Disease Center and the BU Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center, explained that the research team chose the age of 12 as the dividing line because it is an important time for the brain.\n\n\"Other research has shown that the brain undergoes key periods of development during childhood and that several brain structures and functions reach a peak or plateau leading up to the age of 12 in males,\" he said.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the paper, Christopher Filley of the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Charles Bernick of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health wrote that 70 percent of all football players in the U.S. are younger than 14 and that players between 9 and 12 are exposed to an average of 240 head impacts in a single football season.\n\nWhile they applauded the study as \"innovative,\" they also noted that it has significant limitations. For example, the small cohort includes only professional athletes, making it difficult to apply the results to the broader population.\n\nAlso, all of the participants were pulled from a group of former NFL players who had reported symptoms of cognitive, behavioral and mood problems in the previous six months.\n\nStern agreed with the criticism.\n\n\"Since we only dealt with former NFL players we can't generalize to people who played up to college or high school; we can't generalize to other sports; we can't generalize to girls,\" he said.\n\nHowever, if common sense tells parents that it's not a great idea to put a kid at risk of getting a head injury during a time when the brain is doing some important development work, this study seconds that notion, he said. \"Common sense may be right,\" he added.\n\n\"We do everything possible as a society to try to protect our kids, and yet we drop them off at a field at age 8, 9, 10 or younger and say, 'Go get your head hit, as many times as you want,'\" Stern said. \"And it's a lot of times.\"'"
