            "title": "Americans will shell out billions of dollars for treats this Halloween",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES, Calif. - A Batman bib-and-booties costume for $14.99 caught the eye of Joanna Robles as she searched for something for her baby son to wear while she hands out candy on Halloween.\n\n\"His dad is really obsessed with superheroes,\" Robles said while strolling through a Spirit Halloween store near Los Angeles.\n\nIn the next aisle, 35-year-old Joe Lige said he was browsing for an outfit \"on the darker, spookier side\" for a Halloween party. \"My wife gives me a budget for Halloween and I always exceed it,\" he said.\n\nThey are among the 157 million Americans expected to celebrate Halloween this year. Those people may be walking their kids around the block to get free candy, carving a pumpkin for the front window or wearing a costume for a neighborhood party.\n\n## Mega Spending Is A Treat For Businesses\n\nHalloween was once mostly for children. It has grown into a major consumer holiday that now includes 18- to 34-year-old millennials and older adults who seize the opportunity for a night to escape reality.\n\n\"It's not just for kids trick-or-treating anymore,\" said Trisha Lombardo, a spokeswoman for Spirit Halloween, which has 1,150 temporary stores that are open just for the Halloween season.\n\nConsumers altogether will spend $6.9 billion on Halloween this year, an average of $74.34 each, the National Retail Federation estimates. The figures are based on an annual survey conducted by a research firm.\n\nThe estimated spending is down from a peak of $8 billion, or $79.82 a person, in 2012. Still, it is more than double the Halloween spending of a decade ago.\n\nThe spending is done across the retail and entertainment industries, and to some extent the farming industry, where pumpkins are a big item during the season.\n\n## Plenty Of Halloween Inspirations Online\n\nBusinesses cannot point to a single reason for the jump in interest in Halloween over the past decade, but they note several factors for the holiday's current popularity.\n\nFor instance, \"the millennials are really into group costumes and activities,\" Lombardo said. \"They love to do things in groups, whether they're going as characters in 'The Walking Dead' or 'Orange Is the New Black,'\" and that drives added costume sales and theme-park attendance, she said.\n\nSocial media also has fueled the rise in Halloween's broader appeal. People love sharing information, photos and videos of their Halloween costumes, decorations and night-on-the-town escapades, analysts said.\n\nWhen people were asked where they look for inspiration for costumes, the websites Facebook and Pinterest each drew 13 percent of the responses, the National Retail Federation said. Nearly one-third of consumers said they looked online overall for Halloween costumes.\n\n\"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit,\" especially on Facebook and Instagram, Jessica Medina, 33, said as she shopped at the Spirit Halloween store. \"I also search online to see what's out there and my friends post things.\"\n\n## $2 Billion Worth Of Candy!\n\nThe impact of social media \"has been exponential,\" said Jeff Green, who advises retailers. \"The growth that's occurred in Halloween spending over the last 10 years has almost mirrored that of the growth in social media.\"\n\nConsumer spending on Halloween still pales next to the winter holiday season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas and generates about $616 billion in sales. Halloween spending also trails spending for Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Father's Day.\n\nThat is mainly because \"Halloween is not a gift-giving holiday\" much beyond candy for the kids, National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy Grannis Allen said.\n\nNonetheless, \"it's still a huge business for a retailer,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Halloween retail sales are expected to dip this year compared with 2014 as many consumers plan to re-use Halloween props and decorations they bought in recent years.\n\nOther items are perishable, of course, such as candy and pumpkins. Nine out of 10 Americans are expected to buy candy this year, spending about $2.1 billion, slightly less than the $2.2 billion spent last year.\n\n## Haunted Theme Parks Ride The Trend\n\nAbout 41 percent of Americans also will carve a fresh pumpkin. In fact, most pumpkins grown in California are for Halloween sales, which last year totaled $31 million in the state, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAnother trend is the continued growth of temporary, or \"pop-up,\" Halloween stores that lease space in vacant store-fronts or other buildings for the six weeks leading up to Halloween.\n\nOne big Halloween retailer is Party City. Halloween is very important to the company, accounting for 25 percent of Party City's $1.6 billion in annual retail sales.\n\nThen there are the haunted theme-park attractions, such as Knott's \"Scary Farm\" and \"Fright Fest\" at Six Flags Entertainment Corp.'s Magic Mountain. Both are in the Los Angeles area.\n\nKnott's does not break out its Halloween-related sales, but Knott's has said the Scary Farm generates about 15 percent of its annual attendance.\n\n\"It's a very profitable and valuable part\" of the year, Knott's spokesman Jason Soyster said. \"Parks like Knott's have capitalized on this overwhelming consumer interest in the Halloween season.\"\n\n## Spending Creeps Up\n\nOthers prefer to stay near home, handing out candy or joining parties. They include Medina, who said she and her husband try to keep their family's Halloween spending under $200, but find it tough.\n\n\"I try to,\" Medina said as she prepared to try on a $60 pirate costume. \"But it never happens because my husband and I are huge Halloween fans.\"'"

            "title": "Which disaster would you choose: Hurricane or tornado?",
            "text": "\tPALM BEACH, Fla. - Early one Saturday in August 1992, South Floridians discovered they had 48 hours to brace for, or flee, the newly formed Andrew, which would become one of the nation's most infamous hurricanes.\n\nOklahomans got all of 16 minutes warning before last week's devastating tornado. And that was more time than most past twisters have allowed.\n\nIn a grim game of \"choose your poison,\" Floridians debate with their tornado-weary friends and family about which disaster they'd rather have.\n\nHurricanes have a lot of cons: sustained, devastating winds, vicious storm surges and damage over a wider area. But \"they're the one threat we can see coming,\" said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who was Florida's emergency manager during 2004's spate of storms.\n\n## No Excuses For Being Unprepared\n\nThat advantage makes failing to prepare inexcusable, Fugate told the National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans in March. And yet studies have found - even with the start of hurricane season looming June 1 - that as many as two in three Florida residents say they have no plan for what they will do if a tropical storm threatens.\n\nPreparation helped only a little for Moore, Oklahoma, last Monday. According to a preliminary National Weather Service summary, Monday's tornado was a EF5, with top winds of 200 to 210 miles per hour (mph), and was 1.3 miles wide. It was tracked on the ground for 50 minutes - an eternity for a tornado - and its damage zone was more than 17 miles wide. EF, short for the Enhanced Fujita Scale, is a measurement of a tornado's wind speed and the damage it causes. The scale ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most powerful.\n\nOklahoma's insurance commissioner has said damages could top those from last year's Joplin, Missouri, tornado, which amounted to about $2 billion.\n\nTornadoes cover a smaller track - Monday's twister traveled 17 miles - than hurricanes, and their lifespans are measured in minutes. A tornado of EF2 or more - winds of 111 to 165 miles per hour - can destroy a structure in four seconds. But only one in four tornadoes have wind speeds at 110 miles per hour or greater, the threshold of a major hurricane.\n\nHurricanes can be hundreds of miles wide and can plow across thousands of miles for days before they fizzle out. That means even minor inconveniences such as power outages often cover a vastly larger area. Wilma in 2005 knocked out power for weeks for 6 million households from Orlando south to Florida's tip.\n\n## Levels Of Damage\n\nResponders must then face a sea of people who, while minimally affected, want immediate help.\n\n\"That means the importance of being self-sufficient for three to five days,\" said Bill Johnson, Palm Beach County's emergency manager.\n\nTornadoes pack powerful winds, and the varying effects of those winds are staggering.\n\nDamage at 111 miles per hour is 21 times what it would be at 75 mph, a minimum-strength hurricane, according to a chart prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAt 155 miles per hour the damage is multiplied by 333. At 190 mph, it's multiplied 1,696 times. Last week's tornado in Oklahoma topped that level, if only for seconds.\n\nWhile tornadoes can do vast damage in a short time, hurricanes have an arsenal of ways to damage lives and property.\n\n## Devastating Winds\n\nHurricane winds can range to a top-end of 155 miles per hour and can last for hours. As a result, they usually cause more property damage than deaths.\n\nThe strongest winds of Hurricane Frances stayed in the Treasure Coast, on Florida's Atlantic coast, with only a tiny corner of Palm Beach County experiencing hurricane-force gusts. But the storm pounded that area for two days, and those hours of wind did as much damage as a stronger, shorter storm.\n\nAndrew, one of only three Category 5 storms to strike the U.S. mainland, had top sustained winds of 165 miles per hour. As many as 500,000 people felt hurricane-force winds. Because people took precautions, only 15 died in South Florida. Category 5 is the strongest hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale.\n\n## Sheets Of Rain\n\nA slow-moving hurricane can produce considerably more rainfall than a swifter, stronger one. Andrew's rainfall topped out at 8 inches. Isaac was hundreds of miles out in the Gulf of Mexico last year when one of its outermost bands dropped as much as 17 inches of rain on parts of Palm Beach County. Twisters can be associated with heavy rain, but don't directly figure into rainfall or flooding.\n\nA storm surge is what forecasters consider a hurricane's most treacherous aspect. It features a rising tide, aided by the hammering of breaking waves, that can start hours before the storm itself hits. The surge can flood buildings and drown people miles inland.\n\n## Tornadoes Born Of Hurricanes\n\nHurricanes can spawn tornadoes. Twisters typically form on the outer edges of hurricanes, especially in or ahead of the storm's most powerful part - its front right section.\n\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert's eye passed into Mexico but spawned 41 tornadoes in Texas. Several hit San Antonio, about 350 miles from Gilbert's landfall.\n\nAnd small storms can produce tornadoes as often as large ones. In 2008, Fay, only a tropical storm, spun off a tornado in Florida's Wellington area that all but flattened a horse center.\n\nBut a high-end tornado might not create as much damage if it touched down on South Florida.\n\n\"In Florida, the homes are built to be wind resistant, and in the Midwest, less so,\" said Remington Brown, senior engineering manager for the Tampa-based Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety.\n\nWhile buildings in Florida would be built to withstand winds of up to 140 miles per hour, those in the Midwest might be built for 90 mph, Brown said.\n\nEngineers and emergency managers are not shy about the value of window coverings. Once the envelope around a home is compromised, a hurricane is pressing on a structure from both inside and outside. Brown says while coverings would be of little value in a high-end tornado, and residents wouldn't have time to attach them anyway, they'll protect that envelope through hours of hurricane winds. Walls, windows and insulation, which are considered a house's envelope, separate the outside from the inside.\n\nAfter Andrew, Florida's building codes were overhauled and are now among the nation's best. In the Midwest, people might be unable to justify the added costs against the limited potential damage from a tornado, Brown said. Still, tornadoes are so short-lived that most Midwesterners never will experience one, he added.'"

            "text": "\tSANTA CRUZ ISLAND, Calif. - Archaeologist Torben Rick watched with frustration as pounding surf clawed at one of the first places where people once lived in North America. The area was a massive heap of village foundations, cutting tools, beads and kitchen discards left behind over the last 13,000 years.\n\nHere, seafaring tribal members cast fishing nets from canoes made of redwood planks. They prepared dinners on stone griddles and painstakingly chipped out tiny shell beads prized as currency.\n\nBut unless something is done, this rich trove of Native American history and several others on the island will almost certainly be destroyed. Rising seas and strong storm surges are destroying many of the beaches where the artifacts are found.\n\nRick, curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, picked up a tiny pink bead.\n\n\"Things like this are golden because they can help us better understand the people who lived here and how they dealt with some of the same unstoppable forces we face today,\" he said. \"The trouble is, a few more storms and all this valuable history will be washed out to sea.\"\n\n## An Archaeological Accounting\n\nConservationists and archaeologists are fighting back. Half a dozen scientists armed with trowels, clipboards and global positioning devices fanned out across the island's headlands and rocky fingers earlier this month. They took the first full accounting of archaeological sites heavily threatened by shoreline retreat and storm erosion.\n\nThe site inventory will create baseline information to help guide conservation decisions at imperiled sites where there's a shared history between humans and the ecosystem. It will also enable scientists to monitor the destructive forces of marine erosion, which are predicted to get worse.\n\nThe archaeological assessment is a combined effort by the Smithsonian Institution, the University of Oregon, Chumash tribal leaders and the Nature Conservancy. The Conservancy manages 76 percent of the 96-square-mile island, the largest of eight Channel Islands, 36 miles off Ventura, California.\n\n\"The real tragedy, and the urgency, is that sea level rise is destroying wholesale the opportunity to learn about our past - information we can use to be better conservationists,\" said Scott Morrison, the Conservancy's director of conservation science. \"We're trying to do something about that.\"\n\nDozens of sites, including former villages and workshops, were assigned one of five risk categories. Factors such as elevation, distance to the nearest shoreline, coastal slope, soil erosion and precipitation rates were considered.\n\n## Emergency Rescue At A Cave\n\nEight sites were designated \"code red.\" Those sites contain significant archaeological resources and are in danger of being destroyed by rising seas in the near term.\n\nAmong them is a remote cave where the team conducted an \"emergency archaeological rescue\" of artifacts entombed beneath thick layers of sand and driftwood: arrowheads, crude stone implements, rope and fabric woven out of sea grass.\n\nAlso recovered in the cave was a square piece of redwood smeared with brown tar. The piece was used to repair a hole in a canoe.\n\n\"The last time one of these planks was found was in the 1960s,\" said Jon M. Erlandson, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon. Erlandson is an expert on Santa Cruz Island's cultural resources.\n\nThe plank is a reminder of a time when the coast teemed with fish, waterfowl and shellfish. \"The shoreline was a lot further away than it is now,\" Erlandson said.\n\n\"There's not enough time to save everything,\" he added. \"We're trying to record and salvage all we can before it's too late.\"\n\n## From The Time Of Pygmy Mammoths\n\nAt a site near the cave, at least three Chumash house pits discovered within the last 40 years have been destroyed by the ocean.\n\nThe destruction eliminated the possibility of running DNA analysis and chemical studies of the remains. Such studies could provide important information about changes in island culture and the landscape, Erlandson said.\n\nRising sea levels between 7,000 and 15,000 years ago submerged much of the evidence of the island's earliest occupants. Those people were seafarers who arrived when pygmy mammoths lumbered through inland forests at the end of the last ice age.\n\nTheir descendants flourished amid the rich marine environment. In 1542, explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo counted several densely populated villages as he sailed past, and there were many more he didn't see.\n\nThe island is relatively large and has a diverse, roadless terrain. There are plunging valleys, conifer forests, steep mountains and windswept beaches. The size and terrain made it hard to survey evidence of the past inhabitants over the centuries.\n\nAfter wiggling along a rocky road for two hours, Rick brought his four-wheel drive truck to an abrupt stop. \"Let's go for a walk,\" he said.\n\nHe was joined by Gil Unzueta, a Chumash Indian monitoring the survey effort. Moments later, they were striding toward the eroding remnants of an ancient settlement and refuse heap that was falling into the sea.\n\n\"We're standing on a living history book,\" Unzueta said. \"And we're losing pages from it every day.\"'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE- Jim Chatters kept a low profile after the bruising battle over a skeleton he studied died down.\n\nAs the first scientist to study the skeleton known as Kennewick Man, unearthed in eastern Washington almost two decades ago, Chatters was caught in a controversy over race and cultural identity stirred up by the 9,500-year-old bones. His assertion that the mystery man didn't look anything like modern Native Americans infuriated Northwest Tribes, who consider the remains to be those of an ancestor. They sued for the right to rebury what they call the Ancient One.\n\nNow the archaeologist is back in the spotlight with another set of prehistoric bones, along with DNA evidence that helps resolve a long-standing puzzle about the first Americans. The findings also suggest - but don't prove - that the tribes may have been right about Kennewick Man all along.\n\nThe new discovery comes from a spectacular underwater cave on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Divers came across a trove of prehistoric animal bones and one of the oldest, most complete human skeletons in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n## The Paleo-Americans\n\nIn Thursday's issue of the journal Science, Chatters and an international team of 15 experts report that the human remains are those of a teenage girl. She apparently took a fatal tumble into the limestone cavern between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago, before slowly rising seas engulfed the formation.\n\nThe divers who found the skeleton named her \"Naia,\" Greek for water nymph.\n\nThe young woman's skeleton shares many of the physical traits that led Chatters to question Kennewick Man's relationship to modern Native Americans. \"Even though she is extremely feminine looking and he is very masculine, they look a lot alike,\" he said.\n\nBoth skeletons have narrow brain cases, short faces and prominent foreheads typical of people from the Pacific Rim, Australia and Africa.\n\n[Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) more closely resemble people from northeast Asia. That jibes with genetic studies documenting their descent from Siberians believed to have migrated east into the land mass that once linked Asia and Alaska. From there, they are believed to have expanded into the Americas beginning about 17,000 years ago.\n\nTo explain why the bones of the Western Hemisphere's oldest inhabitants - called Paleo-Americans - have such an unexpected appearance, Chatters and other scientists hypothesized that the Americas were colonized twice in prehistoric times. First by people from Southeast Asia or even Europe, then by migrants from Siberia.\n\n## A Clear Link Shown\n\nBut DNA extracted from Naia's teeth changed his mind.\n\nGenetic analyses conducted at Washington State University and other labs show a clear link between the girl in the cave and modern Native Americans.\n\nThe study is the first to show that there is at least one Paleo-American who is descended from the same ancestors as modern Native Americans, said WSU anthropologist Brian Kemp.\n\nThat means the physical differences must be due to evolution, as the earliest human occupants adapted to their new environments in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"For nearly 20 years, since Kennewick Man turned up, I've been wondering why these early people looked so different from Native Americans,\" Chatters said. \"This is one step toward resolving that issue.\"\n\nThe study supports the traditional view that most of the people who colonized the Americas had their roots in northeast Asia, said anthropologist James Dixon.\n\n\"It's a very sound piece of work, and it makes a lot of sense,\" he said. \"All the DNA evidence we have on these early skeletons - which is very meager - points to the northeast Asian origin,\" he said.\n\nBut that doesn't rule out the possibility of colonists from other parts of the world, he added.\n\n## An Underwater Study\n\nDNA has only been extracted from four sets of human remains in the Western Hemisphere that are older than 10,000 years. Naia's skeleton, which includes all the major bones and a full set of teeth, is the most complete.\n\nAlberto Nava, one of the divers who discovered the skeleton in 2007, said he and his team swam through a mile-long tunnel before reaching a chamber the size of a basketball arena. They named it \"Hoyo Negro,\" or Black Hole. It was so vast their underwater lights barely penetrated the darkness.\n\nHeaps of bones on the chamber floor, nearly 150 feet below sea level, were identified later as those of sabertooth cats, elephant-like creatures called gomphotheres and giant sloths. Naia's bones were lying on a small ledge.\n\nThe girl probably fell through a sinkhole into the chamber, which at that time was above sea level, Chatters said. Her pelvis was broken. \"I think she died almost instantly, if not instantly,\" he said.\n\nOver the past three years, Chatters worked with divers and Mexican scientists to study her skeleton. Because the bones are fragile and their position in the cave is important to piecing together the scientific puzzle, much of the analysis was conducted underwater by professional divers.\n\n## What About Kennewick Man?\n\nThe researchers estimated that the cave was flooded about 10,000 years ago. That's when the last ice age came to an end and melting glaciers raised sea levels around the world.\n\nNaia's third molar was shipped to Kemp's lab at WSU for DNA extraction. He didn't think it was going to work because the tooth was in such bad shape. But he was wrong.\n\n\"I was surprised at how easy it was,\" he said.\n\nKemp enlisted colleagues at two other universities to verify the results.\n\nIn the first pass, the scientists only sequenced a tiny fraction of girl's genome located in cell structures called mitochondria, which are passed down from mother to child. But they hope to extend their analysis soon, Kemp said.\n\nThe new study didn't deal directly with Kennewick Man. But the findings raise questions about the fate of the skeleton that remains locked away at the University of Washington's Burke Museum.'"

            "title": "President rejects Keystone XL oil pipeline because of climate risk",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - President Barack Obama announced Friday that he was rejecting the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline project. The project was conceived as a way to bring large quantities of Canadian crude oil into the United States. It has been a controversial idea because the oil the pipeline would deliver is extracted from tar sands. Many people believe the methods of extracting the oil from the sand are highly damaging to the environment and that in any case, the United States should be moving away from its dependence on oil.\n\nObama said the project would not serve U.S. interests. He dismissed the pipeline's potential benefits in creating jobs and helping the overall economy as insignificant in the long run.\n\nThe president said he hoped his decision would close a long-running chapter in the political fight over global warming.\n\n\"For years, the Keystone pipeline has occupied what I frankly consider an overinflated role\" in U.S. politics, Obama told reporters at the White House. \"It became a symbol too often used as a campaign cudgel by both parties rather than a serious policy matter.\"\n\n## Pipeline Became A Political Symbol\n\nThe pipeline project was conceived nearly a decade ago. Its goal was to carry more than 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Canada to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, a shortcut intended to bring it to market more quickly. Over time, however, it grew into a political symbol: for opponents, of energy interests run amok, and for backers, of the overreach of environmental advocates.\n\nOpponents have long warned about the negative effects of tar sands oil mining on wildlife and people. Construction of the pipeline would lock the United States into dependence on an oil that is destructive and hard to extract, foes said.\n\nSupporters, meanwhile, argued in favor of the economic benefits. They pointed to the jobs the construction of the pipeline would create as well as to the stream of North American oil as an important alternative to oil from the Middle East. However, a State Department study found that the pipeline would create only about 35 permanent jobs after construction was complete.\n\nIn addition, fluctuating oil prices affect the economics of tar sands oil, which is difficult and costly to extract. At various times over the past year, the price of oil dropped below the point that would allow Keystone investors to make any profit.\n\n## Keystone's Significance Obscured By The Debate\n\nThe years of fighting obscured the fact that Keystone was perhaps not as significant as it was made out to be. The pipeline, Obama said, would \"neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others.\"\n\nThe president's announcement came days after TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, asked that its permit application be put on hold while a legal challenge to the project played out in Nebraska. It had become increasingly clear in recent months that Obama would probably reject the pipeline. TransCanada's request was widely seen as a way to buy time until a possibly friendlier new president moved into the White House after the 2016 elections.\n\nEnvironmentalists \"are well aware that the next president could undo all this, but this is a day of celebration,\" said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the environmental group 350.org.\n\nEven as he dismissed the project's potential impact, Obama still argued that rejecting it makes an important statement about the U.S. commitment to fighting climate change. Scientists say fossil fuels like oil are the major cause of global warming. As a result, many environmental activists support a switch to cleaner sources of energy.\n\n\"We are continuing to lead by example,\" Obama said. If world leaders are going to protect the environment, he said, \"we're going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them.\"\n\n## Decision Was Considered At Highest Levels\n\nA major international climate summit will be taking place in Paris next month. Obama and other world leaders are expected to agree on significant new efforts to curb global warming during that meeting. Such efforts would seemingly have to involve reductions in fossil fuel use.\n\n\"America,\" the president said, \"is going to hold ourselves to the same high standards to which we hold the rest of the world.\"\n\nBecause the pipeline would cross a U.S. border, State Department officials were in charge of the review of the project. For months, the agency had been gathering comments from the public. However, the project had become so highly politicized that the decision about whether to clear or derail it was under consideration at the highest levels of the Obama administration.\n\nObama said he explained his decision earlier Friday to Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister. Trudeau supports the pipeline but pledges oversight of its environmental impact.\n\n## A Wide Range Of Reactions\n\nObama's decision swiftly drew a wide range of reactions. Leading environmentalists pointed to the effectiveness of the opposition they organized.\n\n\"The power of the American people decisively beat out the fossil fuel special interests,\" said Tom Steyer, a California billionaire. Steyer has poured tens of millions of dollars into fighting climate change. \"The D.C. establishment once called this pipeline a done deal, but a movement emerged that refused to accept\" such an outcome.\n\nPipeline backers and political opponents said Obama gave in to the wishes of environmentalists.\n\n\"Obama today demonstrated that he cares more about kowtowing to green-collar elitists than he does about creating desperately needed, family supporting, blue-collar jobs,\" union leader Terry O'Sullivan said. He represents the type of workers who might have built the Keystone.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, called the long wait for a decision \"troubling.\"\n\nThe president's \"approach to this process\" and his final decision reveal \"a lack of leadership when facing tough issues,\" McCarthy said.\n\n'"

            "text": "\tAn albino variety of California kingsnake that is popular as a pet has infested the Canary Islands, nearly wiping out the islands' own bird, mammal and lizard species.\n\nThe islands, which lie northwest of Africa, were once a stable ecology, but the native animals have had no time to evolve survival tactics against the snakes.\n\nWith no natural predators to keep its numbers in check, the kingsnake population has exploded, say U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) biologists helping the Spanish islands attempt to control the highly adaptive and secretive predators.\n\n\"The kingsnakes in question are from a species found in San Diego and bred in captivity,\" said Robert Fisher, a research biologist with the USGS. \"Some of their offspring wound up in the Canary Islands via the international pet trade, and then got loose.\"\n\nHe added, \"Now, their densities are going through the roof.\"\n\n## Recruiting Dogs And Hawks\n\nFisher is among three U.S. experts heading to the Canary Islands in May. They will advise scientists and government officials on the behavior and potential vulnerabilities of the snakes that first raised alarms in 2007.\n\nSince then, their populations have swelled to thousands per square mile in the eastern and northwestern portions of Gran Canaria. The 602-square-mile volcanic island has become a kingsnake haven because of its mild temperatures, moist ocean air and lush terrain teeming with prey that never learned to fear snakes.\n\nDogs and hawks have been used in organized assaults against the snakes. So far, fewer than 2,000 have been snared. Most of those were discovered slithering over the ground.\n\n\"The trouble is, these snakes spend much of their lives beneath the ground,\" said Robert Reed, an invasive species specialist with the USGS. \"So my message to people in the Canaries will be this: The fact that you're removing hundreds of visible snakes means, unfortunately, that it is likely that there are many, many thousands more out there you can't see.\"\n\nBrian Hinds, president of the California chapter of the North American Field Herping Association, is headed to Gran Canaria. He'll arrive with proposals for dealing with what he described as a \"monumental task.\" Among them: plowing up infested areas with earth movers.\n\n\"They need to strike back hard and fast,\" said Hinds, who says he has personally captured more than 3,000 California kingsnakes. \"They're not called kingsnakes for nothing.\"\n\n## Eating Everything In Sight\n\nThe Canary Islands are another example of what can happen when an invasive snake gets a foothold in an otherwise balanced ecosystem. Brown tree snakes have established themselves in the Pacific island of Guam. The Florida Everglades have been invaded by Burmese pythons. The venomous wolf snake was introduced to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.\n\nThe California kingsnake is known in scientific texts as Lampropeltis getula californiae. In the Canary Islands, the snakes are roughly 30 percent larger than their wild counterparts in Southern California.\n\n\"They are a heck of a generalist predator, so they'll be eating any lizard they can fit in their mouths,\" Reed said.\n\nCanary Island biologists fear that the snakes may be nibbling three native species of gecko, skink and giant lizard into extinction.\n\n\"The data obtained show that the California kingsnake has a high ability to adapt and its spread to all of the islands is more than likely,\" said a 2012 study funded by the European Union. The study was published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \"This snake will quite possibly impact the local reptilian population to the point where we see their total disappearance.\"\n\nCanary Island officials hope to eventually reduce their numbers by half, if possible.\n\n\"Most control programs for invasive reptiles are initiated long after the problem has gotten out of hand,\" Reed said. \"Unfortunately, this sort of thing will probably become more common as international borders fall, incomes rise and more people get interested in owning exotic pets.\"'"

            "title": "L.A. subway work burps up a bonanza of prehistoric swag",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Seventy feet below Wilshire Boulevard, subway construction crews were hard at work. Fresh air roaring from giant ventilation pipes partly covered up the sickly sweet smell of petroleum.\n\nAmid the clatter of jackhammers and the whine of a mini-excavator, paleontologist Kim Scott scouted the tarry muck for relics from a long-buried beach. She had plenty of choices in her search for remains of prehistoric life. Scott is a field and laboratory director with Cogstone Resource Management in Orange.\n\nMajor construction on the highly anticipated Westside subway extension won't begin until next year. But an exploratory shaft has already been dug at the corner of Ogden Drive to check soil conditions for future stations and tunnels. This preparatory work has already burped up a bonanza of prehistoric swag.\n\nOfficials had anticipated encountering a substantial cache: The dig is near the famed La Brea Tar Pits, where many prehistoric remains have been discovered over the years. And it features sandy soil rich with naturally occurring asphalt - a fossil haven.\n\n## \"Last Great Ice Age\"\n\nPaleontologists have recovered mollusks, asphalt-saturated sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and Monterey cypress cones. For Scott, two finds are particularly exciting: a rock embedded with what appears to be part of a sea lion's mouth, perhaps 2 million years old, and a non-fossilized 10-foot limb from a digger pine tree. That tree would look right at home today in Central California woodlands.\n\n\"The best record of life from the last great ice age in the world is found\" on this stretch of Wilshire Boulevard, said Scott.\n\nIn the shaft, she added, \"you're walking along an ice age shoreline.\"\n\nThe former Rancho La Brea area of Hancock Park and its surrounding areas indeed feature one of the world's premier paleontological troves. Over many thousands of years, petroleum from once massive underground oil fields oozed to the surface. It formed into bogs that trapped and killed unwary animals, and then preserved their skeletons.\n\nEvidence abounds at the tar pits, where right in the heart of Los Angeles scientists have uncovered remnants of dire wolves, saber-toothed cats, ground sloths and other species.\n\nThe swimming-pool-size shaft, 18 feet wide by 38 feet long, is yielding evidence from its depths of a cooler, wetter Pleistocene climate of 100,000 to 330,000 years ago. Back then, Pacific Ocean waves lapped over what is now the bustling Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard. Materials from the upper 40 feet of the shaft range from the modern era to 50,000 years old. Below that is \"near shore\" material from 100,000 to 330,000 years ago, Scott said.\n\n## A Mammoth Named Zed\n\nThis latest uncovering of prehistoric remnants follows major earlier discoveries in the same part of town. In 2006, the largest known cache of fossils from the last ice age was uncovered during the excavation for a nearby underground garage.\n\nIn one spectacular instance back then, a worker scraped his bulldozer across what turned out to be a nearly intact skeleton of a Columbian mammoth with 10-foot-long tusks. Researchers named the beast Zed.\n\nScientists were thrilled with the find, given that previous discoveries in the tar pits had included only bits and pieces of mammoths. So that construction could resume as quickly as possible, paleontologists pioneered a process similar to that used to move large living trees. After identifying the edges of each of 16 deposits, they dug around and underneath them. They then wrapped the deposits in heavy plastic, built wooden crates around them and lifted them out with a heavy crane.\n\nSimilar discoveries are expected once excavation begins for the Fairfax station, and scientists plan to use the same extraction method.\n\nThe exploratory shaft now being dug will be twice as deep as any other previous excavation in the area. At this stage, the marine finds are quite portable: geoducks, clams, snails, mussels, tusk shells. They're collected in takeout-food containers made of plastic, so that the asphalt does not stick. As for the rock that possibly contains a sea lion's tooth root, Scott explained that it probably washed out of an old formation and floated down a stream to the beach.\n\n\"Even though we're finding fossils older than what's found at La Brea, none of the identified fossils found to date are extinct,\" Scott said. \"We can still find all the plants and animals in California.\"\n\n## Working 15-Hour Days\n\nAsphalt from an earlier descent already coated Scott's jeans, work boots and right forearm when she headed back down the steep metal steps into the hole one recent afternoon. The uneven surface at the base made it tough to balance. She stepped back with one foot, which sank immediately into ankle-deep water. Above the fresh muck, wood and concrete had been installed to hold back the soil.\n\nBethany Ader, another paleontologist, scrambled up and down a slippery slope of tar sand carrying small relics. The two scientists have routinely worked 15-hour days.\n\nWork on the shaft began last April, and subway workers expect to hit 75 feet by the end of March. They will then excavate an additional 2 feet to pour a concrete slab floor.\n\nOnce the shaft is completed, it will be covered by street grating. Over the next six months, engineers will enter the shaft periodically to check for water and to determine how the soils will react during the subway tunneling and station construction.\n\nAt some point years hence, commuters will walk through the subterranean station, unaware that they're surrounded by the remnants of a distant sea.\n\nAlong this stretch of Wilshire, said subway system spokesman Dave Sotero, \"L.A.'s prehistoric past is meeting its subway future.\"'"

            "text": "\tBEIRUT, Lebanon - It took a garbage crisis for the Lebanese people to finally snap.\n\nAnger about the heaps of trash accumulating in Beirut's streets boiled over this week. Thousands protested in the street against a government so dysfunctional it can't hold elections or pick a president, much less deliver basic services.\n\nTiny Lebanon has been relatively unaffected by neighboring Syria's civil war. However, the Middle Eastern country could find itself plunging into chaos if further violence breaks out in its capital.\n\n\"It shows the Lebanese society to some extent catching up with the rest of the Arab world in terms of popular protests against the central government,\" said Rami Khouri. He is a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut.\n\n## Lingering Effects Of Civil War\n\nIn many ways, Lebanon never got over its civil war, which raged from 1975 until 1990. Governments neglected the country's infrastructure, leading to water shortages and electricity cuts even now, 25 years after the war ended.\n\nThese longstanding grievances erupted after the government closed its main landfill July 17, offering Beirut no alternative site to dump its trash. Mountains of garbage piled up on the streets, prompting a protest movement that is calling itself \"You Stink.\"\n\nDecades of putting up with an ineffective government and corrupt politicians exploded at once. The \"You Stink\" movement, a rare, non-political grassroots movement, quickly picked up supporters and expanded its demands beyond just the trash in the street: It demanded the resignation of the entire government.\n\nLebanon's government operates a power-sharing system that is supposed to ensure that Muslims and Christians are represented equally. However, the system often leads to constant arguing and favoritism among the country's politicians.\n\n## Parliament Unable To Select President\n\nLebanon has been without a president for more than a year, despite nearly 30 attempts by Parliament to pick a new one. Parliament twice has extended its term without elections, though it isn't working because some lawmakers insist on electing a president first.\n\nThe \"You Stink\" protests, which began as peaceful demonstrations, turned violent over the weekend. A small group of young men repeatedly tried to tear down a barbed-wire fence separating the crowds from the Lebanese government building, which houses the offices of the prime minister and top officials.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday night, police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters, battling them in the streets of Beirut in dramatic clashes. Gunfire could be heard, and dozens were wounded.\n\nOn Monday, workers swept up broken glass and the burned remains of the weekend's violence.\n\n\"We arrived in the morning and found everything broken, chairs on the floor, everything is a mess,\" said Joseph Khoury, who works at a car rental agency.\n\n## Protesters Blame Political Agents For Violence\n\nProtesters blamed the protest on thugs sent by politicians.\n\n\"Those who did this do not represent the Lebanese people,\" said Salah Noureddine, one of a handful of people protesting Monday morning.\n\nThe \"You Stink\" movement also says it will not back down.\n\n\"This movement has succeeded in reawakening the Lebanese, and we will not let them make us go to sleep again,\" said Marwan Maarouf, a group representative.\n\nMaarouf called for a large protest Saturday, saying that the movement's goal is \"toppling an entire corrupt political class.\" But such a move risks plunging Lebanon into an even greater instability and further straining the country, which is already flooded with Syrian war refugees.\n\nAlthough \"You Stink\" canceled a planned protest Monday, hundreds again gathered in downtown Beirut after sunset. The event was peaceful in the early evening. Large concrete barriers blocked those in Riad El Solh Square from reaching the government building.\n\n## Turmoil Likened To Arab Spring Revolts\n\nSome are already calling the huge protests of the past 2 days a revolt similar to those of the Arab Spring that overthrew dictators across the Mideast beginning in 2011.\n\nAnticipating more trouble, the Lebanese army took up positions around downtown Beirut, stationing armored vehicles on street corners.\n\nSeparately Monday, heavy clashes resumed in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh near the southern port of Sidon, Lebanon. The violence, which began on Saturday followed a failed assassination attempt targeting an official from a political party.\n\nKhouri, the analyst, said the protest, Lebanon's largest in years, likely will signal some kind of change.\n\n\"I see this potentially, if it grows, as the beginning of a serious challenge to the existing sectarian system,\" he said. \"So either ... (the government) has to change or it has to become more efficient and more equitable.\"\n\n## Minister Releases List Of Companies To Manage Trash\n\nIn an attempt to respond, Lebanese Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced the names of companies that will be hired to manage Beirut's trash. He described the hiring process as \"transparent\" and a \"significant achievement.\" The government also scheduled the next Cabinet meeting earlier, saying it will meet Tuesday to discuss the trash crisis.\n\nActivists, however, quickly dismissed those actions as political game-playing.\n\nAmerican Ambassador to Lebanon David Hale also said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the images of violence at the protests and the reports of injuries. He called for a thorough investigation and restraint on all sides.\n\nAfter meeting Prime Minister Tammam Salam, Hale said: \"Lebanon's citizens deserve to have basic services they can count upon, just as they deserve a Parliament that overcomes its divisions and elects a president.\"'"

            "title": "Leapin' lizards! And alligators and birds breathe more efficiently than you",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - It is a little-known fact that when it comes to extracting oxygen from the air we breathe, we humans are just OK.\n\nBirds and alligators are more efficient breathers than we are and so are monitor lizards, according to a new study. Scientists also think that animals that are now extinct, such as dinosaurs, were also better at breathing than people.\n\nHumans are described as tidal breathers. When we breathe in, fresh air moves into our lungs along progressively smaller and smaller airways. It eventually ends up in little sacs called alveoli, where our bloodstream picks up oxygen and deposits carbon dioxide before the \"old\" air moves out of our lungs along exactly the same path it came in.\n\nBut birds, alligators and monitor lizards are \"unidirectional\" breathers. After the air moves into their lungs, it begins to follow a system of tubes that are similar to the arteries and veins which carry blood. In this system, the air moves through the tubes in only one direction, and this is much more efficient at extracting oxygen from the air than the human way.\n\n## Getting Oxygen In Difficult Conditions\n\nScientists discovered that birds are unidirectional breathers in the first half of the 20th century in Europe. Coal was burnt to power trains, making the air in train stations extremely dirty. When researchers examined the pigeons that had been breathing the sooty air, they found the birds had just one black area on their lungs. If pigeons breathed like humans do, the scientists would have expected the entire lung to be black, not just a part of it.\n\n\"The fact that only one part of the bird lung was dark suggested the air was flowing in one direction,\" said Colleen Farmer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah. Farmer explained that the black section was the first part of the lung to receive the contaminated air and then filter the dirty particles.\n\nIt isn't that surprising that birds have developed a more efficient breathing system. Scientists believe it may have evolved to help their high metabolic rates, or their ability to convert food to energy very quickly. It could also allow them to survive when they fly at high altitudes, where oxygen is scarce. Then Professor Farmer published a study in 2010 showing that alligators are unidirectional breathers as well.\n\n\"That's when I realized it had to have a function other than supporting the high metabolic rates associated with birds,\" she said. Professor Farmer knew that cold-blooded animals spend about 80 percent of their lives holding their breath. So she worked out that this type of breathing could be important for mixing gases in the lungs during a breath-hold.\n\n## Older Than The Dinosaurs?\n\nOn Wednesday, Farmer published another study in the journal Nature that shows that monitor lizards are unidirectional breathers as well. She believes that further studies will prove that all lizards and snakes are also unidirectional breathers. \"Unidirectional breathing appears to be much more common and ancient than anyone thought,\" Farmer said in a statement.\n\nThe scientists are still not sure exactly when unidirectional breathing first developed. But if it all evolved from one ancestor rather than in many different animals at the same time, it is possible there have been unidirectional breathers walking the planet for 270 million years. This is 100 million years before the first birds and 20 million years earlier than anyone thought.\n\nIt is impossible to directly study whether extinct animals like dinosaurs were unidirectional breathers. But Farmer said that since alligators, birds and probably most lizards all breathe this way, it is likely the system was inherited from an ancestor the dinosaurs also shared.\n\nProfessor Farmer said the next step in her research is to determine just how common unidirectional breathing is in today's animals, as well as how many beasts from the past breathed in this way.\n\n\"We want to look at a bunch of lizards and snakes and turtles and amphibians,\" she said. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us.\"'"

            "title": "By cutting down forests, humans may be increasing spread of malaria",
            "text": "\tAn unusual form of malaria is spreading to people in Malaysian Borneo, and scientists say they may know why. In a new study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, scientists say that deforestation in the Southeast Asian country is to blame for the spread of the mosquito-borne illness. Cutting down trees in rain forests is causing the environment to change, and that may be increasing transmission of a form of malaria usually found only in monkeys.\n\nThe disease is caused by a parasite and spread by mosquitoes. People with malaria often experience fever, chills and flu-like illness. Some patients develop severe complications and can even die. In 2013, there were almost 200 million cases of malaria worldwide and 500,000 patients died, mostly children in Africa. Most of the cases in the United States are in travelers from countries where malaria transmission occurs, such as south of the Sahara Desert in Africa and South Asia.\n\nIn Malaysian Borneo, scientists noticed an increase in a form of malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium knowlesi. Malaria of that type is usually found in a type of monkey called macaques. In the last decade, the parasite has also become the leading cause of human malaria in the region that is also known as East Malaysia, and located on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. \n\n## Research Done On Island Of Borneo\n\nThe island of Borneo is just north of the equator and surrounded by the South China Sea on the west and the Sulu and Celebes Seas on the east. It is the third-largest island in the world, and is shared by the countries of Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. The island has a number of beaches, rain forests and national parks. \n\nScientists wanted to know what was causing the increase in human transmission of the parasite that causes this form of malaria. While it is found heavily in macaques, it is transmitted to people by mosquitoes, the same way that other forms of malaria are spread. Scientists guessed that an environmental disturbance was bringing humans and the monkeys closer together.\n\n\"That's when we started looking at deforestation,\" says scientist Kimberly Fornace. She is the study's lead author based out of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in England. Fornace says she and her team thought clearing trees in the rain forest was causing people, mosquitoes and macaques to be in closer contact.\n\n## Effects of Change Seen At Edge Of Habitat\n\nFornace and her team looked at information about malaria patients who had the disease between 2008 and 2012. It came from health clinics in Kudat and Kota Marudu, two Malaysian districts. The scientists recorded where patients came from and compared it to satellite images of deforestation happening in the same time period.\n\nThe team found that areas where many trees had been cleared in the years before an outbreak of human malaria had higher rates of infection. However, areas with more than 65 percent of their forest uncut also had high malaria rates.\n\nThe reason is known as the edge effect, when an ecosystem experiences a large amount of environmental change right at the edge of a habitat. It tends to be strongest in places where people have left parts of the ecosystem standing, but have divided it up by logging and clearing.\n\nFornace says she and her team believe that malaria is transmitted at the edges of forests, where people and macaques are coming into contact. Mosquitoes are carrying the parasite from the monkeys to humans. \n\n## Crowded Macaques Search For Food\n\nResearchers suspect that as their habitat becomes more divided, the macaques are forced to crowd into smaller areas and even leave the forest to search for food. Because the animals are closer to people, mosquitoes can more easily spread malaria.\n\nFornace says the research gives scientists an opportunity to better understand which regions are experiencing the highest rates of disease transmission. Then they can create better risk maps to help decrease infection.\n\nShe also says that human actions do not just alter the environment, they also can have an impact on human health. Policymakers should plan to use land more responsibly when it comes to public health.\n\nMargaret Kosek is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. She says, \"These findings are consistent with other studies emphasizing the importance of deforestation in the transmission of malaria.\"  Kosek also says that it is important to offer good public health care to people who live in affected areas.\n\n## Other Factors Include Health Care\n\nKosek herself has done research on malaria transmission in the Amazon rain forest in the country of Peru. She says that deforestation has been tied to malaria transmission in other parts of the world, but how much of a factor it is depends on the setting.\n\nShe says there are other things that might make the problem worse. For example, people living in places where rapid deforestation is taking place might not have access to good medical care.\n\nResearch shows that deforestation has also affected the spread of other diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, certain tick-borne illnesses and Ebola.\n\nOther research in recent years has focused on how environmental disturbances due to climate change such as warmer temperatures and poor water quality might affect the spread of disease. In addition, human populations forced to move due to conflict, disaster or development are also expected to spread disease.'"

            "text": "\tKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - The Malaysian jetliner that has been missing for more than a week was diverted from its path on purpose. A Malaysian leader said in a statement on Saturday that the plane continued flying for more than six hours after cutting off contact with the ground. Now, investigators believe that the plane could have gone as far northwest as Kazakhstan or into the southern end of the Indian Ocean.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak's statement confirmed days of rising speculation that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to Beijing was not an accident. It also refocused the investigation into the flight's 12-person crew and 227 passengers.\n\n\"Clearly the search for MH370 has entered a new phase,\" Najib said at a news conference.\n\nNajib stressed that investigators were looking into all possibilities as to why the Boeing 777 ended up so far away from its original flight path. He said authorities could not confirm whether it was a hijacking. Earlier Saturday, a Malaysian official said the plane had been hijacked, but he added that investigators hadn't found a motive and no demands had been made known.\n\n## Plane's Turn To West\n\n\"In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board,\" Najib told reporters.\n\nPolice on Saturday went to the Kuala Lumpur homes of both the pilot and co-pilot of the missing plane.\n\nExperts have previously said that whoever disabled the plane's communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience. One possibility they have raised was that one of the pilots wanted to commit suicide.\n\nThe plane departed for an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing at 12:40 a.m. on March 8. Its communications with civilian air controllers were cut off at about 1:20 a.m., and the jet disappeared. It is now one of the most puzzling mysteries in modern aviation history.\n\nChina, where many of the passengers were from, expressed irritation over what it described as Malaysia's foot-dragging in releasing information about the search.\n\nInvestigators are now fairly certain that one of the plane's communications systems - the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System - was disabled before the aircraft reached the east coast of Malaysia, Najib said. Shortly afterward, someone on board switched off the aircraft's transponder. The transponder would allow the pilot to communicate with civilian air traffic controllers.\n\nNajib confirmed that Malaysian air force defense radar picked up traces of the plane turning back to the west. It crossed over Peninsular Malaysia into the northern stretches of the Strait of Malacca. Authorities previously had said this radar data could not be verified.\n\nAlthough the aircraft was flying virtually blind to air traffic controllers at this point, onboard equipment continued to send \"pings\" to satellites.\n\n## Time Of Last Contact Changed\n\nThe prime minister said the last confirmed signal between the plane and a satellite came at 8:11 a.m. - 7 hours and 31 minutes after takeoff. This was more than five hours later than the previous time given by Malaysian authorities as the possible last contact.\n\nAirline officials have said the plane had enough fuel to fly for up to about eight hours.\n\n\"The investigations team is making further calculations which will indicate how far the aircraft may have flown after this last point of contact,\" Najib said.\n\nHe said authorities had determined that the plane's last communication with a satellite was in one of two possible arcs, or \"corridors.\" There was one near northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIf the plane took the northern route, it could have taken the plane through China, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan - which hosts U.S. military bases - and Central Asia. If it did this, it is unclear how it might have gone undetected. The region is also home to extremist Islamic groups, unstable governments and remote, sparsely populated areas.\n\nFlying south would have put the plane over the Indian Ocean. The ocean is 12,762 feet deep on average and thousands of miles from land.\n\nBritain-based aviation security expert Chris Yates thought it was highly unlikely the plane took the northern route across land in Asia. Military aircraft from those countries would have tracked the plane, he said.\n\nNajib said search efforts in the South China Sea, where the plane first lost contact, had ended.\n\n## 14 Countries Involved In Search\n\nIndian officials said navy ships supported by planes and helicopters scoured Andaman Sea islands for a third day on Saturday. Still, they had no success in finding evidence of the missing jet.\n\nTwo-thirds of the plane's passengers were Chinese, and China's government has been under pressure to give relatives firm news of the aircraft's fate.\n\nThe Chinese government's Xinhua News Agency said the Malaysian information was \"painfully belated\" - or slow. It was resulting in wasted efforts and straining the nerves of relatives, the agency added.\n\nNajib said he understood the need for families to receive information, but that his government wanted to release only fully corroborated reports. He said his country has been sharing information with international investigators, even when it meant placing \"national security concerns\" second to the search. U.S., British and Malaysian air safety investigators have been on the ground in Malaysia to assist with the investigation.\n\nIn the Chinese capital, relatives of passengers who have anxiously awaited news at a hotel near Beijing's airport said they felt deceived. They thought they should have been told about the plane's last signal earlier.\n\nMalaysian police have already said they are looking at the mental state, family life and connections of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. Both have been described as respectable, community-minded men.\n\nFourteen countries are involved in the search for the plane, using 43 ships and 58 aircraft.'"

            "text": "\tPOINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE, Calif. - The once-bustling oyster farm at the end of the dirt road looked as if it had suddenly been abandoned.\n\nDoors and windows gaped open. Wind-chapped buildings were stripped of everything that was valuable or could be resold to other oyster operators. Inside, the remains of the former oyster business cluttered mud-caked floors: a shopping cart, fishing poles, plastic gloves and office chairs.\n\nFarmers had groomed crops of oysters in the clear waters of Drakes Estero, or estuary, for decades. Now, bits of yellowed plastic foam that had broken off of a timeworn floating barge bobbed in the water.\n\nIt is what remains after a yearslong legal battle between the oyster farmer and the National Park Service, which fought to take back and restore the bay. The park service won after spending millions of dollars in lawsuits that ended at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n## Back To The Beginning\n\nThe park is now undertaking an uncommon mission. It is returning a landscape to its original state of nature. It is expensive work that must be completed before the West Coast's first marine wilderness can be unveiled to the public.\n\n\"Nature will take over, but we have to do some restoration to help it get there,\" Point Reyes National Seashore superintendent Cicely Muldoon said. \"We have to give natural processes a fighting chance.\"\n\nShe added, \"When we are finished, visitors will have a phenomenal experience.\"\n\nThe waters of the Estero will become only the second marine wilderness in the national park system, joining Alaska's Glacier Bay.\n\n## Let's Make A Fair Deal\n\nCommercial farmers have been cultivating oysters from the Estero in earnest since the 1960s. The Lunny family operated the oyster farm here under a permit from 2004 until last December.\n\nThe oyster farm's permit required the Lunny family to remove all commercial equipment from the Estero. However, the family argued that doing so would bankrupt them.\n\nThe park wanted a speedy resolution to the legal wranglings and agreed to a deal. The deal allowed the Lunnys to walk away from the facilities onshore but required the family to remove all oysters in the water.\n\nThe settlement also allowed the dozen or so former employees who live on the site to stay for at least three months while the government attempts to find housing for them, and they will receive up to 42 months of help with their rents.\n\n## An Expensive Undertaking\n\nAs crews carefully remove remnants of the farm, Point Reyes' Muldoon gushes about kayaking and snorkeling in Drakes Estero. Explorer Sir Francis Drake is believed to have made landfall in this tidal area 430 years ago.\n\nBut first, the cleanup.\n\nThe crew spent a week scraping off buildings, docks and rusty equipment where the farmers used to harvest oysters and serve snacks to tourists.\n\nThe onshore cleanup has, so far, cost $214,000, and more work remains. Crews removed 660 yards of building material and some 6,250 square feet of asphalt, amounting to about 40 truckloads of rubble.\n\nThe expense of restoring the Estero itself will also be significant. Officials expect it will take up to a year and cost more than twice the amount of the work done on land.\n\n## Quite A Haul\n\nBefore removing the 5 miles of oyster racks, a group representing federal, state and local agencies will have to agree on a plan that ensures no harm to plants or animals.\n\nMuch of that planning will fall to Ben Becker, Point Reyes' lead marine scientist. He recently launched a small boat into the wind-chopped bay and slowly motored away from the fog-shrouded rolling hills of the seashore.\n\nBecker was trailing an underwater camera that will help him and the other scientists figure out how to wrench out an extensive network of oyster racks held up by some 4,700 wooden posts sunk into the Estero's sandy bottom.\n\nThe weight of the water-logged wood is estimated at 375 tons, and lifting it out will likely require a powerful hoist.\n\nAlready a crew on the water was removing the remains of the oyster and clam operation. In one week, workers hauled away 15 tons of oysters, shells, tubes, strings and bags.\n\n\"I didn't think there would be as much material left out here as we've found,\" Becker said, watching the crew haul out hundreds of oyster bags. The bags hit the deck of a floating barge, each one releasing a wriggling tangle of eels, followed by a platoon of tiny marching crabs.\n\n## Anticipating Seals\n\nThe Estero's 2,500 acres are a natural refuge for seals, which are believed to have moved to other areas to avoid the oyster farm's regular motorboat traffic.\n\nWildlife biologist David Press said that he does not expect the seal population to increase immediately, but they might eventually come back to the Estero.\n\nThe National Park Service sees this recovery as a case study for future marine wilderness areas, said Erin Drake, who works for the park service's National Wilderness Stewardship Program.\n\n\"We will be learning on the fly and looking at what others do,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tLong ago, there might have been a lot more water on Mars than people had thought.\n\nNASA's Curiosity rover has discovered evidence of a huge lake in Gale Crater that could have lasted millions of years. These findings may contradict the idea that much of the planet's water reserves were held only in ice or underground, and made only brief appearances on the surface.\n\nThe new results come from studying rocks at the base of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-high mound in the middle of Gale Crater. They suggest that there was a lake that filled and drained over tens of millions of years. The lake could have spanned the 96-mile-wide crater, said scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge, California. And the mud deposited in this lake could be what helped form Mount Sharp in the first place.\n\n## Pieces Of A Puzzle\n\n\"The puzzle pieces are coming together,\" Michael Meyer, lead scientist for the U.S. space agency's Mars Exploration Program, said in a press briefing.\n\nThe findings are from the Curiosity rover, known formally as the Mars Science Laboratory. They show that water could have lasted long enough for microbial life potentially to emerge, the scientists said.\n\nThe results could also affect other theories of Martian planetary evolution. After all, if these lakes were able to survive for so long, then Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere in order to protect that water from escaping into space.\n\n\"The climate system must have been loaded with water,\" Ashwin Vasavada said. \"To sustain a lake at Gale Crater for millions of years, Mars would need a vigorous hydrological cycle to keep the atmosphere humid.\" Vasavada is Curiosity's deputy project scientist.\n\nThe problem is, it's very difficult to generate a realistic model of Martian atmospheric change. It would have to explain how it could have been warm enough, not just thick enough, Vasavada said.\n\n## Was There Life On Mars?\n\nThe researchers looked at rocks that seemed to be forming at strange angles. Those are the kind of rocks you get when fast-moving river water suddenly hits a lake and has to slow down. Curiosity spotted these rocks at many different elevations. That means this cycle probably happened many times through the crater's history, said Curiosity scientist Sanjeev Gupta.\n\n\"We believe what we're seeing is multiple cycles of delta migration interspersed between river deposits and probably desert dune deposits, creating quite a complex collage of ancient environments,\" Gupta said.\n\nCuriosity is in its third year of exploration on the Red Planet. Originally sent to study Mount Sharp, the $2.5 billion laboratory-on-wheels landed in August 2012 and took a detour from its looming target to study a spot called Yellowknife Bay. There, the rover drilled up rocks that revealed signs of a past, water-rich environment on Mars that might have been able to sustain life.\n\nNow, the rover is finally studying the base of Mount Sharp, whose sedimentary layers could hold the key to whether Mars was a much more livable planet than it appears today.'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - Search and rescue teams looking of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane have found no signs of the airliner - only garbage.\n\nThe teams have discovered what oceanographers have been warning - that even the most far-flung stretches of ocean are full of trash.\n\nFor the first time since the search focused on the southern Indian Ocean 10 days ago, the skies were clear and the sea was calm. The good weather has allowed ships working off the west coast of Australia to retrieve the \"suspicious items\" spotted by planes and on satellite pictures.\n\nBut none of the items proved to be debris from the missing plane. They were just the ordinary garbage that swirls around the ocean.\n\n## Another Lost Flight Recalled\n\n\"A number of objects were retrieved by HMAS Success and Haixun 01 yesterday,\" reported the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in a statement Sunday. The objects were described as fishing equipment and other garbage.\n\nThe disappointing results demonstrated the difficulty of trying to find out what happened to the Boeing 777. Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappeared March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. A total of 239 passengers and crew were on board.\n\nAustralian authorities said Sunday that a naval support ship, the Ocean Shield, will depart from Perth on Monday with a \"black box detector\" supplied by the U.S. Navy. The detector is called a Towed Pinger Locator 25. It carries a device that should be able to detect the plane's black boxes in waters as deep as 20,000 feet. The boxes record pilots' conversations and flight data.\n\nThe search team is in a race against time because the black box's battery lasts only 30 to 45 days. The odds are stacked against finding it in time without a trail of debris to guide them. Based on an analysis of the flight's path, investigators guess the flight crashed into the Indian Ocean. The information comes from plane engine data transmitted via satellite.\n\nThe most famous example of a missing plane is Air France Flight 447. The Air France plane crashed over the Atlantic on a flight from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Paris in 2009. It took two years to find the body of the aircraft and the flight recorder, even though pieces of debris were found within five days.\n\n## \"Needle In A Garbage Patch\"\n\nThe southern Indian Ocean is one of the most remote places on the planet, far from any islands, shipping lanes or flight paths. But the area accumulates a surprisingly large amount of garbage, trapped in the spiral of slowly rotating currents.\n\n\"In addition to foul weather, administrative bungling and the vastness of the search area, the search for MH370 has been compounded by one other factor: the incredible amount of garbage already floating in the search area - and in oceans worldwide,\" Marc Lallanilla wrote on the website livescience.com. Lallanilla, a science and environmental consultant and writer, called the search for Flight 370 a \"needle in a garbage patch.\"\n\nThe lack of debris has prevented families from achieving any kind of closure over the deaths of their relatives. Chinese families, in particular, have rejected the statement of the Malaysian government that the plane crashed with no survivors.\n\n\"We want evidence, truth and dignity,\" read banners that Chinese relatives held at a demonstration at a Kuala Lumpur hotel on Sunday.\n\nMalaysia Airlines said Sunday that it will fly families of passengers to Perth and will set up a family assistance center to provide counseling and logistical support. But the airline said it will do so only when confirmed wreckage from the missing flight has been found.'"

            "title": "Germ of an idea: Experts use bacteria to fight mosquito-borne illness",
            "text": "\tLos Angeles, California residents are dealing with a foreign breed of troublesome mosquitoes. Now scientists may have found a way to bite back. These particular mosquitoes, Aedes Albopictus, also known as Asian tiger mosquitoes, arrived in shipments of bamboo from China and spread across the state over the past four years, cropping up in Los Angeles neighborhoods. Unlike other mosquitoes in California, they can carry viruses that cause the diseases dengue and chikungunya. Both cause severe pain in the joints and muscles, as well as fever.\n\nStephen Dobson, a professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, is working to get rid of the problem mosquitoes. Recently, Dobson proposed a plan to the greater Los Angeles County and San Gabriel Valley areas. He will release thousands of new mosquitoes into backyards, which local officials hope will stop further reproduction of their kind. The test bugs will all be male, which do not bite humans as female mosquitoes do. Residents were told the method should help reduce pesticide use and their mosquito population at the same time.\n\n## The Eggs Won't Hatch\n\nThe mosquitoes to be released are not genetically modified. They are males raised in a laboratory and infected with Wolbachia, a natural bacteria that effectively sterilizes them. When the males are released into people's backyards and mate with wild females, the eggs they make will not hatch, leading to fewer mosquitoes. Dobson believes that because the Asian Tiger mosquitoes are still new to California, they can be controlled.\n\nHow Wolbachia works in mosquitoes is a bit complex. If a male mosquito with Wolbachia mates with an uninfected female, then their eggs will not hatch. Scientists do not yet completely understand the reason that the eggs do not hatch. However, if two mosquitoes that both have Wolbachia mate, then their eggs will hatch as normal, although the offspring will potentially carry Wolbachia. If an infected female mates with an uninfected male, then their eggs will also hatch, although again, the offspring could be infected.\n\nAlthough certain strains of Wolbachia are already common in many species of mosquitoes, the type of the bacteria that Dobson is using does not naturally show up in Asian Tiger Mosquitoes. Scientists had to artificially infect them with the bacteria.\n\n## 10,000 Mosquitoes Per Acre\n\nAnother problem is that mosquitoes only live for a few weeks in the wild. Dobson's team must release about 10,000 male mosquitoes per acre of land every week, and repeat the process over several months.\n\nDobson chose Wolbachia when he first piloted mosquito releases last year in Lexington, Kentucky. The project had permission from local regulators and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the government agency in charge of protecting the environment.\n\nAnother government agency, the National Institutes of Health, has provided about $1 million for Wolbachia and other mosquito control projects. Dobson's team is using the funds to test the Wolbachia approach again in Lexington, as well as the Los Angeles area and Fire Island, New York.\n\n## Reducing Pesticide Use\n\nTom Iwanejko is an environmental analyst at the Suffolk County Department of Public Works, which oversees Fire Island. Iwanejko says, \"We didn't see much resistance to this plan. The community has been receptive to normal methods of mosquito control including using larvicide and spraying of adults for years. We all agree reducing pesticide use would be beneficial.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Wolbachia has been used as a way to hamper the spread of disease by mosquitoes. Scientists have previously used a strain of the bacteria to curb the spread of dengue. However, this is the first time that it has been tried in the U.S.\n\nScott O'Neill is dean of science at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and head of an international Wolbachia research group called Eliminate Dengue. O'Neill has been releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in Australia as well as the countries of Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil for the past four years.\n\nO'Neill is not trying to wipe out the mosquito population, a different goal than that of Dobson. A biological quirk of the bacteria is that it limits mosquitoes' ability to pass on dengue, so instead of just males, O'Neill releases both male and female mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia. When they mate, the eggs that they produce will hatch and carry the bacteria. His hope is to establish the bacteria among many generations of mosquitoes in the wild so that they will not die out, they will just not be able to pass on disease with their bite.\n\n## Aiming At Disease Carriers\n\nDobson, however, says he does not want Wolbachia to become established in the U.S., he just wants to control the mosquito population without pesticide. A major reason O'Neill and others are not doing the same, is because covering large amounts of land would require raising and releasing a huge number of the insects.\n\nWiping out one species of mosquito also means that others could potentially fill that gap. In an area like Los Angeles County where there were not any mosquitoes that carry dengue or chikungunya until recently, Dobson says it makes sense to try to target this disease-carrying population, and not worry about competing mosquitoes.\n\n\"We can't control mosquitoes with a single approach, and this is a new way with great potential,\" says Stephen Higgs, a Kansas State University disease expert. When asked if it could be used more widely he says money needs to be considered, and it should be proved that the costs \"per release could decline at a large scale.\"\n\nDobson and his team are hoping to have gathered enough data by early next year to know if his approach will work on a larger scale. For now, health officials in test areas like Los Angeles are just hoping to knock out their own mosquito populations.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - John Muir is a larger-than-life figure. He's the godfather of environmentalism, whose writings of spiritual enlightenment reached during solo treks in California's wilderness saved Yosemite and helped establish the national park system.\n\nAs the first president of the Sierra Club, Muir shaped ideas about how the wild world should be protected and managed.\n\nBut now some critics are arguing that the world has changed so much in the century since his death that Muir is no longer meaningful.\n\n\"Muir's legacy has to go,\" said Jon Christensen, a historian with UCLA's Institute of Environment and Sustainability. \"It's just not useful anymore.\"\n\n## A Century Of Conservation\n\nChristensen and others see Muir's beliefs as outdated in the face of 21st-century environmental challenges. The bushy-bearded Scot could not have imagined population growth, city sprawl and climate change.\n\nThe debate boils down to Muir's primary ethic: The wilderness is a temple to be left undisturbed, so people occasionally can experience nature in its purity. That idea helped shape a century of conservation. It ensured that there would be unspoiled wilderness for succeeding generations.\n\n\"He had a huge passion for nature, such as we should all cherish in our hearts,\" said Mary Ellen Hannibal, an author and Muir devotee. \"He holds up an ideal of experiencing nature firsthand in a spiritual, transcendent way.\"\n\n\"Environmentalism, in some ways, has moved beyond John Muir,\" said Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \"But he was a good guy. He was at the forefront of the notion of setting aside portions of pristine nature and letting natural forces in them move forward unimpeded.\"\n\nTo Christensen and others, however, Muir's notions give the wrong idea. Immersing people in \"universities of the wilderness\" - such as Yosemite - sends the message that only awe-inspiring parks are worth saving, at the expense of smaller city spaces.\n\nCritics also say Muir's vision of wilderness is rooted in luxury and assumes that everyone will have the abundant leisure time of the upper class to go visit nature up close.\n\n## Struggling To Connect\n\nRather than seeing Muir's beloved Sierra Mountains as backpackers, skiers or rock climbers, critics argue, Californians would benefit more from the creation of city parks and additional roads and trails in wild lands.\n\nNature exists in many forms, they say. Untouched wilderness is only one.\n\nCritics see a connection between the emotional, biblical language of Muir's writings and who makes up both national park visitors and the ranks of the largest environmental organizations - mainly aging, white Americans.\n\nThe Sierra Club, which Muir founded, is struggling to connect with California's diverse population, particularly Latinos, despite polls showing Latinos as among the most devoted environmentalists in the state. A strong and diverse Sierra Club membership in California, where Latinos are expected to become a majority by 2050, is important to influencing political decisions and raising funds to support conservation and environmental education.\n\nYet \"the conservation movement reflects the legacy of John Muir, and its influence on a certain demographic - older and white - and that's a problem,\" Christensen said.\n\n## \"We Have To Reimagine\"\n\nHe is joined in that view by D.J. Waldie, an author and expert on Southern California culture.\n\n\"We have to reimagine our relationships with nature to accommodate modern, increasingly diverse communities that see the world differently than white Anglo-Saxon Protestants like Muir did in the late 19th century,\" Waldie said.\n\n\"For many communities of color, nature of great significance isn't out there in distant charismatic Sierra peaks; it's in urban parks, in local mountains and along local rivers - and under their fingertips in the stuff they grow in their own backyards,\" he said.\n\nOne blemish on Muir's past is indisputable: His disdain for California's Native Americans, a group he claimed had no place in the Sierra landscape.\n\nLaura Pulido, a professor in USC's Department of American Studies and Ethnicity, said Muir's prejudice should be understood as part of his time.\n\n\"It is essential that we try to understand John Muir in all his complexity,\" Pulido said. \"He was a man of his times, who actively worked to disgrace California Indians by taking their lands.\"\n\nShe added, \"But he also launched the environmental movement, which is no small thing.\"\n\nIn Hannibal's view, \"What counts is the number of acres protected.\"'"

However, an estimated 6,000 Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar remain trapped at sea in crowded, wooden boats, officials and activists say. With food and clean water running low, some could be in real danger.\n\nOne vessel that reached Indonesian waters early Monday was stopped by the navy and given food, water and directions to Malaysia. Navy spokesman First Adm. Manahan Simorangkir said the fishing vessel was in good condition and the people on board looked fine, but cramped.\n\nWorried that boats will start washing to shore with dead bodies on them, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the United States and several other foreign governments and international organizations have held emergency meetings. However, participants say there are no immediate plans to search for vessels in the busy Malacca Strait.\n\n## Countries Wary Of Accepting Immigrants\n\nOne of the concerns is what to do with the Rohingya if a rescue is launched. The minority group is denied citizenship in Myanmar, and other countries have long worried that opening their doors to a few would result in an unstoppable flow of poor, uneducated migrants.\n\n\"These are people in desperate straits,\" said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch, calling on governments to band together to help those still stranded at sea, some for two months or longer. \"Time is not on their side.\"\n\nAs Muslims, the Rohingya have for decades suffered from state-sanctioned discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. The government of Myanmar considers them illegal settlers from Bangladesh, even though their families have lived in Myanmar for generations.\n\n## Religious Minority Has Been Under Attack\n\nAttacks on members of the religious minority, which numbers around 1.3 million, have in the last three years left up to 280 people dead and forced 140,000 others from their homes. Many of the displaced now live in crowded camps just outside the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, where they are given little access to schools or adequate health care. For all Rohingya in Myanmar, job opportunities are scarce.\n\nSuch conditions have sparked one of the biggest waves of boat people - refugees leaving by sea - since the Vietnam War.\n\nChris Lewa is director of the nonprofit Arakan Project, which has been monitoring boat departures and arrivals for more than a decade. She estimates that more than 100,000 men, women and children have boarded ships since mid-2012.\n\n## Region Sees Crackdown On Trafficking\n\nMost are trying to reach Malaysia, but recent regional crackdowns on human trafficking networks have sent brokers and agents into hiding. Their absence has made it impossible for migrants to disembark - in some cases even after family members have paid $2,000 or more for their release.\n\nLewa believes up to 7,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshis are still on small and large boats in the Malacca Strait and nearby international waters.'"

            "text": "\tThe divers called her Naia, for \"water nymph,\" because they discovered her teenage remains in a dark, underwater cave.\n\nShe had been hidden there, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, for more than 12,000 years - along with the bones of dozens of extinct ice age beasts. Divers quickly spotted her skull as they swept the chamber with flashlights.\n\n\"It was a small cranium laying upside-down with a perfect set of teeth and dark eye sockets looking back at us,\" recalled diver Alberto Nava.\n\nOn Thursday, researchers published a formal analysis of Naia's skeletal remains in the journal Science. They called it the oldest, most complete specimen ever discovered in the Americas.\n\nThe study authors say that the buck-toothed 15- or 16-year-old girl did not resemble today's [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) - her cheeks were narrow and her forehead very high. However, her mitochondrial DNA reveals she is related to 11 percent of living American Indians.\n\n## Related To Native Americans\n\nThat connection in turn helps prove something else: that Native Americans are linked genetically to a population of early humans who inhabited a land now submerged beneath the Bering Sea.\n\nThe researchers say the girl was probably very slight and stood just 4 feet, 10 inches tall. Her eyes were wide-set and low, and her nose was broad.\n\nCarbon-dating of her teeth and isotope data from crystals that formed on her bones show that the girl lived 12,000 to 13,000 years ago. Researchers believe she was searching for water when she entered a dark, underground cave and then plummeted 100 feet into the massive chamber now called Hoyo Negro, or black hole.\n\nUnable to escape - her hip bone shattered from the fall - she died in the hole. With her was a menagerie of similarly doomed megafauna, including saber-toothed cats, elephant-like gomphotheres and giant sloths. As the ice age ended and glaciers melted, sea levels rose and slowly filled the chamber with water, sealing it off from humanity.\n\nNaia's remains lay undetected until 2007, when scuba divers first entered the underwater tomb. In it, they discovered a time capsule of Central American life at the end of the ice age.\n\n\"It's in many ways like a mini La Brea Tar Pits,\" study leader James Chatters said of the Hoyo Negro site. \"But without the tar and (with) considerably better preservation.\"\n\n## DNA Detectives Of North America\n\nThe study is one among a number of recent genetic findings that shed light on early human habitation of the Americas. Together, these discoveries have radically altered the long and heated debate over how humans came to inhabit the New World.\n\nThe source of that debate is major differences of appearance between present-day Native Americans and ancient fossils. Faced with that difference, some archaeologists have argued that the Americas were originally populated by people from Europe as well as Asia.\n\nWithin the last 10 years, however, DNA research has suggested that America's early dwellers emerged from a single ancestral population that initially came from Asia. Penned in by vast ice sheets, these people evolved in isolation for thousands of years in a land between Siberia and Alaska that scientists call Beringia. Then, as the glaciers retreated and Beringia began to disappear amid rising seas, the inhabitants spread swiftly through North and South America, scientists say.\n\nOnce situated in their new world, these founders, or Paleoamericans, would gradually evolve features that are now associated with Native Americans, according to the study authors. The physical differences that have puzzled researchers for so many years are not the result of separate origins, they argue. Naia's genetic connection to some modern-day Native Americans helps prove that common ancestry.\n\n\"Paleoamericans and Native Americans descended from the same homeland,\" Chatters said.\n\nPaleoarchaeologist John Hoffecker said the paper would help reshape debate on the origins of the first Americans.\n\n## Nuclear DNA \"Extremely Fragmented\"\n\n\"For years archaeologists have been debating this transatlantic thing, and really it's been an enormous distraction,\" said Hoffecker. \"This helps us focus on Beringia, which is what we should have been doing all along.\"\n\nArchaeologist Michael Waters said he was excited to see what facial reconstructions of the girl's skull would reveal.\n\n\"That will be pretty interesting,\" Waters said. \"These early skeletons are so rare we have to really get as much information as we can from them.\"\n\nGenetic anthropologist Deborah Bolnick, a member of the study team, said researchers were attempting to extract nuclear DNA from the girl's skeleton. That would provide genetic information from both parents, unlike mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by the mother.\n\nObtaining the nuclear DNA will be challenging, however. It is extremely fragmented, and it's probably contaminated with bacteria, Bolnick said.\n\nThe girl's remains are being stored in a laboratory in Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City.\n\nInitially, researchers hoped to leave the bones in place, which is normal for the preservation of underwater cultural remains.\n\nHowever, researchers discovered that unauthorized divers were entering the chamber and damaging the girl's bones, study coauthor Pilar Luna Erreguerena said. In March, her skull, jawbone and other bones were removed.\n\n\"We were forced to recover five pieces of Naia so far,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Two rare snakelike fish washed up on Southern California beaches last week, puzzling and exciting scientists who know little about the creature that inspired sea serpent legends.\n\nThe oarfish, deep-sea dwellers that remain mostly mysterious to researchers, have only been seen underwater a handful of times. What is known comes from the few carcasses that have washed ashore.\n\n\"If all you knew about deer was roadkill ... how much would you actually know about deer?\" said Milton Love, a research biologist at the Marine Science Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"That's kind of where we are with oarfish.\"\n\nThe 18-foot giant found off Santa Catalina Island on Oct. 13 was among the largest oarfish reported in nearly 20 years. A 14-foot fish beached in Oceanside on Friday was dissected and examined by scientists on Monday.\n\n## Sliced Into Samples For Study\n\nLove said he believes that the deaths of the two fish are probably linked. The most likely cause was a current that carried the weak-swimming creatures from still waters into a near-shore, more turbulent area, which they aren't adapted to surviving in.\n\nDespite its menacing appearance, the serpentine, silver fish is toothless and heavy, with weak, flabby muscles. It glows slightly, and a ribbon-like dorsal fin waves along the length of its body as it sucks down plankton and jellyfish, said Russ Vetter, a biologist who assisted in the smaller fish's dissection.\n\nThe tissue will be divided and sent to research specialists around the world. They will examine the samples to look for clues about the creature and its habitat - its eyes, gills, heart and liver will be studied. Its DNA will be studied to understand the fish's evolution, and its ear bones will be examined to determine age.\n\nThe fish's tissue will be tested for toxins, and data that could indicate low oxygen levels in the water will be examined as they become available, Vetter said.\n\nResults from the research could take years to complete, scientists said.\n\n\"People from all around the world are desperate for a piece of tissue,\" Vetter added.\n\n## \"The Unknown Factor\"\n\nStaff members at the Catalina Island Marine Institute considered burying their 18-foot oarfish carcass, which was too large to refrigerate. But experts at the Natural History Museum said the bones are so fine they would be crushed by the weight of the sand, said Jeff Chace, program director at the institute. The fish was divided among various research institutions because there was so much interest, he said.\n\nThe institute, which educates about 40,000 children a year, hopes to keep the skeleton on display, he said.\n\n\"One of the neat things for kids is the unknown factor,\" he said. \"These discoveries are happening all the time, and it gets kids excited about science.\"\n\nWith more people snapping cellphone photos and posting videos of \"strange fish and fish doing strange things\" to social media, both the public and scientists are more aware of these occurrences, said Philip Hastings, who curates the Scripps Marine Vertebrate Collection at UC San Diego.\n\n\"Everyone has a cellphone with a camera on it,\" Hastings said. \"Social media allows us to distribute those, and get information back to scientists.\"\n\nAs photos of the huge fish have surfaced on the Internet, many theories have been offered as to why they died. One claim working its way around websites and blogs is that an oarfish dying is a sign of a coming earthquake.\n\nExperts, however, stressed that they have not yet pinpointed a cause of death.\n\n\"With a rare event like this, it is a bit troubling, but it's a total mystery,\" Vetter said.'"

            "text": "\tMIAMI, Fla. - President Barack Obama on Wednesday paid his first visit to the Everglades to deliver an Earth Day speech. He spoke about the threat of rising seas at the endangered national park and the risk of climate change across the nation.\n\nBut his choice of South Florida clearly had a political reason, as well. Voters will elect Obama's successor in 18 months, and the Republican candidates for president, including one from Florida, question whether climate change is man-made. They have taken this position despite significant scientific research concluding that climate change is mainly caused by pollution from fossil fuels like oil.\n\nIn a speech delivered at Everglades National Park, the president also got a subtle dig in at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who has come under fire after he ordered state workers to avoid using the term \"climate change.\"\n\n\"Climate change can no longer be denied ... cannot be edited out of the conversation,\" Obama said. The Republican governor, who declined an invitation to join Obama on his Everglades tour, has denied that state workers are forbidden to use the term.\n\n## The River Of Grass\n\nBefore his speech, the president and park rangers walked the Anhinga Trail, the park's most popular tourist stop. They passed baby alligators, sleek cormorants and a pair of black vultures, which are famous for occasionally eating the rubber off visitors' vehicles.\n\nObama said he could think of \"no better place\" to spend Earth Day than the River of Grass, as the Everglades is called. He praised the virtues of the Everglades, remarking that it provides a habitat for both alligators and crocodiles.\n\n\"I'm told this is a good thing,\" he joked.\n\nThe president was also in South Florida to speak about his administration's record on tackling environmental problems. Most notably, it has limited carbon emissions, the pollution many scientists say causes climate change, and spent $2.2 billion on projects to restore the Everglades.\n\nObama was expected to reveal new conservation efforts in four areas of the country, including Southwest Florida. And in a move some say is long overdue, the National Park Service will designate Marjory Stoneman Douglas' cottage in Florida as a national monument. Douglas is a pioneering preservationist whose book, \"Everglades: River of Grass,\" inspired restoration efforts.\n\n## In Senator Rubio's \"Backyard\"\n\nObama's decision to focus on climate change in South Florida also could have implications on the presidential campaign. It could pressure Republicans to debate the subject, which is a touchy one for the Republican Party. Among the climate-change skeptics is presidential candidate Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. A trip to Rubio's backyard to warn about climate change will hardly go unnoticed in the early days of the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"This is not an effort necessarily to go to anybody's home state,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. \"The truth is those Republicans that choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people that they're elected to represent,\" Earnest said.\n\nGovernor Scott on Tuesday called on the federal government to speed up funding to Everglades restoration projects. The White House admits that the government has owed the project money since even before Obama took office. The state has invested $1.9 billion in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project, nearly a billion dollars more than the federal government.\n\nScott said in a statement that Obama must find a way to give Florida the $58 million the government still owes.\n\n\"President Obama needs to live up to his commitment on the Everglades,\" Scott said. \"This has caused critical maintenance delays in the Everglades to linger for over a year.\"\n\n## Slow Death Of The Everglades?\n\nEarnest suggested that Scott make the funding request to the Republican-controlled Congress. He said the governor's criticism was over the top given that Scott's government is avoiding even the use of the term \"climate change.\"\n\nObama's visit comes at a critical time for Everglades restoration, which has dragged on for nearly 15 years.\n\nLast November, Florida voters overwhelmingly to buy land for restoration projects. Yet state lawmakers balked at using the money to buy about 46,000 acres.\n\nRestoration work is also becoming more critical as the rising seas begin taking a toll on the wetlands. This week, scores of scientists revealed new research that showed even more dramatic changes caused by climate change could occur in the future. A United Nations group predicts increases in temperature, sea level and ocean salinity.\n\nMangrove forests, which provide protection against extreme storms and floods in the Everglades, could disappear, studies found. The soil will become more salty, which would allow the ocean to flood the Everglades, shrinking it. The wetlands of the Everglades, which provides much of South Florida's freshwater, are already half their original size.\n\n\"We're at this key moment where there's crucial public recognition\" of the effects of global warming, said Florida International University ecologist Evelyn Gaiser, who has been invited to meet with Obama after his speech. She said awareness of the slow death of the Everglades could be a model for other natural areas endangered by climate change around the world.'"

            "title": "On eve of touchy Alaska trip, Obama renames North America's tallest peak",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Ahead of a historic trip to the Arctic, President Barack Obama erased a former Republican president's name from North America's tallest peak. The change was applauded in Alaska, but heavily criticized more than 3,000 miles away in Ohio. Further controversy surrounding the presidential visit is likely, as the president will be focusing on two touchy subjects: climate change and Arctic drilling.\n\nObama departed Monday morning to Anchorage for the start of a three-day visit. His trip will give the president a chance to see to shrinking glaciers, Arctic temperatures and a mix of messy energy politics. His tour of the nation's largest state is carefully choreographed to call attention to the ways Obama says climate change is already damaging Alaska's stunning scenery.\n\nShowing solidarity with Alaska Natives, Obama announced Sunday that his administration would rename Mount McKinley as Denali, its traditional Athabaskan name. Alaska's governor and congressional delegation praised the long-sought change. However, in Ohio the reaction was very different. There lawmakers widely condemned the decision to strip the mountain of a name honoring former President William McKinley, a son of Ohio.\n\n## McKinley's Ohio Supporters Complain\n\n\"This political stunt is insulting to all Ohioans,\" said Representative Bob Gibbs, Republican of Ohio. \"I will be working with the House Committee on Natural Resources to determine what can be done to prevent this action.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, added that he is \"deeply disappointed in this decision.\"\n\nIn renaming the 20,320-foot mountain, Obama was recognizing the moniker Alaskans have informally used for centuries. The name means \"the high one\" in Athabaskan.\n\nThe central Alaskan peak, which is growing at a rate of about a millimeter a year, was named Mount McKinley in 1896. A prospector exploring the area's mountains came up with the name upon hearing that McKinley had been selected as the Republican presidential nominee. The name was then formally recognized.\n\n## President Is First To Visit Alaska Arctic\n\nObama's excursion north of the Arctic Circle makes him the first sitting president to set foot in the Alaska Arctic, home to Alaska Natives. Alaska Natives have received less attention than other Native groups amid Obama's recent efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans.\n\nStill, the primary focus of Obama's trip is global warming.\n\nBy showcasing thawing permafrost, melting sea ice and eroding shorelines, Obama hopes the trip will underscore the urgent need to combat climate change in the U.S. and overseas. In Alaska itself, however, that message has been met with skepticism by state leaders, as the state is heavily dependent on oil revenue.\n\nAt the same time, environmental groups argued in the lead-up to Obama's trip that he has not done enough to protect Alaska and the climate. They particularly objected to his administration's decision just a few weeks ago to give Royal Dutch Shell a final permit for expanded drilling off Alaska's northwest coast.\n\n## Drilling Risks Minimized, Obama Says\n\n\"I share people's concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well,\" Obama said in his weekly address. However, he said, the state's economy still must rely on oil and gas until the move to cleaner renewable fuels is complete. He said his administration was minimizing the risks of expanded offshore drilling.\n\nObama touched down in Anchorage in the afternoon. He expected to hear from Alaska Natives before speaking at the climate-focused Arctic summit, which involves leaders from Arctic and non-Arctic nations. Setting the stage on Sunday night, Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Alaska that history will not remember climate change skeptics kindly.\n\n## Global Climate Treaty Sought\n\nObama and Kerry are seeking a global climate treaty this December. Obama has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. He plans to use the Alaska visit to press other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama is scheduled to embark on a camera-friendly boat tour of Kenai Fjords National Park and a hike to Exit Glacier. The sprawling expanse of ice is retreating, and environmentalists point to it as a dramatic sign of warming temperatures. Obama's schedule then called for a trek through wilderness. The president's trek will be taped for an episode of \"Running Wild with Bear Grylls,\" an NBC television show that tests celebrities on their survival skills.\n\nThe visit continues Wednesday in Dillingham, in southwest Alaska. There Obama will meet with fishermen locked in an ongoing conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the world's largest salmon fishery. Then he will fly north to Kotzebue, a regional hub in the Alaska Arctic, to focus on the plight of rural, native villages threatened by encroaching climate change.'"

            "text": "\tMUNICH, Germany - To hear their Syrian parents tell it, it has all been for the sake of Yasser and Taha, ages 6 and 9. The family undertook their grueling overland trek across half of Europe to secure a good future for the boys, their father, Zaid Taha, said. After enduring difficult times along the way, the family has finally reached safety in Germany.\n\n\"School for them, a good education - that is the most important thing there could ever be for me,\" said Zaid Taha, a businessman from the Syrian city of Aleppo. He led his family's departure after a barrel bomb fell near their home, killing next-door neighbors.\n\n\"Education, that's their life,\" he said, laying one hand on each boy's head. \"That's my goal - that's my heart.\"\n\n## Tidal Wave Of Migrants Hits Just Before School Begins\n\nAn enormous stream of migrants and refugees - 20,000 people last weekend alone - has come pouring into Germany only days before the Sept. 15 start of the school year. Educators say it will be a struggle to accommodate the young arrivals. Many are disoriented and bewildered after a dangerous journey, and by the shocks of wartime life preceding it.\n\nSyria's ferocious four-year conflict has disrupted schooling for millions of children. Parents who are among the current wave of asylum seekers from there are determined to make up for lost ground and lost time.\n\nAs the tide of migrants and refugees has moved north and west one thing has been heard over and over: Education is the single most prized thing that a new life in Europe has to offer. Parents on jam-packed trains and buses, at chaotic border crossings, in run-down hostels and in refugee-reception centers have all expressed their drive to ensure their children get a good education.\n\n## Can Schools Modify Methods To Handle Children Of War?\n\nGermany's public schools now face the difficult task of suddenly taking in a huge number of new students who do not speak German and who have been traumatized by war and other harsh experiences. Some question whether the schools will be nimble and fast-acting enough to adjust.\n\nThe German state of Bavaria is the entry point for most of the recent flood of arrivals. The law there requires that children of asylum seekers be enrolled in school. Because most newly arrived pupils are not ready for regular classes, public schools and private groups offer preparatory \"transition\" courses ranging from a few months to two years.\n\nDuring such classes, students not only learn the German language but are also taught social customs that may be different from those with which they were raised. For example, boys and girls are taught to look one another directly in the eye when speaking to one another.\n\n## Munich Ramping Up Transition Courses\n\nSchools in Munich, Bavaria's capital, will increase the number of transition courses by about 20 percent over last year's, officials said. However, no one knows whether that will be enough, and if it turns out more are needed, more teachers will have to be hired, a sometimes time-consuming process.\n\nThe recent arrivals poured in so fast that officials are not even sure how many school-age children are among those who will be settled in the city. They hope to have a rough count by next week, before school starts.\n\nSome refugee advocates say German authorities turned a blind eye to months of clear signs that a migrant crisis was coming soon. They say authorities squandered opportunities to prepare not only schools but also a range of social services.\n\n## Officials Should Not Have Been Surprised, Refugee Worker Says\n\n\"Politicians ignored it,\" said Monika Steinhauser, head of the local branch of the Refugee Council, which works closely with city authorities. \"We wondered: Don't they watch the news? Read newspapers?\"\n\nGermany has absorbed waves of migrants before, from the Balkan wars and from its large-scale importation of Turkish labor.\n\nOnce at school, the youngest pupils - whether their native tongue is Arabic or Somali or Dari, the Persian variant spoken in much of Afghanistan - tend to pick up the German language very quickly, educators say. Some newly arrived first-graders can be placed in \"mainstream\" classes after only a brief adjustment period.\n\nHowever, that swift proficiency can carry a pitfall of its own, familiar to immigrant families everywhere: Sometimes even very small children find themselves the \"managers\" of their family, helping to navigate tasks such as doctors' visits or filling out paperwork. The stress of that responsibility can ultimately cause children to struggle in school.\n\n## More Teachers Need Training To Help Traumatized Youth\n\nMany teachers have not been trained to deal with the problems that war-traumatized children face, said Michael Stenger, who heads a group that teaches job skills to migrant and refugee youth.\n\n\"A teacher might not understand why a child who was doing so well initially suddenly begins to struggle,\" he said. \"Their situation is very complicated.\"\n\nSuccess or failure in integrating school-age children into the social fabric will have profound repercussions for years to come, educators say. Although refugees' day-to-day needs are overwhelming - food, shelter, medical care - refugee advocates said that if children thrive in school, it betters the family's longer-term chances of finding its footing.\n\n\"The children first have to calm down and start feeling safe,\" said Steinhauser, of the Refugee Council. \"They need normality, and going to school is something that helps them feel that things are normal.\"\n\nZaid Taha, the businessman from Aleppo, said that while his family was temporarily sheltering in Turkey, he began studying German using YouTube tutorials. He said his children, listening along, quickly surpassed him.\n\n\"Their minds are so fresh, so lively, so receptive,\" he said. \"They are like plants that must be watered with knowledge - but watered now.\"'"

            "text": "\tSURAT, India - Their hands fly with the speed and skill of veteran assembly-line workers. They pause only to wipe sweat from their foreheads, constructing cardboard box after cardboard box.\n\nThese boxes, bound for sari shops in far-off cities, get stacked in multi-colored towers that loom over the small hunched-over workers.\n\nMany of these workers are not yet teenagers, but they fill the dimly lit textile mills and warehouses here in Surat - an industrial city in western India.\n\nMillions of Indian boys and girls work despite a law requiring children younger than 14 to be in school full time, human rights groups say. These groups estimate there are more than 50,000 child workers in Surat alone.\n\n## Balancing Education And Reality Of Poverty\n\nIndia has declared that it wants to end child labor, but a new proposal from the government aiming to help children has been criticized. Advocacy groups say the proposal could actually push more youngsters into the workforce, jeopardizing their education and putting them at greater risk of exploitation.\n\nThe proposal would make it legal to employ children younger than 14 in a \"family enterprise\" that is not deemed hazardous. These changes were added to a 30-year-old law and approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government last month.\n\nUnder the proposed new rules, children would be banned from working in heavy industry, manufacturing fireworks, or other dangerous professions. Still, they could work in almost any other industry, as long the company was owned by relatives, and they worked outside of school hours.\n\nPrime Minister Modi's conservative government said it was trying to balance the need for education and the reality of poverty in India.\n\nIn many poor Indian families, boys and girls help their parents from an early age. Supporters of the proposal say banning all child labor could harm small farmers, shopkeepers, cooks and others who rely on small hands to help them scrape by.\n\nThe number of child laborers in India has fallen sharply over the last decade, according to census data. There were 12.6 million in 2001 and 4.3 million in 2011. Still, these numbers may not count many children working in family businesses.\n\n## \"Child Labor Might Actually Increase\"\n\nChild rights advocates fear the new proposal could create a loophole allowing employers to hire children by calling them \"family.\"\n\nIn Surat, a fast-growing city of 4.6 million, the bosses of textile factories that make cloth regularly tell labor inspectors that the boys working in the factories are relatives.\n\nGovernment surveys, though, show that many child workers in Surat are migrants from poorer states. Experts say the children don't dare to disagree with their bosses. Authorities often lack the resources or willingness to investigate further.\n\n\"Family business sounds good, but what we have found is that bosses say, 'I'm his uncle' or 'he's my son,' and law enforcement is not very keen to verify the claim,\" said Chandrashekhar Deshmukh, head of the nonprofit Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children's office in Surat.\n\n\"If this practice gets legal cover, child labor might actually increase,\" he said.\n\nA 2009 law in India mandates free, full-time schooling for all children younger than 14. Now, authorities are trying to change child-labor rules to match the education law.\n\nThe earlier labor laws in India banned children under 14 from working only in 18 hazardous industries.\n\nThe new proposals giving exceptions for family-businesses must pass both houses of Parliament and the largely ceremonial president. Experts say the proposals have a good chance at becoming law.\n\n## Proposed Rules Make Punishments Harsher\n\nTrade unions representing the workers back the proposals. The unions are made up of people who represent the workers' best interests. They say the new laws would work well with International Labor Organization rules that require countries to set a minimum working age of at least 14 and prohibit employment that would damage a child's health or well-being.\n\n\"It's a very progressive amendment, and it is very clear,\" said Vrijesh Upadhyay, general secretary of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, India's largest labor union.\n\n\"Suppose I am a shopkeeper. My child comes after school and sits with me, he helps me - that's allowed. If in any way he earns money, that is child labor and that will be punished,\" Upadhyay said.\n\nThe proposed rules also make the punishments for employers breaking child-labor laws harsher. They could now face two years in prison and a $800 fine for their first offense. The proposal drops punishments for parents who break the rules once - acknowledging the struggles that cause child labor in the first place.\n\nEducators say any regular work that takes away children's time to study or play can be harmful. They say it can be bad for their development and increase the likelihood that they will drop out of school. Farmwork exposes children to harmful pesticides. In Surat's garment industry, which makes saris and other traditional Indian clothing, children work all-day shifts for as little as $1.50.\n\n## \"Make In India\" Campaign Cited\n\nLast month, Surat authorities raided a restaurant. Two teenage workers from another part of India sat quietly in the administrator's office at a government-run children's home. Mahinder Rajaram, the youngest of nine children from a small village, said he had served tea and snacks for two months, earning about $35 each month.\n\nRamesh Khadsalia, a teacher at the home, said officials were trying to contact the boy's family to send him home. But Khadsalia said there was a good chance that Mahinder would leave again to find work somewhere else. He had dropped out of school in fourth grade and did not even know how old he was.\n\nCritics say the proposed changes send the wrong signal from Modi's government. The country has been trying to promote foreign investment through a glossy campaign called \"Make in India.\"\n\n\"There is a feeling that if children are blocked from working, the garment industry or other industry might suffer,\" said Prabhat Kumar, a child protection manager for the charity Save the Children.\n\n\"But if you really look at the issue, this won't be the case. No one would support the idea of 'Make in India' meaning 'Made by Children,'\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tCHETTALLI, India - Three generations of Tarun Cariappa's family have grown coffee on their highland farm in southern India.\n\nThe farm consists of 38 rolling acres of dark green bushes sprinkled with towering jackfruit and mango trees - and the occasional wild elephant.\n\nBut to that universal question \"Coffee or tea?\" Cariappa, like most Indians, has always answered, \"Tea.\"\n\n\"Dad and Mom started their day with a cup of tea,\" Cariappa said as he surveyed a patch of leafy plants studded with bright-red coffee cherries. \"So I've never drunk coffee.\"\n\n## Tea For Me, Please\n\nAlthough India has long been one of the world's major coffee producers, the country's name is practically synonymous with tea. For most of the last century, it was the world's biggest tea-growing nation. India is renowned for its Darjeeling and Assam varieties, and it's still among the top consumers of tea worldwide. Roadside chai (tea) stalls are a fixture in every throbbing city and distant village.\n\nAsk for a cup of coffee in most of India, though, and you'll get instant coffee crystals drowning in hot milk and sugar, or served over ice with even more sugar. So few Indians drink brewed coffee that virtually all its best crop is exported to countries such as Italy. There the beans are used in name-brand espresso blends and sold at a huge price increase.\n\nNow, however, a handful of Indian farmers and businessmen are trying to hook some of their countrymen on coffee.\n\nCariappa said his family acquired the Udayagiri estate in the coastal state of Karnataka in 1958, a decade after India gained independence from the British Empire.\n\n## Something's Brewing On The Web\n\nFor years, all 15 tons of coffee picked, pulped and sun-dried on his farm annually were sold to a middleman and ended up abroad. Most of his plants are arabica - the more expensive variety favored by top coffee roasters.\n\nTwo years ago, he began selling a small portion of his arabica to Kunal Ross, founder of TheIndianBean.com, a website that sells coffee to domestic consumers and businesses from four family plantations in southern India. Ross roasts the arabica and markets it under the name Appa's.\n\nThe brewed coffee has an earthy, nutty flavor, but Cariappa hasn't tasted it.\n\nHis mother recently returned from the nearby city of Bangalore and reported that the Marriott hotel was stocking bags of Appa's in the rooms.\n\n\"And you didn't even take a picture!\" Cariappa chided her gently as they sat on the veranda of their peach-colored farmhouse, built by his grandfather in the 1950s.\n\n\"I feel like there's some identity to my coffee now,\" Cariappa said. \"Where the bulk of it goes once it's exported, I still have no idea, but those who buy from Kunal know where Appa's is coming from.\"\n\n## Connecting Farmers And Customers\n\nThe effort to build a domestic market for Indian-grown coffee is among the latest signs of this country's business growth. It also represents a bid to lift farmers from the bottom of the supply chain and connect them with Indian consumers who have long viewed coffee as a luxury item.\n\nThe shade-grown coffee bushes that spill across the gently sloping hillsides of southern India are, for most farmers, simply a cash crop, Ross said. He compared it to West African cocoa whose farmers have never tasted chocolate.\n\n\"A lot of farmers barely know they're growing coffee,\" said Ross, a 34-year-old former advertising man who launched his company in 2012. \"To them it's just another crop they sell to the West.\"\n\nUntil recently, consumers in most of India couldn't even buy homegrown coffee, at least not directly.\n\nBefore India began opening up its economy in the early 1990s to more free trade, all growers were required to sell their beans to the government. It then traded agricultural products for items such as weapons from the former Soviet Union, now Russia.\n\n## \"Starved For Choice\"\n\nIn southern India, the only region with a coffee-drinking culture, local beans are mixed with chicory and sometimes cane sugar for a strong, smoky finish.\n\n\"Coffee drinkers are pretty starved for choice here,\" said Matt Chitharanjan, 32, who runs Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, based in New Delhi.\n\nChitharanjan was born in Wisconsin to South Indian parents. He developed a taste for expensive coffee while living in New York and San Francisco. When he moved to the Indian capital in 2012, he found that the expensive Italian brands were often stale by the time they reached stores, and that ordering an espresso even at an upscale restaurant usually resulted in a disappointing concoction of instant coffee, milk and chocolate powder.\n\nHe contacted farmers, persuaded them to sell him beans directly and began roasting them at home. In January 2013, he launched Blue Tokai, which sold 7 tons of coffee across India in its first year.\n\n\"The farmers were a little skeptical. They felt there would be no demand for the quality of coffee they were growing,\" Chitharanjan said. \"But the response has really been great.\"\n\nSome first-time customers, he said, have tried dissolving his ground coffee in water like instant Nescafe, the only coffee Indians could buy for decades.\n\n\"I tell them it doesn't work like that,\" he said. \"There's still some education that has to be done.\"'"

However, despite his success, he is planning to leave his country.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Iraq's capitol city of Baghdad, plans to fly to Turkey next week to join the surge of migrants and refugees seeking a better life in Europe. He will also be part of what Iraqi officials describe as a \"brain drain.\" Iraq is losing its talent as young college graduates like Falah seize what they perceive as a rare opportunity to leave their country and escape the violence. Falah, a civil engineer, will take his talent with him.\n\n## Fear Of The Islamic State\n\nThe United Nations states that more than 50,000 Iraqis have left the country, just in the past three months. They join the hundreds of thousands already making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean region, and the Mediterranean Sea. Nearly 3.2 million people have been forced out of their homes since fighters from the Islamic State group began to seize Iraqi territory early last year.\n\nThe Islamic State is an extremist group attempting to set up its own country governed by Islamic law. It has also been called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The group's fighters have captured parts of Syria and some of northern and western Iraq.\n\nThe mass exit by Iraqis has become the fastest growing displacement crisis in the world. Displacement is when people are forced out of their homes or their country. However, Iraqi officials say a large number of those leaving are not actually displaced, but educated young men like Falah who can afford the journey.\n\n## Losing A Thousand People A Day\n\n\"I saw this wave of young people who were going, many of my friends going, and I saw this as a chance,\" said Falah, who hopes to eventually make it to Germany. \"I'm in a better position than many people, but I want to make a better future for my family.\" Although many displaced families who make the potentially deadly journey travel together, Falah plans to leave his wife and 6-month-old daughter behind in Baghdad, and hopes they can join him legally once he has settled.\n\nJoseph Sylawa, who works for the Iraqi parliament committee for migration and displacement, said it is estimated that the number of people leaving the country is as high as 1,000 per day. \"It's a death blow,\" he said. \"Without its young people, Iraq will never be able to rebuild.\"\n\nIraq has suffered several wars in the last 35 years and because of this unrest, Iraq has long struggled to hold onto its talented people. Many Iraqis returned after the fall of former dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003, but fled when fighting began again.\n\n## \"I Need To Get A Future\"\n\nNow, Iraqis in Baghdad have lived through a decade of constant car bombs, more than one-quarter of the country is controlled by the Islamic State group, and a fall in oil prices is causing an economic crisis. The growing number of militia forces that are fighting the Islamic State fighters is also making it difficult for the government to control the many different armed groups on its streets. \"I think about my country, and how it needs people like me,\" Falah said, adding that five of his friends have also left. \"But my country hasn't given me anything. I need to get a future.\"\n\nLike Falah, 25-year-old engineer Mohammed Jassim is also leaving. He hopes to make it to Finland. Jassim was at the top of his class when he graduated from college two years ago, but has struggled since to find a job, and now works at a car wash. He says, \"My wife and my friends encouraged me to leave. There are thousands like me that are leaving. I expect to see death on the journey, but I depend on God.\"\n\n## Many Displaced People Still Stranded\n\nFalah and Jassim are fortunate because not everyone can get out. In Iraq's camps for the displaced, many who have been forced to flee their homes because of the Islamic State's advance, say they cannot move on to Europe. Thousands of displaced people remain stranded in Iraq's Anbar province because they are unable to obtain permission from authorities to leave.\n\nAnbar province is in the west and is Sunni. Shiite Muslims and Sunni Muslims are two opposing sects of Islam, and the government is worried about the security threat of allowing people into Baghdad or Iraq's south, which is Shiite.\n\nSince it is unsafe to travel over land, Ariane Rummery, a spokeswoman for the U.N's refugee agency, says many people need to fly to Turkey to escape Iraq. Unfortunately, only those who can pay the airfare may make it out.\n\n## Losing The Best Of The Best\n\nThirty-seven-year-old Arkan Naji Obaid and his mother are in a camp for displaced families in Baghdad. They lost everything when they were forced to flee their home in Fallujah at the beginning of 2014, when the Islamic State group seized control. Now, they cannot afford to leave the country. \"I'd tear up my identity card right now for the chance to go to Europe,\" said Obaid, who was badly injured after an American airstrike hit his house in 2003. He also witnessed his father's brutal murder. Obaid continued, \"If people had the money to go, this camp would be empty.\"\n\nIraqis make up just 4 percent of the more than half million people who have escaped to Europe this year. However, that proportion is expected to rise. Shiite Iraqi politician Mowaffak al-Rubaie says that young, Iraqi Sunnis in particular, are struggling to envision a future. However, al-Rubaie says regardless of sect, the best of the best are leaving.'"

The push for food ended their first daylong fast of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.\n\nShouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot refugee camp some 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the northern city of Irbil, the capital of Iraq's self-ruled Kurdish region. The chaotic scene underscored the fearful insecurity of displaced Iraqis as they begin Ramadan. The nation is bitterly divided along sectarian lines and edging toward civil war.\n\nSunnis and Shiites, who worship two different branches of Islam, are frequently at odds in the country. The majority of Iraqis are Shiites and they control the government. Rebel groups made up of the minority Sunnis - who under Saddam Hussein's government once ran the country -are fighting to change the balance of power.\n\n## A Family Flees ISIS Militants\n\nFor Bashir Khalil, a 39-year-old Shiite, and his wife Nidal, a Sunni, Ramadan has been robbed of its rhythm of community and solidarity.\n\nThe couple, who fled Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul after it was captured by Sunni extremists earlier this month, has always been poor. But in their impoverished quarter of the city, neighbors shared their food. Here, when the food ended, there would be no more until another charity came by.\n\n\"When this food finishes, there'll be nothing else,\" 34-year-old Nidal Khalil lamented.\n\nShe and her husband fled after Sunni militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) interrogated them. ISIS was once part of the al-Qaida terrorist group, but later broke off. In the last two weeks, ISIS has seized large parts of northern and western Iraq, including Mosul. It is trying to establish an Islamic country, in Iraq and neighboring Syria, following its version of Sunni religious law and beliefs.\n\nISIS considers Shiites apostates - to not be true Muslims. Bashir was under suspicion as a Shiite, and Nidal was questioned because she worked as a cleaner in a Shiite charity.\n\nThey returned days later after receiving assurances from local gunmen that they wouldn't be harmed, but found their home had been damaged in clashes.\n\n\"We don't want this one or that one,\" Nidal Khalil said, referring to the Shiite-led government and the Sunni insurgents. \"Neither of them cares about us poor people.\"\n\nHer mother-in-law, Shamsa, sat nearby, smoking a cigarette. Fasting Muslims are not supposed to smoke, eat or drink during daylight hours, but the 70-year-old woman shrugged and said she couldn't fast in the heat.\n\nBashir Khalil did not manage to get any of the food donated by a local television station. However, his 10-year-old daughter, Sara, shared the bag filled with containers of soup, rice and meat that she managed to grab in the melee.\n\n## In Tent D42, The Evening's Meal\n\nAt the camp's edge, it was quiet in tent D42, where another refugee named Umm Mishal watched the sun sink over the horizon alongside her youngest daughter Amal, who wore a torn red dress.\n\n\"Ramadan is a generous, blessed month. We will not go hungry,\" the 49-year-old woman said, even as she complained that other families had taken more than their fair share of the donated food, chaotically distributed off the back of trucks.\n\n\"They have grape juice,\" she said, pointing at another family.\n\nThen, on a plastic sheet emblazoned with the United Nations' logo, she set out three tubs of soup, three plates of rice, a loaf of bread, a small roasted chicken and sliced watermelon.\n\nThe evening's meal was taken care of. Suddenly giddy, she exclaimed, \"God has blessed us!\"\n\nShe added with a giggle, \"Eat some chicken!\" '"

            "title": "Refugee tent camp for Syrians grows into a busy Jordanian city",
            "text": "\tZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan - From a town of tents, the Mideast's largest camp for Syrian civil war refugees has grown into a bustling city.\n\nWhat was empty desert just three years ago, the camp now has plans for water and sewage systems and a $20 million solar power plant. It even has ATM machines for refugees to get their aid payments.\n\nBut behind the plans is a cold reality for the 81,000 exiles living in the Zaatari Refugee Camp. Now in its fifth year, the war between the Syrian government and rebels will not be over anytime soon.\n\nSome in the camp deal with that reality by making the best of life in exile.\n\n## Making The Best Of It Isn't Easy\n\nA Zaatari high school senior, for instance, studied hard in cramped quarters to win a university scholarship. A former farmer planted a garden because he was tired of looking at the desert.\n\nDozens of others leave every week to go back to Syria, saying it is better to risk death than live in Zaatari. Jobs are few, one-third of children do not attend school and thousands of young adults lack the chance to learn a trade.\n\n\"As time passes, yes, we can deal with the infrastructure,\" camp boss Hovig Etyemezian said. However, Etyemezian said he is \"a long way from being confident\" that enough is being done to save this generation of refugees.\n\nZaatari, which began on July 28, 2012, is now the ninth-biggest city in Jordan. Today, the tiny Jordanian kingdom hosts 629,000 Syrian refugees, out of a regional total of more than 4 million. More than 100,000 live in camps in Jordan, including 20,000 in the newer Azraq refugee camp, while the rest struggle to survive in cities with cash and food from the United Nations.\n\nInternational agencies such as the United Nations had to reduce aid amid severe money shortages and additional cuts were announced July 31. Refugees who live in cities could soon face the hard choice of moving into a camp where life is cheaper - only Azraq is taking newcomers - or returning to Syria.\n\n## Not An Anniversary To Celebrate\n\nOn Zaatari's anniversary, the transformation from tent camp to permanent city symbolizes the failure of the world to find an end to Syria's war. But some say it is also a reminder that the shift from emergency aid to long-term solutions, such as setting up a permanent water network, should have come much sooner.\n\n\"We simply wasted too much money because we didn't think long-term,\" former Zaatari boss Kilian Kleinschmidt said.\n\nIn Zaatari, one money saver, the solar power plant, will not be ready before the end of 2016. The electricity cuts are a usual subject of camp conversation, along with the question of whether to stay or go back to Syria.\n\nThe number of returnees has dropped to about 30 a day. It is one-fourth of what it was before the outbreak of major fighting several months ago in Syria's southern Deraa province, where many Zaatari residents are from.\n\n## \"Education Is The Way\"\n\nOn July 29, Emad Issawi, his wife Nihad and their three young children stood along the camp's perimeter road with a pile of bags, waiting to catch a bus to the Syrian border. Those who leave are rarely allowed back.\n\nNihad her face covered by a black veil, said she reluctantly gave in to her husband's wishes to go back. \"I'm scared,\" she said.\n\nAcross the street, Mohammed Hariri said he is returning to Deraa after one of his daughters assured him their village is relatively safe.\n\nOthers try to make the most of life in exile.\n\nJumma al-Sheik planted corn, tomatoes, mint and pink althea flowers, creating a popular gathering spot for relatives to drink sweet tea and chat.\n\nAl-Sheik and family members fled a Damascus suburb after chemical attacks by the Syrian government there two years ago, and fighting destroyed their homes.\n\nAl-Sheik, who farmed five acres of vegetables back home, said the garden \"makes everything a little better.\"\n\nAbdel Mutalleb Hariri enrolled his six children in camp schools immediately after they arrived in January 2013. Unable to work as a veterinarian, he now sells clothes while his wife, Fatmeh, teaches English in grade school.\n\nTheir oldest, 19-year-old Alaa, won a scholarship and finished her first year at nearby Al al-Bayt University.\n\n\"Education is the way, especially if you live in a camp,\" said Alaa, one of just a few in her age group to finish high school. Most drop out, some because they cannot afford a university.\n\n## Camp Doors Open, Camp Doors Close\n\nThe camp has opened some new possibilities.\n\nFor hundreds of girls, life in Zaatari has meant a chance to play soccer. On a recent afternoon, about two dozen girls in headscarves practiced on an enclosed dirt pitch under the watch of coach Nour al-Dhaher, who is pregnant.\n\nAlthough al-Dhaher initially enrolled in a coaching course to support her family, now she says loves watching her players transform from bashful to outgoing.\n\n\"Shoot! Shoot!\" al-Dhaher yelled from the bench, cradling another coach's baby.\n\nFor others in the camp, doors are closing.\n\nThere has been a rise in early marriages, and some families marry off girls in their mid-teens, often so they do not have to support them.\n\n\"Here you have to get married young because the situation is difficult,\" said Sabrine al-Masaad, who runs a bridal shop. One of her recent brides was just 14 years old.\n\nAll the while, a new generation of Syrians is being born far from home.\n\nMaan Turkman, 31, gave birth in her shelter recently, because the ambulance was late. Hours later, twins Mohammed and Ahmed lay asleep in a camp clinic's bassinets, swaddled in blankets.\n\nAsked for her hope for them, she said, \"I wish them a bright future in Syria.\"'"

            "title": "Popular vegetable and fruit juices considered healthy, but are they?",
            "text": "\tCHICAGO - The advertising for freshly pressed and blended juices promises instant energy, weight loss, a flood of vitamins and minerals - all in a single, portable, gulpable serving.\n\nHealth-minded consumers seem to have bought the claims - and with them, gallons of juice.\n\nJamba Juice, which sells juices and smoothies, reported $55.1 million in revenue in just 13 weeks. Beverage giant Coca-Cola picked up on the juice trend early and bought juice-maker Odwalla in 2001. In 2007 PepsiCo purchased Naked Juice.\n\nRaw vegetable and fruit juices make up about 10 percent of sales at the health food restaurant chain The Protein Bar, said founder Matt Matros. His customers ask for juice, he said, because they believe it is an important part of their healthy diets.\\n## A Dangerous Trend?\n\nTools for juicing at home are also a big business. And more than 40 books related to juice or smoothies have been released in the last 30 days alone on Amazon.com. The majority mention health, weight loss or both in their titles.\n\nBut according to dietitians and nutrition scientists, juice is far from the healthiest way to consume fruit. One expert went so far as to call its popularity a dangerous trend.\n\n\"The fruit juice industry has essentially taken the 'apple-a-day' mentality and used it to sell fruit juices as healthy,\" said Barry Popkin, a professor in the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nPopkin and other experts would rather see people eating whole fruit. Because most juicing methods remove the produce's fiber, drinking juice omits one of the key benefits of eating fruit. At the same time, it delivers huge amounts of sugar and calories.\n\n\"Every one of the long-term studies ... shows that you increase your risk of diabetes and weight gain\" with regular juice consumption, Popkin said.\n\nOne 2010 study found that those who consumed two or more servings of fruit juice per week had a 29 percent higher risk of developing diabetes than those who didn't drink juice regularly. This elevated risk was not far behind the 42 percent increased risk for weekly soda drinkers.\\n## A Lot Of Calories\n\nUnlike juices, smoothies do provide fiber, as the entire fruit often goes into the blender, skins and all. But they still contain a lot of calories. Choosing a vegetable-based juice or smoothie is one way to reduce the sugar content, health advocates say.\n\nSome experts do argue for the benefits of juices. Elizabeth Ward, a registered dietitian on Jamba Juice's Healthy Living Council, said that because of the vitamins and minerals, juices are a good alternative to beverages like sodas that contain only calories.\n\nWard and Karen May, a spokeswoman for Naked Juice and Tropicana, agree that most Americans don't consume enough produce. But according to them, juice products are a good way to help fix that.\n\n\"Orange juice is a convenient and great-tasting way to help people meet nutrient needs,\" May said. It provides \"vitamin C, potassium and calcium ... in fortified varieties.\"\n\nBut according to Lara Field, a pediatric dietitian at the University of Chicago Medical Center, the sugar in fruit juice far outweighs any possible benefit from the concentrated vitamins and minerals.\n\n\"Eating too much fruit can make us gain weight, just like eating too much candy,\" Field said.\n\nPlus, by not getting the fiber in fruit, juice drinkers miss out on the optimal health benefits, said Bethany Doerfler, clinical research dietitian at Northwestern Medicine.\\n## \"Eat More Fiber\"\n\nAmericans already are harming their health by not consuming enough fiber, said Joanne Slavin, professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota.\n\nDiets higher in fiber are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower body weight, Slavin said. Yet most American adults only achieve half the recommended daily fiber intake, which is 25 to 38 grams.\n\n\"I want people to eat more fiber,\" Slavin said. That includes choosing whole fruits over juice.\n\nEating fiber also contributes to a feeling of fullness, or satiety, that helps prevent people from overeating. One 2009 study found that people who ate apple slices before lunch felt more full than those who drank apple juice. They then consumed 15 percent fewer calories during lunch.\n\nBut the same study suggests fiber isn't the only factor affecting satiety. A third group of participants in the study consumed applesauce containing about as much fiber as that found in the apple slices. That group still consumed more calories at lunch than those who ate raw apples - though not as many as the juice drinkers.\n\nField offered one explanation: Juice, smoothies and applesauce don't require chewing, which research suggests helps signal the body that it's eaten enough calories for the moment.\\n## A Bowl Of Kale\n\nBut experts admit it can be challenging for adults to eat the suggested 1-\\xc2\\xbd to 2 cups of fruit and 2-\\xc2\\xbd to 3 cups of vegetables a day.\n\n\"Sitting down to a bowl of kale is intimidating,\" said Doerfler, and that's one possible reason juices and smoothies are so popular.\n\nAmericans do not eat enough fruits and vegetables, so drinking the different juices is better than nothing, said Cornell University nutritionist Christina Stark.\n\nDoerfler said smoothies and juice could be a less scary way to shift to a more plant-based diet. Predominantly vegetable-based blends are a healthier choice, with a small amount of fruit added to make a juice or smoothie tastier, she said.'"

            "text": "\tTAHIRPUR, India - When the patches of pink skin first showed up on his arm, Ashok Yadav ignored them. But when pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor said the devastating word: Yadav had leprosy.\n\nLeprosy is a bacterial infection that often lies quietly for years before attacking the body's nerves and slowly causing numbness.\n\n\"What followed was like a nightmare,\" said Yadav, who has lived in Kasturba Gram, a leper colony outside New Delhi, since he found out he got the disease 30 years ago. \"I lost my job. My parents felt I would spoil my sisters' chances of getting married. My family felt it would be better if I left home.\"\n\nThe stigma, or fear, of leprosy endures in India, even though the country has made great strides against the disease, which is neither highly contagious nor fatal. Now the number of new annual cases has risen slightly after years of steady decline. Medical experts say the enormous fear surrounding leprosy is hurting efforts to finally get rid of it.\n\n## A Thousand Humiliations\n\nPeople continue to hide their diseases from families and loved ones out of fear they will be cast out. Employers regularly turn away people who have had the disease, even if they've been treated and cured. Many struggle to get driver's licenses and other routine documents. Even the disease-free children of leprosy patients are shunned.\n\nWe face a thousand humiliations every day, said Neelawati Devi. She is a longtime resident of Kasturba Gram. Some 10,000 people live there, including the children of leprosy patients.\n\n\"Our children face taunts and slights when they go to school,\" said Devi, holding out her hands, the stubs of her fingers wrapped in gauze bandages. \"But we want them to get an education and get jobs. Their future should not be ruined.\"\n\nPublic health centers across the country have launched campaigns describing leprosy as the world's \"least contagious communicable disease.\" In other words, of all the diseases you can catch from other people, you are least likely to catch leprosy. Health workers are trying to spread the word that leprosy is not inherited and does not spread through normal contact.\n\nBut the deformities that mark leprosy contribute to the fear surrounding the disease. Hands and feet eventually claw inward and serious injuries often go unnoticed because no pain is felt. Often fingers and toes are lost due to injuries and sores.\n\nAlso called Hansen's disease, leprosy has been curable since the 1940s thanks to antibiotics, and the worst physical deformities can be avoided if it is caught in time. About 95 percent of people have a natural immunity.\n\nWorldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year. Countries have intensified efforts to fight the disease. In India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills the germ that causes leprosy.\n\n## Leprosy's Pain And Stigma\n\nIn 2005, India declared victory, with health authorities reporting less than one case for every 10,000 people. But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy, including in the central state of Chattisgarh, and Maharashtra in western India.\n\nAccording to the health ministry, during 2012-2013 India detected 134,752 new cases of leprosy, slightly more than the 127,295 cases reported a year earlier. India accounts for 58 percent of newly diagnosed leprosy cases in the world.\n\nC.M. Agarwal is the health ministry official in charge of the country's leprosy campaign. Agarwal says the rise in cases is the result of an intensified campaign against leprosy, meaning health workers are reporting cases that otherwise would have gone unnoticed.\n\nBut some activists disagree. They say that after India's 2005 declaration, the leprosy program was merged with the country's public health scheme and scarce resources were reassigned for other urgent causes.\n\nThey also say the problem might be worse than anyone realizes because of leprosy's long gestation period.\n\nIt can take \"five years to 15 before the first signs become detectable. And by then, many others could become infected,\" said P.K. Gopal of the National Forum of Persons Affected by Leprosy, a nongovernmental organization working with leprosy patients.\n\nThe government is stepping up its fight against the disease, assigning additional health workers to 209 districts seen as high endemic areas in 16 states. But that won't end the pain and stigma that leprosy brings to patients and their families.\n\n## In A Leper Colony\n\n\"Our children shouldn't have the shadow of leprosy hanging over their lives,\" said G. Venugopal, one of the elders at Kasturba Gram, as he sat outside his home under Delhi's weak winter sun.\n\n\"They often face taunts in school. People are cruel. They will say: 'Oh, this is the son of a leper.' Then the children say they don't want to go to school and we have to push them,\" he said.\n\nGopal has worked with leprosy patients for more than 40 years. He said that people still treat them badly \"because it's very difficult to change people's attitude over a short period of time.\"\n\nVenugopal has been working with non-governmental agencies to ask the government to raise the amount of money that some leprosy survivors receive. \"They pay us a monthly allowance of 1,800 rupees ($29),\" which is nothing, he said.\n\nThe money does not even pay for bandages that leprosy patients use every day on their sores, said Uttam Kumar, another person who lives in the colony.\n\nLike many others in Kasturba Gram, Kumar was thrown out of his home because neighbors objected to having a leprosy patient in their midst. Kumar's bandaged feet are the only sign of his leprosy, but he spent months on the road before finding a refuge in the one-room shabby apartments of Kasturba Gram.\n\n\"Here we are all anonymous yet we are all fellow sufferers,\" Kumar said. \"Everyone has their own sorrows, but our pain is the same.\"'"

            "text": "\tJOHANNESBURG - More than a year since Liberia's first case of Ebola, the West African nation has been declared free of the deadly disease.\n\nIn the world's worst outbreak since Ebola's discovery in 1976, more people died in Liberia than any other country.\n\nAmid the celebration Saturday, there was a note of caution from the World Health Organization (WHO). Liberia is not out of danger, because neighboring countries Sierra Leone and Guinea continue to struggle with the disease.\n\n\"While WHO is confident that Liberia has interrupted transmission, outbreaks persist in neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone,\" the organization said in a statement. The risk is high that infected people may cross into Liberia and begin another outbreak.\n\n## Disease Struck The Capital\n\nAfter the first case in Liberia was reported in late March 2014, the number of Ebola cases was at first limited and appeared to be contained. But by June, the contagious disease had hit the capital, Monrovia. It was the first time it had ever spread to a densely populated city.\n\nThousands died, and for a while health experts feared that the disease would spin out of control and become an awful new part of everyday life in Liberia. The number of infections finally began to decline in October, and the burial of the last victim came on March 28.\n\nConfirmed and probable deaths from Ebola have surpassed 11,000 in West Africa, including more than 4,700 in Liberia.\n\n## Ebola Crossed Borders Like Wildfire\n\nIn Guinea, 2,387 deaths have been attributed to Ebola, and Sierra Leone recorded more than 3,900, according to WHO figures.\n\nThe Ebola epidemic began in Guinea in December 2013, spread to Sierra Leone and then skipped across the border into Liberia.\n\nOne reason why the virus spread so quickly was the large number of people crossing the borders and the persistence of unsafe burial practices, with the touching of the dead an important part of the region's culture. People traveled across borders to attend funerals and returned home with the illness, infecting family members and neighbors.\n\nMany of those who died were health workers, community nurses and faith healers, who treated people without protection particularly in the early stages of the epidemic. In Liberia, 375 health workers were infected and 189 died. More than 860 health workers were infected in the region and more than 500 died.\n\nThe WHO said Liberia's eradication of the virus was \"a monumental achievement\" in dealing with the most complex outbreak of the disease ever seen.\n\n## Overwhelmed Treatment Centers\n\nThe incubation period for the virus is 21 days, and a country can be declared free of Ebola only after 42 days have passed.\n\nAs of May 6, the total number of suspected cases during the outbreak was close to 27,000. As the disease peaked in Liberia in August and September, the number of cases was increasing rapidly, by 300 to 400 a week.\n\nPatients often mistook their symptoms for typhoid or malaria. Many of them tragically delayed seeking treatment, infecting members of their families.\n\nTreatment facilities were swamped with cases, and patients often died in terrible circumstances at the gates of treatment centers. In many cases, there was no room inside the overcrowded facilities to treat them safely.\n\nTaxis bringing sick passengers for treatment may also have spread the disease.\n\nEntire families were killed. Some orphans were left as sole survivors.\n\nTo help stop the spread of the virus, schools were closed and public gatherings were banned. Ambulances struggled to reach patients in time. In some cases, community members left bodies in the streets. In others, family members carried their loved ones to hospitals in wheelbarrows.\n\nSurvivors of the disease told horror stories of the conditions in treatment centers, with people suffering and dying next to them, or of mothers dying, leaving sick children behind. Other patients often stepped in to help when children were left alone in treatment centers.\n\n## \"A Sense Of Community Responsibility\"\n\nAs late as September, the world's response to the crisis was disastrously slow. The lack of enough beds in treatment centers led to thousands of unnecessary deaths.\n\nAt one point, almost no beds for Ebola patients were available in any treatment facility in the country, the WHO said in its statement.\n\n\"It is a tribute to the government and people of Liberia that determination to defeat Ebola never wavered, courage never faltered. Doctors and nurses continued to treat patients, even when supplies of personal protective equipment and training in its safe use were inadequate,\" it said.\n\nThe statement gave much credit to local volunteers, who worked in treatment centers, on burial teams or as ambulance drivers. They \"were driven by a sense of community responsibility and patriotic duty to end Ebola and bring hope back to the country's people,\" the WHO statement said.\n\n## Time To Heal\n\nLiberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that for many in the country, it will take a generation for the pain and grief to heal. She referred to the slow response of the international community when she said that the epidemic was a \"scar on the conscience of the world.\"\n\nA White House statement urged vigilance to prevent the return of the disease to Liberia.\n\n\"We must not let down our guard until the entire region reaches and stays at zero Ebola cases,\" the statement said.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO, Ill. - Parents hoping to avoid a wait for a visit with Santa Claus at Woodfield Mall near Chicago can now reserve a spot in line with the jolly fellow, though it will cost them.\n\nTo make an appointment to see St. Nick at the Minion-themed Ice Palace, which opened Nov. 5, the mall for the first time is requiring a $10 fee that can be used toward the purchase of a photo package.\n\nThe new fee and elaborate home for Santa are part of a trend across the country to make holiday displays grander at shopping centers. The goal is to bring online shoppers back to malls.\n\n## Santa Goes Hollywood\n\nHoliday displays are \"on the scale of what we are calling an attraction now,\" said Ruth Rosenquist, a spokeswoman for Noerr Programs, which sends Santas and photographers to 278 malls across the United States, including Woodfield. \"They are full-scale Hollywood productions.\" she said.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason for the shift is the way the Internet has driven shoppers away from malls, leaving retailers desperate for gimmicks to bring them back.\n\n\"I really believe that it's a result of online shopping and the fact that developers are now realizing that Santa Claus is a physical manifestation of the holidays,\" she said. Santa brings people back to the malls.\n\nMalls in the Chicago area typically allow free visits with Santa but charge fees for photos and do not let parents take pictures, operators say. A spokesman for Simon Properties, which runs Woodfield, said kids still can see Santa for free if they walk up and wait in line. The advance charge is only if they want to reserve their place. The fee helps to ensure that families keep their appointments with photographers, the spokesperson said.\n\n## \"A New Level Of Greed\"\n\nMary Jo Shepherd, a parent who has brought her kids to Woodfield for years, considers the advance fee \"a new level of greed.\"\n\nAs a social worker, she said she sees families who cannot afford the photo fees. She considers Christmas exhibits at malls and stores, like the holiday window displays at Macy's in downtown Chicago, to be a \"give-back\" to customers, and was appalled a few years ago when Woodfield stopped letting parents take their own pictures during Santa visits. \"It just keeps getting worse and worse every year.\"\n\nShelly Kunets, a mom who was visiting Woodfield with her newborn, said she would not pay to see Santa.\n\n\"I think it's taking away from the spirit of why we see Santa,\" she said. \"The magic is in meeting Santa. The rest is just extra.\"\n\nBut Matthew Caczewe, a father of two girls, said he works in sales and understands why malls might have to charge for bigger exhibits.\n\n\"To get more, where does the money come from?\" he asked.\n\nAs expensive as the Santa experience can get, it is not surprising that the holiday legend has evolved into a marketing icon, said Robert Thompson. He teaches television and popular culture at Syracuse University.\n\n\"Let's remember, Santa is the patron saint of the commercialization of Christmas,\" he said. \"He represents the idea of a bag bursting with presents. On that level, it's hard to get really worked up, because he's always been tied up with moneymaking.\"\n\n## One Santa Spreads The Free Word\n\nThere are still good options for people who want a simple visit with Santa without the fees or reservations, according to none other than Santa himself. John Sullivan, who once managed Santa mall exhibits and now portrays Santa at a variety of events, maintains a long list of free events on his website, at www.santainchicago.com\n\nMost cities, villages, park districts and chambers of commerce offer free visits with Santa and let parents take their own pictures, he said. He attended one such memorable event on Chicago's South Side.\n\n\"It was very rewarding, because the kids were so happy to have a Santa there,\" he said. \"The parents were delighted they didn't have to go to a mall and pay.\"\n\n## It's A Production\n\nOf all the local Christmas productions, perhaps the most elaborate was scheduled to begin Nov. 14 at Oakbrook Center, in Oak Brook, Illinois. It has teamed up with DreamWorks Animation to create \"Adventure to Santa,\" a 20-minute movie that leads visitors on an interactive journey to find Santa, with help from Shrek, Donkey and their friends. Participants attend a Sleigh Flight School and choose one of three obstacle courses. The adventure is offered at only four other sites nationwide, including, appropriately, Las Vegas.\n\nOne change to the attraction in its second year is that reservations require the purchase of a photo package, which costs from $39.99 for parties of up to five, to $73.99 for parties of up to eight.\n\nThe show was such a hit last year, said Suzanne Beres, a spokeswoman for General Growth Properties, which manages the mall, that online reservations began this year in August.\n\n\"We are taking reservations to make it easier and quicker,\" Beres said. \"It allows you to shop and dine and go directly to see Santa. It kind of eliminates standing in a line.\"\n\n## Recalling Simpler Times\n\nBut there is hope for those who long for simpler times, said Rob Albertson of a company called Bandwith Marketing. Marketing experts have noticed a backlash from the public and some retailers who refuse to give in to today's commercial trends, such as letting \"Black Friday\" creep into Thanksgiving and charging for pictures with Santa.\n\n\"When things become too big or too grand or too monetized, there's a nice pendulum shift back,\" he said.'"

There are now more than 70 patients across California, six other states, and Mexico.\n\nHealth officials pulled the students out of class at Huntington Beach High School. They took the precaution after learning that a student with measles had gone to class when school resumed in January. They said they would take the same action in other schools if measles are detected.\n\n## Fast-Spreading Disease\n\nMeasles causes a rash that first appears on the head and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms include fever, red eyes and a runny nose. Spread by simply coughing and sneezing, measles can be contagious for four days before the rash appears and four days after.\n\n\"If there is a case in the school and their child is not immunized, they will be removed from the school for 21 days,\" said Dr. Eric Handler, the Orange County public health officer. \"From an epidemiological standpoint, in order to prevent spread of the disease, this is a necessary measure.\"\n\nEpidemiologists study public health and how diseases spread.\n\nThere is a vaccine against measles that is highly effective. However, some parents choose not to give their children the shots because of personal beliefs. Orange County is home to several upscale communities where a higher-than-average number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their kids.\n\nExperts say this becomes a serious problem when 8 percent or more of a group of people are not vaccinated.\n\n## Many Children Are Unprotected\n\nIn the Huntington Beach City School District, many kindergarten classes have more than 8 percent of students who are not vaccinated. At S. A. Moffett Elementary, 10 percent were not vaccinated. At Huntington Seacliff Elementary, it was 11 percent.\n\nAs of 2013, only 3.1 percent of kindergartners statewide were unvaccinated,\n\nSince 2002, fewer and fewer kindergartners have been starting elementary school with all their vaccinations. Some parents are suspicious of the shots, worrying that they cause autism, even though many scientific reports have thoroughly shown that they do not.\n\n\"The vaccine is safe,\" Handler said. \"We can prevent this disease if people get vaccinated.\"\n\nMany parents of this generation have never seen children kept home from school because they were not caught up on their shots. Some public health experts say it's time to do that again.\n\n## It Only Takes One Sneeze Or Cough\n\nMeasles is so infectious - it spreads through the droplets from a sneeze or cough - that one sick person walking through a community of unvaccinated people can infect a dozen or more of them.\n\n\"If the rate of unimmunized is as high as it seems to be, you're going to get more cases, and then you're going to get more spread from those,\" said Dr. James Cherry, a UCLA pediatric infectious diseases researcher.\n\nThe measles vaccine has been around since 1963 in the United States, but there were still major outbreaks of measles nationwide in 1976-77 and 1989-91.\n\nIn 1977, about 50,000 students in Los Angeles County were told to stay home from school until they could confirm that had been vaccinated or were getting the shots. Within days, most them returned to school having been vaccinated, and the measles cases dropped quickly.\n\nSome parents today, faced with the measles outbreak, are rethinking their decisions to not vaccinate their children.\n\n## Rethinking Vaccine Decisions\n\nA mother at Mariners Park in Newport Beach said that after her daughter Sienna was born 2 1/2 years ago, she wanted to follow an alternative vaccine schedule - different than official recommendations. The schedule, published in \"The Vaccine Book\" by Dr. Robert Sears, delays or skips certain immunizations, much to the dismay of public health officials.\n\n\"I didn't want to flood her system with a bunch of chemicals all at once. I wanted to be informed and not trust what medical professionals said,\" the mother, Stephanie, said. She asked that her last name not be used, citing concerns about her family's privacy.\n\nBut the outbreak worries her, and she said her daughter will get vaccinated next month. \"It was a hard decision,\" she added.\n\nSome parents who vaccinated their children are concerned by the risk caused by unvaccinated children.\n\n\"It scares me,\" Julie Angus said while walking her preschooler Mia, 4, and first-grader Gabriel, 6, home from school.\n\n\"They're making a decision for their child that affects other children. I personally feel that if that's your choice you should home-school your child,\" Angus said.\n\n## It Started At Disneyland\n\nPublic health officials believe the current measles outbreak began at Disneyland a week before Christmas. The theme park attracts visitors from all over the world, including places in Europe and Asia where measles is still a serious problem.\n\nSince then, the disease has continued to spread by people who were not vaccinated.\n\nFive of the diagnosed measles patients were Disneyland employees. Of the employees at Disneyland diagnosed with measles, two have been vaccinated, health officials said. The vaccination status of the other workers was still being investigated.'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - First lady Michelle Obama came to New York on Thursday to talk about American children who are obese. Once again, she asked parents to \"dive into\" the fight to help American children become healthier.\n\nObama spoke at an event at which the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) announced it would dedicate $500 million to reduce the number of very overweight children. The event took place at  Edward A. Reynolds West Side High School in Manhattan.\n\nThe foundation named three strategies that individual families can embrace. First, families can eliminate all sugar-sweetened beverages from the diets of children younger than 5. Second, parents can engage kids in physical activity every day. Third, families can ensure that children enter kindergarten at a healthy weight.\n\n## \"Push The Envelope\"\n\nObama praised the announcement by the foundation. \"I want to challenge you and folks across the country to make an RWJF kind of commitment at your own scale,\" she said. \"I want you to really dive into this issue in your schools, your organizations, community, your company, your family, wherever you are a leader and decision-maker. Dive in.\"\n\nShe added, \"If Robert Wood Johnson can invest half a billion dollars ... surely we can push the envelope and aim just a little higher in our own efforts.\"\n\nWhile she encouraged all Americans to do more, she also praised the efforts that many are already making. Obama called parents who make healthier choices at the supermarket \"unsung heroes.\"\n\nObama noted that the rate of children who are obese has stopped increasing, and that in some age groups the rate has even declined. She cautioned that the progress is \"fragile,\" though, emphasizing that the nation \"can't afford\" to slow down the effort to reduce the number of obese children.\n\nChildren's health is one of the issues Obama has become known for since she became first lady in 2009. Five years ago, she began a project called \"Let's Move!\" which encourages kids to exercise.\n\n## A Culture Of Health\n\nDr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey is president and chief executive of RWJF, a national health organization based in New Jersey. According to Lavizzo-Mourey, Americans can change their habits and embrace a culture of health, just as they have changed their attitudes toward smoking and the importance of using seat belts in cars.\n\nThe foundation's new $500 million donation follows up on a $500 million donation made in 2007, bringing the foundation's total contribution to the effort to $1 billion.\n\nThe money will be distributed nationwide during the next 10 years to partner groups fighting to reduce the number of very overweight children. In addition to helping parents do their part, the foundation also aims to make school environments healthier and make healthful foods more available. It will especially focus efforts on children of color and children living in poverty, Lavizzo-Mourey said.\n\nObama mentioned a few examples of progress since 2007, when the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation made its first $500 million contribution to help kids grow up at a healthy weight. Since then, some fast-food restaurants have started including apples and skim milk in their kids' meals. Also, the labeling on food has become clearer, helping parents choose healthier products in supermarkets, and schools throughout the country have adopted higher health standards for lunches.\n\n\"We've seen the progress we can make when we educate parents and we help them make healthier decisions,\" Obama said.'"

            "title": "To millennials, giving time to charity means as much as donating money",
            "text": "\tPITTSBURGH, Pa. - Earlier this month, on the national day of philanthropy known as Giving Tuesday, about 100 employees of Dick's Sporting Goods showed up at the Sarah Heinz House on Pittsburgh's north side. They were there to clean, paint and decorate for the holidays.\n\nMillions of people worldwide marked Giving Tuesday by making online donations to charities. Meanwhile, the group from Dick's - many of them millennials in their 20s and 30s - worked side by side at the Sarah Heinz House with middle-school students who participate in clubs, lessons and other activities at the nonprofit facility.\n\n\"They completely cleaned and beautified gyms, kitchen areas and classrooms,\" said Deb Hopkins. She is the executive director of Pittsburgh Cares, an organization that matches businesses and individuals with volunteer opportunities.\n\nFor millennials, she said, being involved in a hands-on activity that helps a group in need is often as fulfilling as pledging financial support. \"(Millennials) really want to see a direct impact.\"\n\n## Gifts From The Grassroots\n\nGiving Tuesday was launched in 2012 as an antidote to the shopping frenzy between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday. This year it generated an estimated $116.7 million from nearly 700,000 donors, according to its founders, the 92nd Street Y in New York.\n\nIt also sparked a wave of grassroots volunteerism like the spruce-up at Sarah Heinz House. According to a study released this month, millennials are more inspired to give when charities provide such on-the-ground opportunities.\n\n\"We've learned that millennials deem monetary giving just as important as giving their time, skills and network to a cause,\" said Derrick Feldmann, lead researcher for The Millennial Impact Project. The project studied how nine nonprofits conducted their Giving Tuesday fundraising campaigns.\n\nBased in Indianapolis, the project was launched in 2009 to study and analyze millennial behavior. Its research on millennial giving is funded by the Case Foundation, which is run by philanthropists Steve and Jean Case. Steve Case was a co-founder of America Online.\n\nThe project decided to study Giving Tuesday, said Feldmann, because it's a relatively new digital-based initiative that has relied mainly on social media to generate contributions.\n\n\"It looks and feels like millennials should be a part of it and would be highly involved ... so we try to find out whether that's true or not.\"\n\n## \"Firsthand\" Experience Counts\n\nThe researchers recruited nine nonprofits, including Rutgers and Otterbein universities, the University of North Carolina and WBEZ public radio in Chicago. They studied the nonprofits' marketing efforts leading up to Giving Tuesday and how they promoted it the day of the event.\n\nNonprofits that used digital-only campaigns limited to emails and social media posts \"didn't get the highest response rate\" from millennials, said Feldmann.\n\nBut when nonprofits linked Giving Tuesday to actual events, \"they got the most heightened millennial response,\" he said.\n\nAt the University of North Carolina (UNC), for example, a student-giving council and a young alumni leadership council hosted on-campus Giving Tuesday events.\n\nUNC created its own Twitter hashtag, \"#TarHeelTuesday,\" for the day, and encouraged students to volunteer with a student ambassadors program and to share their photos on Snapchat.\n\nThe university raised about $236,000 - far exceeding its goal of $150,000 - including about $23,000 from millennials, who accounted for 29 percent of all donors.\n\n\"A combination of digital, grass-roots and self-organizing strategies for millennials to own that day and experience it firsthand will get a good response,\" Feldmann said.\n\n## Teaching Children To Give\n\nIn addition to the Dick's event at Sarah Heinz House, Pittsburgh Cares organized other Giving Tuesday activities, including some involving sorting and packaging inventory for the U.S. Marine Corps' Toys for Tots program.\n\nAn evening event at the regional Toys for Tots storage facility was designed for families so that children could help their parents choose and pack toys for boys and girls in need.\n\n\"That's another trend: Millennials very much want their children involved,\" Hopkins said. \"I get four or five calls a day from people looking for volunteer opportunities for kids as young as 5 years old.\"\n\nThe idea of linking giving to hand-on participation in charitable causes isn't limited to millennials, though, she said.\n\n\"I wouldn't say they want that experience more than other people. They are more tech savvy, but we see a tremendous amount of activity among baby boomers and our retired and senior volunteers.\"'"

            "title": "Medieval potion-making melds with modern medicine to fight MRSA",
            "text": "\tResearchers in England have rediscovered an ancient medicinal potion that appears to fight a very modern problem.\n\nThe elixir works against a deadly drug-resistant bacterial infection called Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Better known as MRSA (pronounced mersa), it is very difficult to treat.\n\nLet's imagine that during a nighttime escape through Sherwood Forest, the legendary English outlaw Robin Hood scratched his eye on a branch and developed an infection. In nearby Nottingham, he might well have asked an herbalist about it. The early pharmacist would fetch a brass vessel, brew a remedy of bile from a cow's stomach and Allium - a plant from the garlic family - and create an ointment to treat the patient's inflamed eye.\n\nUntil recently, the recipe for that medieval remedy lay unnoticed in the brittle pages of a thousand-year-old text. Titled \"Bald's Leechbook,\" the early book is shelved in the library of the University of Nottingham's Institute for Medieval Research.\n\n## An Ancient Recipe\n\nLeafing through the book, Viking studies professor Christina Lee wondered what its ancient recipes revealed about medieval medical knowledge. She pondered how, a thousand years ago, healers and herbalists chose their treatments and if they had guessed right.\n\nLee translated the recipe for the eye ointment from the original Old English recipe in \"Bald's Leechbook.\" She then asked chemists at her university's Center for Biomolecular Sciences to make up the treatment and test to see if it worked.\n\nLee's request came at an important time for Nottingham's Freya Harrison, a biologist who studies microscopic life forms, who was looking for inspiration. Lee's idea allowed Harrison and her team to reach deep into the past in search of undiscovered or underappreciated antibiotics.\n\nScientists in Harrison's lab followed the recipe precisely, cooking four separate batches of the ointment. They also devised a control experiment using the same quantity of distilled water and brass to mimic the brewing container, but without the vegetable ingredients.\n\nIn a lab, the scientists made the MRSA bacteria grow out of control. They applied the ancient ointment and discovered the thousand-year-old recipe had a powerful killing effect. Only about 1 in 1,000 bacterial cells survived.\n\nLater, in infected wounds in mice, the remedy killed 90 percent of MRSA bacteria.\n\n## A Powerful Concoction\n\nHarrison says she was \"absolutely blown away\" with the antique recipe's effects. She had assumed it might show \"a small amount of antibiotic activity,\" but not to this extent. Researchers have found some of its elements - copper and bile salts in particular - to have some effect on bacteria in the lab. And plants in the garlic family are known to make chemicals that interfere with bacteria's ability to damage infected tissues.\n\nBut compared with the control substance, the combination of these elements in this ancient formulation was powerful, Harrison said. The eye salve had the power even to get through the sticky coating and kill the dense clusters of MRSA, which are resistant to most antibiotics.\n\nIt was only when Harrison's lab diluted the ointment to see whether it would continue to kill bacteria that they figured out how it worked. The diluted salve wasn't strong enough to kill the MRSA, but it interfered with communication among its cells. This is a key finding because those signals switch on genes that allow bacteria to damage infected tissues. Blocking this signaling is a promising way to treat infection.\n\n\"We know that MRSA-infected wounds are exceptionally difficult to treat in people and in mouse models,\" said Kendra Rumbaugh. She carried out the testing of Bald's remedy on MRSA-infected skin wounds in mice. \"We have not tested a single antibiotic or experimental therapeutic that is completely effective,\" added Rumbaugh, a professor of surgery at Texas Tech University's School of Medicine. But she said the ancient remedy was at least as effective - \"if not better than the conventional antibiotics we used.\"\n\nThe collaboration between Old English remedies and microbiology has given rise to a new program at Nottingham. Called AncientBiotics, researchers will study remedies that combine the ancient arts and modern sciences.'"

            "text": "\tMilly Wu marched through the J. Paul Getty Museum's galleries of 19th-century European paintings. She stopped just long enough to take pictures of Monets, Manets and, of course, Vincent Van Gogh's \"Irises.\"\n\nWith a series of clicks, masterpieces became souvenirs to share with her friends back home in Hangzhou, China.\n\nBut when she reached the threshold of a gallery filled with fancy French furnishings from the reign of the King Louis XIV of France, the 11-year-old just looked around.\n\n\"Wah,\" she gasped - Chinese for \"wow.\"\n\n\"It's very beautiful,\" said her dad, Will Wu, an information technology professional who used to work for Hewlett-Packard and speaks some English. \"Mr. Getty had a great eye for this type of item.\"\n\n## Promoting Art And Culture\n\nThe Getty and other Los Angeles museums increasingly have their eyes on people like the Wus. They exemplify the rapid growth in tourism from mainland China. The Getty has taken the lead, aiming to leverage such advantages as free admission, a striking garden to go with the art masterpieces, and a tram ride to a hilltop perch in Brentwood that affords sweeping vistas of Los Angeles.\n\nTo capture more Chinese tourists, the Getty recently sought help from experts in China. They are helping it establish a presence on Weibo and WeChat, the leading social media sites for mainland Chinese. It also piggybacks on the Los Angeles tourism board's efforts to promote LA destinations for visitors interested in art and culture.\n\nWith a dozen other cultural organizations in the city, the Getty has taken advantage of \"China Ready.\" The tourism board launched the program last year to help businesses of all kinds become magnets for Chinese vacationers.\n\nThose that complete the program are designated \"China Ready\" - a seal of approval they can use in proposals to the Chinese travel market.\n\nDespite such efforts, not even the Getty seems likely to establish itself as a leading destination for group tours. These tours send travelers through Southern California by the busload on routes usually planned by tour organizers in China. In 2008, the Getty Center became the first Los Angeles museum to host a tour group from China after the Chinese government lifted restrictions on traveling to the U.S. But U.S. tour operators who specialize in large group tours say that the main attractions in Los Angeles continue to be theme parks, Hollywood, excursions to Las Vegas and Yosemite, and spending sprees in luxury shops and outlet malls.\n\n## Student Groups Go To Getty\n\n\"The Getty is impressive, it's beautiful. I think it's a shame it's not featured in the (tours) right now,\" said Harry Chen, owner of Joy Holiday, a San Francisco Bay Area company that regularly runs tours of Los Angeles. \"A minority of people are going to be interested in a museum. (Others) love to be at the most popular places, taking pictures.\"\n\nDaniel Shen, president of Lion Tours in Los Angeles, said that it's different for student groups that mainly come in the summer. \"Every one of them that I handle from Asia requests the Getty Museum,\" he said. Students typically come for longer stays and have time to explore Los Angeles in greater depth, he said, making a museum visit a natural.\n\nEven without the big tour groups, the Getty and other art museums have a chance to attract increasing numbers of Chinese visitors, though more likely by the carload than the busload. \"Free individual travelers,\" a term for people who make their own travel arrangements and set their own destination plans, are seen as the future of Chinese tourism to the United States.\n\nA new agreement with China is expected to generate many return trips: Instead of visas having to be renewed each year - which involves extra costs and waiting - visas from China to the U.S. are now good for 10 years.\n\nVisitors \"will have time on their hands to discover places that fit whatever their interests are,\" said Chen, the San Francisco tour operator. \"The extension of the visas will really help places such as the Getty Museum.\"\n\nAccording to figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce, visits from mainland China to Los Angeles rose 20 percent in 2014. The numbers are expected to continue growing by at least 10 percent annually.\n\n## Mandarin Maps And Guidebooks\n\nBecoming \"China Ready\" requires cultural sites to launch an informational Web page in Mandarin, issue Mandarin maps and guidebooks, and accept China UnionPay, Chinese travelers' favored credit card. Having staffers who speak Chinese is recommended but not required. Providing museum audio tours in Chinese and adding Chinese dishes to menus at food courts are also desirable but not required. At the Getty's cafeteria, visitors can get a menu in Chinese, and it usually will include a Chinese dish.\n\nThe Getty can't say how many Chinese tourists it draws. Some general evidence comes from the 14,000 map-and-guide booklets in Chinese that were plucked from the information booth in the Getty Center's entrance during the first three months of 2015. The Getty estimates it hands out about 100 audio devices daily that provide a guide to the museum in Mandarin.\n\nWill Wu asked a Chinese emigrant friend who lives in Los Angeles to recommend an art museum. Milly, the 11-year-old who took photos of the paintings, takes painting classes back home. This was a chance to foster her interest in art.\n\n\"My girl loves to see a lot of famous paintings, and my friend told me in the Getty Center there are a lot of famous paintings,\" Wu said.\n\nWhich did Milly like best? Her face, which had been firm and intense while she moved through the galleries, rounded into a big smile as she answered in Chinese.\n\n\"She says she likes the irises,\" her father said.'"

            "title": "U.S. food labels to get a major revamp",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - On Thursday the Obama administration proposed the first major revamp of nutrition labels in more than two decades. The update emphasizes calorie information, including the amount of added sugars. It also revises serving sizes to reflect how people really consume food.\n\nThe revision is aimed, in part, at addressing serious public health issues. These include [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) - the condition of being extremely overweight - and other long-term diseases, such as diabetes. Administration officials believe the new labels could lead consumers to make more healthful food choices. They also claim they would encourage the food industry to reformulate some products, particularly those with high amounts of added sugar.\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama was scheduled to announce the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposal at the White House, together with top administration officials. She has made better nutrition a focus of her \"Let's Move!\" campaign to battle childhood obesity.\n\n\"Our guiding principle here is very simple: that you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up an item off the shelf, and be able to tell whether it's good for your family,\" she said in a statement.\n\n## Calorie Counts In Larger Typeface\n\nThursday's announcement began a 90-day period for public comments on the proposal. The administration plans to release a final set of rules within the next year, although there is no deadline.\n\nGiven the costs tied to revising nutrition labels, found on about 700,000 products, the FDA is proposing an implementation period of two years.\n\nThe Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 300 companies, promised to work with the FDA, saying \"the time is right for an update,\" and calling the proposal \"a thoughtful review.\" But the organization also said: \"It is critical that any changes are based on the most current and reliable science. Equally as important is ensuring that any changes ultimately serve to inform, and not confuse, consumers.\"\n\nOn the proposed new labels, the calorie count would appear in larger, bold typeface. The updated labels would also include a separate entry in the sugar section to distinguish between added sugar and natural sugar.\n\nAdministration officials said that would help consumers comply with dietary guidelines recommending Americans decrease added-sugar intake. But Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, predicted that the move could prompt pushback from large food companies. Such companies have a powerful Washington lobbying operation with influence on lawmakers.\n\n\"The food industry is really eager for people to not know how much sugar there is,\" she said.\n\n## Focus On Added Sugars\n\nStill, some public health advocates said that the added-sugar category doesn't go far enough. The FDA should also display the amount of sugar as a percentage of recommended daily intake, argued Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"So many people consume far too much,\" he said.\n\nJacobson noted that the American Heart Association recommends women consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar per day and men no more than 35 grams per day. One can of soda alone contains about 40 grams.\n\nTo ensure compliance with the proposed requirement, companies would have to keep records of added sugar for FDA inspection.\n\nThe FDA proposal would also revise serving sizes to reflect the most recent data on consumer habits. The serving size for soda, for example, is currently 8 ounces. This number is meant to equal the quantity of soda people usually drink at one time, on average. However, consumers often drink soda in 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.\n\nThe current rules allow manufacturers to use a larger serving size, as some soda makers do. But the proposed rule would require the serving size to be at least 12 ounces.\n\nWith the update, the serving sizes set in 1994 would increase for some products, such as ice cream, but would decrease for other products, such as yogurt.\n\n\"The serving sizes for many foods are a joke now,\" said Jacobson, who praised the proposed revisions. \"The half-cup of ice cream\" or \"2-ounce muffins and bagels,\" he said, haven't been seen in American eating habits \"in decades.\"\n\n## Revamp Aims To Curb Obesity\n\nCertain items that are typically finished all at once, such as a 20-ounce soda bottle, would be listed differently than they are now: The updated label would require manufacturers to display nutrition information for the entire package, not just the serving size.\n\nIf a food package is two times the serving size and could be consumed all at once, such as a 24-ounce soda bottle, the FDA would require a dual-column label. This would provide a nutritional breakdown by both serving size and container size.\n\nAdministration officials said an economic analysis indicated the new labels could bring between $20 billion and $30 billion in benefits. Officials didn't break those numbers down, but presumably much of the benefit would come from reduced health care expenses. The cost of the new labels was estimated to be about $2 billion over 20 years.\n\nThe food industry, which would be responsible for updating the labels on its products, would bear much of the cost.\n\nAdministration officials said widespread obesity was one of the primary reasons for the update. While acknowledging that the new labels alone would not solve the epidemic, they said they believe they could help curb it.'"

            "title": "Obesity declared a disease by U.S. medical group, millions affected",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The American Medical Association voted Tuesday to declare obesity a disease. The move now defines 78 million American adults and 12 million children as having a medical condition requiring treatment.\n\nThe AMA is the nation's leading organization of doctors. The group voted after debating whether the action would do more to help affected patients get treatment, or would add more shame to the complicated condition.\n\nThe AMA's own experts had offered cautionary advice against the move. But in the end, it decided to extend the new disease status. [Obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) is a condition that affects almost 36 percent of adults and 12 percent of children in the United States.\n\n\"Recognizing obesity as a disease will help change the way the medical community tackles this complex issue,\" said Dr. Patrice Harris, an AMA board member.\n\n## Pressure On Insurers\n\nTuesday's vote is certain to step up pressure on health insurance companies. There is demand for the companies to reimburse doctors for the time-consuming task of discussing obesity's health risks with patients. It should also encourage doctors to direct these patients to weight-loss programs and to monitor their progress.\n\nAnyone with a body mass index greater than 30 is considered obese. The body mass index is a measurement of body fat based on weight and height. A person 5 feet 4 inches tall weighing 175 pounds has a BMI of 30. For a person 6 feet tall, a weight of 221 pounds equals a BMI of 30.\n\nMedicare already covers the costs of \"intensive behavioral therapy\" for obese patients. It also pays for surgery for those with additional health conditions. The federally funded program insures an estimated 13 million obese Americans who are over 65 or disabled. But not all private insurers cover such obesity treatments.\n\nInsurers in the California Association of Health Plans cover many services to treat medical conditions associated with obesity, said chief executive Patrick Johnston. Those services include bariatric surgery, an operation to reduce the size of the stomach.\n\n## Obliged To Diagnose And Discuss\n\nThe AMA's decision means physicians now have an obligation to diagnose obesity and recommend treatment. That should encourage more primary care physicians to talk about weight with their patients. Studies have found that more than half of obese patients have never been told by a doctor they need to lose weight.\n\nDoctors are reluctant not only because they don't want to offend their patient, but they may also be unwilling to start a lengthy conversation for which they won't be paid. Past AMA documents have referred to obesity as an \"urgent chronic condition,\" a \"major health concern\" and a \"complex disorder.\" The vote now lifts obesity above the status of a health condition or disorder.\n\n\"As things stand now, primary care physicians tend to look at obesity as a behavior problem,\" said Dr. Rexford Ahima of the University of Pennsylvania. \"This will force primary care physicians to address it, even if we don't have a cure for it.\"\n\nThere has been a steep 30-year run-up in Americans' weight. The resulting tidal wave of expensive health problems like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease has been an area of growing public concern. Treatment of such obesity-related diseases drives up the nation's medical bill by more than $150 billion a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That figure could rise by an additional $550 billion over the next 20 years, a recent Duke University study concluded.\n\n## \"A Double-Edged Sword\"\n\nThe AMA argued that recognizing obesity as a disease could lead to new treatments. The Food and Drug Administration, which has approved just two new prescription weight-loss medications since 1999, could face increased pressure to approve new obesity drugs. That could spur new drug development and more widespread prescribing by physicians, the council noted.\n\nLabeling obesity a disease also might boost support for prevention programs such as physical education and reforms to school lunch, the AMA added. It could also lead to employers covering obesity treatments for their employees. Companies could be less able to discriminate on the basis of body weight, the AMA suggested.\n\nBut the council also said that making obesity a disease could deepen the stigma associated with being overweight. It could doom some patients to endless nagging - even if they were otherwise healthy or had lost enough weight to improve their health.\n\nIt might also shift focus toward expensive drug and surgical treatments and away from healthy diets and regular exercise, the AMA wrote.\n\nDr. Daniel H. Bessesen, an obesity expert at the University of Colorado, called the AMA's shift \"a double-edged sword.\" While the label change may reflect \"a growing awareness that obesity is not someone's fault,\" he worried that the term disease may make people feel ashamed. People who are obese don't need to feel any more shame, he added. '"

It has since mushroomed into a campaign that has pulled in thousands of writing tools - some used but most new - from local schools, businesses and churches.\n\n## Collect, Deliver And Distribute\n\nWith the help of Kim Oppenheimer, who runs the organization Right-to-Write, Kyle's pencils have reached people in impoverished areas of Ethiopia, Panama and Haiti, and other far-flung countries.\n\nAt a local elementary school this month, Kyle moved boxes crammed with pens, pencils, crayons, markers and mechanical pencils with his mom's help. The month-long pencil drive yielded an impressive haul: 3,790 writing tools.\n\n\"Children giving to children is really valuable,\" Oppenheimer said, praising Kyle's ability to appeal to fellow teenagers, and to motivate students in lower grades to be part of the project.\n\nThe idea behind her one-person organization is simple: People learn about her mission from her website, then mail in or hand-deliver pencils to her. She packs them, fitting around 200 pencils in sealed bags, then hands the packages to travelers heading for developing countries, who carry them in their suitcases. When they arrive at destinations off the beaten track, often on humanitarian trips, the travelers themselves deliver the bags of pencils.\n\nOppenheimer said she has managed to send pencils to schools, hospitals and orphanages in Mexico, Brazil, Liberia, Namibia, India and Vietnam.\n\n## \"It's A Simple Idea\"\n\nKyle, a soft-spoken athlete who hopes to become an architect, said the idea to help came around this time last year, as he left volleyball practice and noticed school janitors sweeping up discarded pencils. Later that summer, the rapid spread of the deadly Ebola virus put a spotlight on hardships faced in West Africa, where the outbreak was centered.\n\n\"There was a desperate need for any kind of help,\" he said, \"and that's what made me think, 'Wow, not only do these people need vaccines and help, but they need something to start a foundation with ... they need to learn.'\"\n\nHe researched organizations where he could be a volunteer and discovered Right-to-Write, run by Oppenheimer, a special-education teacher who has traveled extensively.\n\n\"It's a simple idea, and works so easily,\" Oppenheimer said. \"When any traveler is going overseas, for the most part, you can fit that bag into your suitcase, like a hardcover book.\"\n\n## The Need Was There\n\nShe said she came up with the idea when volunteering with a medical mission to Peru in 2005. She had taken a suitcase of clothing to donate, but soon realized that people wanted her pen. \"Even the nurses wanted my pen as I walked around the hallway,\" Oppenheimer said.\n\n\"I figured if I hadn't realized there was such a need, that many other people hadn't as well,\" she said. The group began three years after her Peru trip, and to date, she has collected more than 80,000 pencils.\n\nKyle reached out last summer and \"was super interested and energetic,\" Oppenheimer said.\n\n## No Shortage Of Donations\n\nSince he started his drives, the donations have been pouring in from local businesses, churches and schools. At schools, he speaks to students during assembly and tells them students just like them need pencils.\n\nThe recent elementary school drive that netted more than 3,700 writing implements was the biggest to date. Throughout February, students dropped pencils and markers into shoe boxes outside classrooms and the cafeteria.\n\nKyle took them home and said he planned to pack them in the sealed bags and bring them to Oppenheimer so she could coordinate their delivery.\n\nAs for the elementary students, the act of giving has made them think about how hard life can be in other countries. It led them to reflect on the reality that an everyday item like a pencil that we might see as expendable can be so needed by other children around the world.\n\nChristopher Bacchioni, a fifth-grader, said he donated \"to help people in need.\"\n\nHe can imagine children \"being happy because they can write now, that they don't have just one pencil to use all year,\" he said. \"They can have a few.\"'"

            "title": "Pope brings spotlight, hope to impoverished Harlem school",
            "text": "\tNEW YORK - The East Harlem block that Pope Francis will visit deserves a blessing more than most places in New York City.\n\nRat poison signs are posted in the soil outside one of two housing projects that flank Francis' destination, Our Lady Queen of Angels School. Remnants of dog walkers who failed to scoop dot the sidewalk on one end of the block. Overall the scene is far from the splendor of St. Patrick's Cathedral or the hushed reverence of the Sept. 11 memorial, both of which the pope will also visit.\n\nOur Lady Queen of Angels sits at the heart of a predominantly Latino and black neighborhood. Francis chose to come to the school on Sept. 25 in large part because most of its students are immigrants and underprivileged. They reflect the population that the pope, who is deeply concerned with poverty and the challenges of immigration, sees as most deserving of attention and assistance.\n\n## A Neighborhood That Has Escaped Changes\n\nThe area surrounding the school has been overlooked by the change that has spread across much of Harlem. Depending on one's point of view, its unchanged character can be seen as a good or bad thing. While much of Harlem has been revived and cleaned up, many longtime residents have been pushed out by rising rents. The feel of many neighborhoods has changed as new, wealthier outsiders, often white, have moved in.\n\n\"That's why I liked this neighborhood - it wasn't like the new Harlem,\" said Sherwin Robinson, who moved onto the block a year and a half ago. He will have a front-row seat to the papal visit from the steps of his brick apartment building directly across from the school.\n\nOur Lady Queen of Angels is one of six Catholic elementary schools in Harlem and the South Bronx. These days, Catholic schools - seen by Pope Francis as essential to his mission of serving the poor - are facing extraordinary challenges.\n\nNew York has lost more than 50 Catholic schools since 2011 because of shifts in population, competition from free, privately run charter schools, and other factors.\n\n## Visit Bodes Well For Catholic Education\n\n\"I hope this changes the conversation about urban Catholic education in America,\" Kathleen Porter-Magee said of the papal visit. Porter-Magee is superintendent at the Partnership for Inner-City Education, which manages Our Lady Queen of Angels and five other schools. \"I think the conversation in the last decade has been one of pessimism,\" with many thinking that schools closing was unavoidable, she said. \"I think we are really at a renaissance right now, where everybody, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, realizes these are institutions which serve a unique and important need. I believe his visit will help shine a spotlight on them.\"\n\nThe Harlem school has 290 pupils, from prekindergarten to eighth grade, most of whom are from poor families.\n\nAt the Vianel Beauty Salon across the street, the women washing, coloring and styling their customers' hair hope the visit also shines a spotlight on the loss of Our Lady Queen of Angels Church, which operated adjacent to the school. It was shuttered in 2007, and dozens more have been closed or merged with others since then in the face of diminishing congregations and other factors.\n\nLili Garcia was 17 when she married the love of her life, Junior, in the church 54 years ago. On a recent afternoon, she was missing the church and her husband, who died a year ago.\n\nGarcia held a black-and-white photograph of the wedding couple, she in a puffy white dress, Junior in a rented tuxedo. She clutched it to her chest and wept.\n\n\"It is emotional for me,\" Garcia said of the papal visit to the neighborhood.\n\n## Pope To Meet Students, Refugees, Immigrants\n\nIn addition to meeting a few pupils selected by lottery, Francis also will visit with dozens of refugees and immigrants while at Our Lady Queen of Angels. They will include several youths who were among the wave of unaccompanied minors who have entered the United States.\n\nGarcia and her friends who run Vianel have been planning for the visit for weeks. Garcia pulled out a folder stuffed with Spanish-language newspaper clippings about Francis, which she plans to post on the walls and windows of the shop as the day of the visit draws near.\n\nVianel Garcia, who runs the salon, and her mother, Amparo Duarte, spoke of the balloons they planned to fly outside the little shop on the big day and of the party they planned in the salon for people hoping for a glimpse of the pontiff.\n\n\"I get goose bumps just thinking about it,\" Duarte said.\n\nNot everyone on the block is caught up in papal excitement, however. Danny Sheeri, who works at a plumbing store a few doors up from the beauty salon, just shrugged when asked about the visit.\n\n\"I'm worried about business - why do I care about the pope?\" Sheeri said as he puffed on a cigarette.\n\n## Bringing Hope To The Community\n\nFor Lili Garcia, though, the visit may be just what the neighborhood and its residents need.\n\n\"I like that finally we have a pope who understands the people,\" she said, peering out the salon window at the school and figuring out the best place to stand for the clearest views. She praised Francis for being humble and for helping the church adapt to the times.\n\n\"It's a big blessing to have the pope,\" Garcia said. \"We know we're going to have a lot of change. We can feel it.\"\n\nDuarte said various friends and relatives will be coming to stay with her at her apartment. Their dream is to catch Francis' attention and perhaps draw the famously sociable pontiff across the street for a blessing, maybe a hug or perhaps some Spanish-style chicken and rice.'"

            "title": "Safety net keeps many Americans from falling into poverty, Census shows",
            "text": "b\"WASHINGTON - New numbers measuring poverty in America show the power of government programs to keep households out of poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the government agency that counts the country's population.\n\nMore than 50 percent of senior citizens in the U.S. would fall below the poverty level without the monthly Social Security checks they receive. Instead, just 14.6 percent do. Food stamps cut the rate of poor people of all ages by about 10 percent, and even more among those under 18. The number of children living in poverty goes down by more than a quarter thanks to tax credits, many of which help the working poor.\n\nThe poverty level was $23,624 a year for an American family of four in 2013. A family living with less is considered poor. The poverty level is based solely on income. But the Supplemental Poverty Measure, released this month, factors in government help. This Measure adjusts for the value of help from programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (also known as welfare), Social Security and food stamps.\n\nThese and other federal programs are called the safety net.\n\n## By The Numbers\n\nThe number also factors in the cost of living and medical costs in different areas of the country. In expensive areas such as Honolulu, Hawaii, Washington, D.C., and parts of California, with high rents and real estate costs, a family earning $30,000 a year, or even a bit more than that, is considered poor.\n\nThe official rate of Americans living below the poverty level in 2013 was 14.6 percent, or 45.8 million U.S. citizens. The supplemental poverty rate was higher at 15.5 percent, equal to 48.7 million Americans.\n\nWhile it is difficult to tell how much the government programs reduced poverty in each state, it is possible to calculate to what extent which people in each state benefit.\n\nThirteen states and the District of Columbia were poorer after government help was factored into the poverty rate than they were under the official number. California had the biggest difference. The other states were Hawaii, New Jersey, Florida, Nevada, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Alaska, New York, Illinois and the District of Columbia.\n\nPoverty rates were lower in 26 states under the Supplemental Measure than under the official number. New Mexico, Mississippi, Kentucky, West Virginia, Montana, Idaho, South Dakota and Oklahoma had the biggest differences.\n\nThe Census Bureau's numbers show how much the different programs help reduce poverty, and calculate what the poverty rate would have been without the help of government programs. Without Social Security, the rate of poverty among all Americans would have been nine percentage points higher.\n\n## Tax Credits And Food Stamps\n\nNational school lunch programs reduced the number of children in poverty by one percentage point. Even small benefits helped. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which pays households an average of about $500, made a dent.\n\nTax credits are a powerful anti-poverty measure. The most well-known is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The credit, for low- to moderate-income working singles and couples, added up to more than $65 billion last year. It's a refundable credit, so taxpayers can get cash back if their taxes are less than expected. Many states have similar credits that are connected to the federal tax credit, but are not included in the federal data.\n\nMississippi claimed more than $1 billion from the EITC. Mississippi taxpayers who received the credit got an average of $2,817 compared to the average for all U.S. taxpayers of $2,300. Taxpayers in Vermont had the lowest average payment, at just under $1,900.\n\nThe effect of benefits on a state's total poverty rate largely depends on the number of residents of the state who receive it. For example, nearly one in four residents of West Virginia is on Social Security. Last year, West Virginia received a total of $524 million in Social Security payments, or $282 per capita. Only one in 10 residents of Alaska receives Social Security. In Alaska, Social Security payments totaled $97 million, or $133 per capita.\n\nThe benefits of food stamps also vary by state. States where a high percentage of the population is enrolled, such as Mississippi, saw more than $330 in food stamp payments per capita. In Wyoming, it was less than $100 per capita.\""

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. first lady Michelle Obama announced a U.S. pledge of $70 million to help educate 200,000 adolescent girls in Pakistan.\n\nObama welcomed guests to the White House with the traditional Muslim greeting of \"asalaam alaikum,\" or \"peace be with you.\" She said the money will help Pakistani girls \"fulfill their promise\" to become the next generation of doctors, teachers and entrepreneurs. The money will help build more than a dozen schools, repair hundreds more and provide job training and college scholarships.\n\n\"These girls are all of our girls,\" Obama said. \"I have passion for this issue because I cannot look into the eyes of young women and not see myself and not see my own daughters, and not want the best for them.\"\n\n## Making A Difference For Girls And Women\n\nObama was accompanied Thursday by the Pakistan prime minister's wife, Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif. His daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who praised the first lady's global effort to educate girls, also attended the announcement.\n\nMaryam Nawaz Sharif said Obama has inspired millions of girls around the world. Her daughters, Malia and Sasha, \"could not have a better role model,\" Sharif said.\n\nJoining hands with Obama at one point, Sharif said, \"We shall see about making a difference and we shall not rest until every girl is learning and in school. We shall not rest until every mother is confident that her daughter will have a better life than what she had.\"\n\n## More Than $800 Million In Pledges\n\nThe Muslim country recently promised to double spending on education, enroll more girls in school and provide more female teachers.\n\nThe first lady is leading a government effort to help more than 62 million teenage girls around the world enroll and stay in school.\n\nObama said in the past eight months, the United States has received pledges of more than $800 million for the Let Girls Learn initiative. It includes $350 million from Japan, $200 million from South Korea and $200 million in a partnership with the United Kingdom.\n\n## Ripple Effects Help Communities\n\nSusan Markham is the senior coordinator for gender equality and women's empowerment at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The agency delivers civilian foreign aid and works to end poverty worldwide. Markham said girls are less likely to attend primary, or elementary, school and are more likely to face barriers to get and complete an education. She said educating girls has ripple effects that go beyond helping just the individual.\n\n\"Empowering girls and ensuring them access to quality education has long-term transformational benefits for their future,\" Markham said before the announcement. It also helps their families, the communities and Pakistan's economic prosperity.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and the first lady launched Let Girls Learn this year to help more than 62 million adolescent girls around the world who don't attend school. They have been urging world leaders to join the effort. Since March, the first lady has traveled to Japan, Cambodia and the United Kingdom to promote the program and recognize new partnerships.'"

            "title": "Defense chief shoots down military's last bastion of males-only jobs",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Thursday ordered the military to open all combat jobs to women. He rejected requests by the Marine Corps to exclude women from certain front-line combat jobs.\n\nDeclaring \"we are a joint force,\" Carter said that moving women into these jobs will present challenges. However, he said, the military can no longer afford to exclude half of the population from grueling military jobs. He said that any man or woman who meets the standards should be able to serve. The armed services has 30 days to submit plans to make the historic change.\n\nCarter's order opens the final 10 percent of military positions to women. They now can serve in the military's most demanding and difficult jobs. For example, women will now be able to join special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs.\n\n## Combat Readiness Tops Priorities\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, General Joseph Dunford, is the highest-ranking military officer in the United States Armed Forces. He was formerly the Marine Corps commandant and had argued that the Marines should be allowed to keep women out of certain front-line combat jobs. He cited studies suggesting that mixed-gender units aren't as capable as all-male units. Carter said he came to a different conclusion. However, he added that the integration of women into the combat jobs will be deliberate and methodical and will address the Marine Corps concerns.\n\nDunford did not attend the news conference to announce the change. When asked about Dunford's absence, Carter said he has discussed his decision multiple times with the chairman. In a statement, Dunford said that he had provided his best military advice on the issue. But he said that now, his focus is \"to lead the full integration of women in a manner that maintains our joint war-fighting capability, ensures the health and welfare of our people, and optimizes how we leverage talent across the joint force.\"\n\nWhile noting that, on average, men and women have different physical abilities, Carter said the services must assign tasks and jobs based on ability, rather than on gender. He said that would likely result in smaller numbers of women in some jobs. Equal opportunity, he said, will not mean equal participation in some specialty jobs. But he added that combat effectiveness is still the main goal, and there will be no quotas for women in any posts.\n\n## Only Marine Corps Pushed Back\n\nThe decision comes after several years of study. It will wipe away generations of limits on how and where women can fight for their country.\n\nOnly the Marine Corps sought any exceptions in removing the long-held ban on allowing women to serve in dangerous combat jobs. The Army, Navy and Air Force have moved steadily toward allowing women to serve in all posts. Only the most risky jobs remain closed.\n\nA senior defense official said the services will have to begin putting plans in place by April 1. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nCarter has hinted at this decision for months. In October, he told U.S. troops in Sicily, Italy, that limiting his search for qualified military candidates to just half the population would be \"crazy.\"\n\n## Qualifications Matter Most, Leader Says\n\nHe had given Dunford until the end of October to forward his review on which jobs, if any, should remain closed to women. Dunford had been the only service chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.\n\nCarter had pledged to thoroughly review the recommendations, particularly those of the Marine Corps. However he said he generally believes that any qualified candidate should be allowed to compete for jobs. The senior defense official said that while Carter recognizes there may be difficulties in opening the jobs to women, he has made his decision and all the services will follow it.\n\nAnswering a question from a Marine in Sicily, Carter said, \"You have to recruit from the American population. Half the American population is female. So I'd be crazy not to be, so to speak, fishing in that pond for qualified service members.\"\n\nFor that reason, the defense secretary said, the military should recruit women into as many specialties as possible.'"

            "text": "\tBOSTON, Mass. - About half of millennials believe that America's criminal justice system is unfair, according to a survey released Wednesday by Harvard University. At the same time, few millennials believe that protests over the killings of black men by police will make a significant difference.\n\nIn Baltimore, protests over the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in police custody have turned violent this week. The survey was taken before the current controversy. It polled 18-to-29-year-olds from March 18 to April 1.\n\nAfter Gray's funeral on Monday, rioters in Baltimore looted and burned businesses and clashed with police. In response, Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, deployed the National Guard to keep order, and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake imposed a weeklong curfew, making it illegal to be out after dark.\n\nThis survey suggests that young people are genuinely interested in seeing real change in the criminal justice system, not just rhetoric, or talk, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard's Institute of Politics.\n\n## Even Before Baltimore, Few Thought Protests Would Work\n\n\"What I think they're asking us through this data is to have a meaningful, non-ideological conversation about this,\" he said. \"Even before the violence in Baltimore, you only had a minority of 18-to-29-year-olds believing the protests would create change.\"\n\nThe survey polled over 3,000 millennials across the country.\n\nIt showed about 49 percent of millennials have little or no confidence that the judicial system can fairly judge people without bias for race and ethnicity. Another 49 percent have \"some\" to \"a lot\" of confidence in the judicial system.\n\nThe disparity is more pronounced among black millennials, with 66 percent expressing little or no confidence compared with about 43 percent of white millennials and 53 percent of Hispanic millennials.\n\nBlack millennials also showed much stronger support than their white and Hispanic counterparts for \"Black Lives Matter,\" the protest movement sparked by recent police killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City, and other cities.\n\n## Generation Seems Skeptical About Change\n\nOverall, though, American millennials aren't confident that the movement will be effective in bringing meaningful change. Just 39 percent of those polled believed the efforts would be \"somewhat\" or \"very\" effective.\n\n\"This is a more cynical generation,\" Della Volpe said. \"They're willing to volunteer and participate if they're inspired, feel like it matters and believe it can create change. But right now, they feel like no one is really listening to them.\"\n\nMany of the young people polled strongly supported solutions that the protest movements have highlighted. About 80 percent believe requiring police officers to wear body cameras can be effective, for example.\n\nThe poll also asked young people for their feelings on U.S. foreign policy.\n\nA solid majority of millennials - about 57 percent - supported sending U.S. ground troops to fight the extremist Islamic State group in the Middle East, and a growing number support pre-emptively attacking countries that could be a threat later.\n\nThe survey shows that young adults have a growing desire for more aggressive foreign policy, Della Volpe said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama on Monday launched a non-government program to promote opportunities for men and boys of color. The program won't be paid for by the government, and instead will bring together former elected officials, pro athletes, celebrities and business leaders to find solutions.\n\nIn starting the program, Obama condemned the \"sense of unfairness and of powerlessness\" that leads to such violent eruptions as the Baltimore riots. He also promised to make equality a cause for the rest of his lifetime.\n\n## Building On My Brother's Keeper\n\nThe nonprofit organization, My Brother's Keeper Alliance, is built on a program Obama started last year to highlight and close the gap between minority students and their peers. The goal is to improve minority students' academic performance and help them on their career paths.\n\n\"We are in this for the long haul,\" Obama told a crowd at New York's Lehman College in the Bronx. \"Sometimes there won't be a lot of fanfare. I notice we don't always get a lot of reporting on this issue when there's not a crisis in some neighborhood.\n\n\"But we're just going to keep on plugging away,\" he said. \"This will remain a mission for me and for Michelle, not just for the rest of my presidency, but for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe alliance is a spinoff of the My Brother's Keeper program. It shows Obama using the power of his office to assemble community and business leaders to work on social problems. It's a strategy he has turned to repeatedly as his presidency winds down, to make up for his inability to start new government programs or win funding from Congress.\n\n## Working On Solutions After Baltimore\n\nMonday's pledge came just days after Obama spoke with clear frustration about the circumstances that led to the rioting in Baltimore. He denounced not just the fatal injury to a young black man in police custody, but the larger issues of poverty and lack of opportunity that affect inner cities around the country.\n\nThey are problems for whole communities to solve, he said, and it will take a continuous effort to make a difference.\n\nMany of the presidents who preceded Obama left the White House with a desire to make changes they couldn't accomplish from the Oval Office. President Jimmy Carter set a new standard of activism with his Habitat for Humanity, which builds affordable housing, and global peace work. President George H.W. Bush runs the world's largest organization devoted to volunteer public service, the Points of Light.\n\nIn their footsteps, President Bill Clinton dedicated his Clinton Global Initiative to projects he began in office. They include the fight against climate change and the campaign to improve health care worldwide.\n\n## Taking On Racism And Poverty\n\nJames A. Thurber, a professor of government and director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, says there's a strong impulse on the part of former presidents to finish the work they couldn't do in office.\n\n\"Rather than just establishing a library that shows what they did, they want to continue the work,\" Thurber said.\n\nObama, he said, might be more effective on his chosen cause after he leaves office.\n\n\"He can address racism and poverty, two things that are very closely linked, in a very effective way,\" Thurber said. \"These are big problems in America, and he is in a special position to get people talking about them.\"\n\nThurber added, \"He's likely to be more effective in that way than by trying to pass legislation in trying to deal with them.\"\n\n## Paying Attention To Minority Men And Boys\n\nObama has been gearing up his effort for years, said Joshua DuBois, the former head of Obama's Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Obama worked on healthy families and fatherhood measures in the Senate and started a fatherhood program shortly after becoming president.\n\nObama's concern for men and boys of color \"started long before he was in the White House and will last long after he's closed the doors to that building for the last time,\" DuBois said.\n\nThe effort took on more urgency after the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer. That's when Obama began to talk publicly about the importance of helping men and boys of color thrive.\n\nIn conversations with staffers, Obama has repeatedly returned to the idea that the real problems require a serious, lasting effort, DuBois said.\n\n\"He talks about how we tend to ignore these communities unless it's a time of crisis,\" DuBois said. \"This is the opposite of that. This is him paying attention to those issues not just in the moment but in a sustained way.\"\n\n## Closing The Education And Work Gap\n\nThe new organization aims to build \"a national ecosystem\" to help boys and young men of color. It plans to do this primarily through educational and intervention programs designed to close what Obama called the \"opportunity gap,\" boosting education and employment rates that lag behind those of their peers.\n\nOn Monday, Obama argued that most Americans share the belief that everyone deserves an equal shot.\n\n\"There's a tragic history in this country that has made it tougher for some,\" he said. \"And folks living in those communities, and especially young people living in those communities, could use some help to change those odds.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Officials in Washington, D.C., have rarely paid much attention to the Bureau of Indian Education, a dysfunctional government agency that is responsible for overseeing nearly 200 schools serving approximately 50,000 Native American children in 23 states.\n\nBut now that might be changing.\n\nPresident Barack Obama wants to boost funding for Indian education by $150 million. That includes nearly $60 million to begin fixing dozens of tribal, or Native American, school facilities that have been deteriorating for decades. The request for more money is part of a greater effort by the administration to improve the lives of Native American youth.\n\n## Deplorable Conditions Are \"Totally Unacceptable\"\n\nThe push comes as Representative John Kline, a powerful Republican lawmaker from Minnesota, has sought to highlight the Bureau of Indian Education's management troubles. In the past few weeks, he has held two hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nKline, who recently visited a crumbling tribal school in his home state, is urging his fellow Republicans to support the president's funding plan. He says the money is critical for making sure Native American students can go to school in safe buildings.\n\n\"You've got collapsing roofs, leaking roofs, buckling floors, exposed wires, popping circuit breakers, gas leaks. That's totally unacceptable,\" Kline said. \"You can't be well-educated in my opinion when you're attending school wearing your coat, wearing your mittens and hoping that the blanket keeps out the 30-degree-below-zero air.\"\n\n## Newspaper Detailed Neglect\n\nWashington became interested in the Bureau of Indian Education after a series of newspaper stories reported on the deplorable condition of tribal school buildings. The stories were published in the Minneapolis Star Tribune in late 2014. They urged the Obama administration and Congress to do something about the problem.\n\n\"Kids shivering in thin-walled classrooms or studying under leaky roofs year after year aren't getting the education they need or deserve,\" the newspaper reported. \"With the larger community's visible neglect all around them, they receive the wrong message about the value of education.\"\n\nLast year, the federal government said about one-third of tribal schools were in poor condition. It also said about $1.3 billion would be needed to fix them and another $1 billion would be needed to deal with older maintenance and repair issues.\n\n## Many Schools Should Be Rebuilt\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Education has undergone several reorganizations in recent years. Director Monty Roessel - the agency's 33rd director in 36 years - is trying again to make things better. Roessel recently told lawmakers he believes his effort will succeed where others have failed because he is focused on two key goals: improving school buildings and improving instruction.\n\nRoessel said that if Congress approves Obama's budget request next year, the Bureau will be able to finally fix the neediest schools. He said his agency is now putting together another list of schools, and hopes to release a plan for fixing them sometime this summer.\n\nFifty-eight buildings are currently listed in poor condition, which means it is more cost-effective to replace them than it would be to rebuild them. \"I agree it's one of the biggest frustrations that we have,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Defense also has many schools in need of repair. But it has received a lot more money to fix them. In 2010, the department began a $5 billion effort to fix or rebuild 47 of its 181 schools by 2021, according to the Star Tribune. But the Bureau of Indian Education has gotten just $39 million during the past four years -less than the cost of one of the Defense Department's elementary schools, the Star Tribune reported.\n\n## Upholding Treaties\n\nIn the 19th century, the federal government signed treaties with Native Americans promising that their children would have access to education.\n\nBut the Bureau of Indian Education, part of the Interior Department, has often faltered.\n\nPart of the problem is that there aren't enough staff workers, according to a government report. The Bureau's leaders come and go at a rapid rate, which makes it difficult to accomplish much. There is poor communication within the office and not enough supervision. Complicating things are the poverty and remoteness of many tribal schools.\n\nToday, just about 8 percent of all Native American children attend tribal schools. However, the children that do go to tribal schools trail the performance of Native Americans who attend public schools - as well as the national average - by almost every academic measure.'"

            "text": "\tNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - A South Carolina mayor announced that all patrol officers will wear body cameras after a local police officer was filmed shooting an unarmed man.\n\nNorth Charleston Mayor Keith Summey called the shooting death \"a horrible tragedy.\"\n\n\"There have been two families that have been harmed greatly by what occurred - both the victim's and the officer's family,\" Summey said during a news conference Wednesday. \"Our hearts go out to both of them.\"\n\n## Traffic Stop Turns Deadly\n\nThe former North Charleston officer, Michael Thomas Slager, was arrested and charged with murder Tuesday. The white officer allegedly shot and killed Walter Scott, who was black, during what began as a traffic stop three days earlier.\n\nAt first, Slager, 33, said that during the confrontation Saturday morning, Scott had taken his Taser, a weapon that delivers an electrical shock, and ran with it.\n\nCellphone video taken by a bystander, however, showed that Scott, 50, appeared to be unarmed when he ran away. In the footage, Slager is seen firing numerous shots at Scott's back and criminal charges says that he struck the man \"multiple\" times.\n\nPolice Chief Eddie Driggers said Wednesday that he was \"sickened\" by the video.\n\n## Ongoing Investigations\n\nWednesday's news conference turned chaotic at times, as protesters interrupted officials with chants of \"No justice! No peace!\" They demanded that Driggers answer questions about the investigation, which is being handled by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). The FBI has also said it is investigating.\n\nSummey and Driggers declined to answer specific questions regarding the incident, noting that SLED, and not the city, is leading the investigation. But Summey said that he has not \"seen all of the video,\" which had been turned over to Walter Scott's family and then to police.\n\nThe mayor and the chief said they visited with Scott's family Wednesday morning and pledged a police escort for his funeral.\n\nSummey said they are \"a wonderful, down-to-earth family, a wonderful group of people, and we let them know how we felt about their loss.\"\n\nDriggers added, \"I have been praying for peace for the family and peace for the community.\"\n\n## More Body Cameras Ordered\n\nState police officers arrested Slager on Tuesday and took him to the Charleston County jail, where he is being held. Slager has been fired from the police force, but Summey said that Slager's wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will remain on the city's health insurance plan until after she delivers her baby. \"We think that's the humane thing for us to do,\" he said.\n\nThe North Charleston department ordered additional body cameras Wednesday morning, which would add to the 115 cameras the department already owns. Officers will wear the small cameras, which will record all their actions. However, Summey cautioned that it could take some time before officers would be patrolling with them, because they need to be trained, and the department needs to finish writing procedures for their use.\n\nScott's family praised the arrest Tuesday evening, and an attorney said the family was \"relieved\" that charges were filed against Slager.\n\n\"All we wanted was the truth, and through the process we've received the truth,\" said Anthony Scott, Walter Scott's brother. \"I don't think that all police officers are bad cops, but there are some bad ones out there.\"\n\n## Demonstrating For Justice\n\nThis was the 11th time an officer has shot someone in South Carolina so far this year, according to Thom Berry, a spokesman for SLED, the state agency in charge of the investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, a few dozen protesters showed up outside the North Charleston city building carrying signs and shouting protest chants.\n\n\"We're out here for justice, we're out here because black lives matter,\" 21-year-old Jeremy Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said he was upset, but not surprised, by the video showing Scott's killing.\n\n\"This is not just about justice for Charleston. It's about justice for Mike Brown, it's about justice for Eric Garner,\" Johnson said. \"It's about justice everyone.\"\n\nMichael Brown was an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot and killed by a white police officer over the summer. Eric Garner was an unarmed black man who died in New York City after a white police officer put him in a chokehold. Both deaths set off protests coast to coast and a national soul-searching over how white police officers treat black people.\n\n## \"The System Is Our Enemy\"\n\nIn North Charleston, the protesters - vocal but relatively small in number - insisted that Scott's shooting was a symptom of bigger and deeper problems in local policing. However, they stressed that demonstrations must remain peaceful.\n\n\"The system is our enemy - not these individual officers,\" Pastor Thomas Ravenell said. \"We cannot change the law by breaking the law.\"\n\nFormer South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, now a United States congressman whose district includes parts of North Charleston, stopped by the demonstration. He spoke with local ministers about the shooting, which he called \"unfathomable.\"\n\nSanford said it was too soon to discuss passing new state laws regarding body cameras and policing reform, but he praised local officials for swiftly charging the officer.\n\n\"As the mayor said, right is right and wrong is wrong,\" Sanford said. \"We all live with the decisions that we make, and so will this officer.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. will do everything it can to help Nigeria find nearly [300 teenage girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls). The girls have been missing since they were kidnapped from school three weeks ago by a terror organization that has threatened to sell them into slavery.\n\nObama said the Nigerian government has accepted help from the U.S., and a team of experts will be sent immediately to the African nation.\n\nThe immediate priority is finding the girls, Obama said, but that the extremist group, Boko Haram, must also be dealt with.\n\n\"In the short term our goal is obviously is to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies,\" Obama said. He spoke in an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show. They were some of his first public comments about what he called a \"terrible situation\" in the West African nation.\n\n\"But we're also going to have to deal with the broader problem of organizations like this that ... can cause such havoc in people's day-to-day lives,\" Obama said of Boko Haram.\n\n## 276 Girls In Captivity\n\nThe brazen April 15 kidnapping has sparked international outrage. There also have been increasing demands for Nigeria to spare no effort to find and free the girls before they can be sold into slavery or harmed.\n\nNigeria's police have said more than 300 girls were taken by force from their high school in the country's remote northeast. Of that number, 276 remain in captivity and 53 managed to escape.\n\nObama said he was glad the Nigerian government was accepting help from U.S. military and law enforcement advisers.\n\n\"Obviously, what's happening is awful, and, as a father of two girls, I can't imagine what their parents are going through,\" he told CBS News in an interview. Obama's daughter's, Malia and Natasha, are aged 15 and 13.\n\nObama said the U.S. has long sought to work with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram. Boko Haram, which means \"Western education is sinful,\" is an Islamist extremist group that believes in a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. It forbids anything Western, including voting in elections and a secular, non-religious education, and doesn't believe girls should go to school at all.\n\n\"You've got one of the worst regional or local terrorist organizations in Boko Haram in Nigeria. They've been killing people ruthlessly for many years now and we've already been seeking greater cooperation with the Nigerians,\" Obama said.\n\n## U.S. Sending Experts To Nigeria\n\nThe Nigeria government has been unable to rescue the girls. And that \"may be the event that helps to mobilize the entire international community to finally do something against this horrendous organization that's perpetrated such a terrible crime,\" Obama said.\n\nThe U.S. is sending experts who are skilled in intelligence, investigations, hostage negotiations, information sharing and victim assistance. It will also send officials with expertise in other areas, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.\n\nNo U.S. armed forces are being sent, Carney noted.\n\nObama made his comments during a series of television interviews conducted in the White House Rose Garden. He spoke shortly after the Senate passed a resolution urging the girls' safe and immediate return. Some lawmakers also observed a moment of silence on the Capitol steps calling for their release, and dozens of people also protested outside the Nigerian Embassy in Washington.\n\nAll 20 female senators urged Obama in a letter to pursue severe international sanctions, or punishments, against Boko Haram. A smaller group of mostly male senators urged Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to address the root causes of unrest in his country.\n\n## \"A Greater Effort\" Needed\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. had been in touch with Nigeria \"from day one\" of the crisis. But repeated offers of U.S. assistance were ignored until Kerry got on the phone Tuesday with Jonathan.\n\nKerry said Nigeria apparently did not want outside help, but now realizes that more needs to be done than it is able to do.\n\n\"I think now the complications that have arisen have convinced everybody that there needs to be a greater effort,\" Kerry said at a State Department news conference. \"And it will begin immediately. I mean, literally, immediately.\"\n\nA statement from Jonathan's office said the U.S. will send \"security (experts) to work with their Nigerian counterparts in the search and rescue operation.\" The statement added that Nigeria's security forces are working at \"full capacity\" to find the girls and welcomes the addition of American anti-terrorist \"know-how and expertise.\"\n\nNigeria's Islamic extremist leader, Abubakar Shekau, has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and has threatened to sell the girls. Shekau also warned that Boko Haram will attack more schools and abduct more girls.\n\nThe State Department on Tuesday warned U.S. citizens against traveling to Nigeria.'"

            "title": "In historic race, former dictator wins Nigeria's presidency",
            "text": "\tKADUNA, Nigeria - In a historic moment for Africa's most heavily populated country, former dictator Muhammadu Buhari has won Nigeria's presidency. His win marks the first time in 16 years of democracy that an opposition candidate has defeated a sitting president.\n\nBuhari, 72, will assume power in Africa's richest nation at a time of crippling uncertainty. Public revenue has been shrinking because of the falling price of oil and the Boko Haram insurgency threatens the country's northeast. Buhari has presented himself as a populist who stands apart from a political class known for its expensive tastes and high-profile corruption scandals.\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan called his rival to congratulate him Tuesday night, according to members of Buhari's party. That message could be an important step toward limiting post-election violence. About 1,000 people were killed in disputes over the 2011 presidential contest.\n\nFor years, it appeared to many here that Jonathan's People's Democratic Party would rule Nigeria for the foreseeable future, thanks in part to the use of electoral fraud. A sense of futility wore on Nigerians, particularly in the country's embattled north, where for years Jonathan neglected the mounting insurgency and did little to develop the country's poorest communities.\n\n## A Country Divided\n\nAlthough a former dictator is an unlikely messenger of democracy, Buhari, a northerner, responded to what many Nigerians have been pleading for. He is a retired general who has promised a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign. He also has a plan to end widespread corruption, even if its details are still vague at this point.\n\nMostly, however, Buhari is renowned for his opposition to the ruling party - this was his fourth run for president in 12 years. Before now, he had never come close. By the time he gave his victory speech in Abuja, the capital, commentators on Nigerian television channels were talking about a \"new Nigeria.\"\n\nWhile many Nigerians celebrated the opposition victory, some members of Jonathan's party were embittered. In one of Tuesday's most dramatic moments, former government minister Peter Godsday Orubebe, who was sitting onstage during the official announcement of results, began accusing the electoral commission's director of bias.\n\nIt was an early sign of the political divisions that Buhari will be confronted with when he takes office on May 29. The country is also divided by religion and geography - Jonathan is a Christian from the south while Buhari is a Muslim.\n\nPeople in this country of 170 million have waited anxiously since Saturday's vote for both the results and the public reaction to them. Supporters of each major party have threatened violence if their candidate loses. The military has been dispatched to areas of concern in preparation for unrest. With Buhari's victory, many worried in particular about the Niger Delta, Jonathan's birthplace, which has a history of violent activity.\n\n## \"We Need Change\"\n\nIn the northern state of Kaduna, people celebrated in the streets, dancing, performing tricks on their motorcycles and screaming, \"We need change.\" They listed their expectations now that their party had finally won.\n\n\"The power supply will be constant,\" said Ibrahim Abu Bakar, 45.\n\n\"Boko Haram will be defeated,\" said Bello Mohammed, 30.\n\n\"Buhari will take care of unemployment,\" said Nurudeen Mukhtar, 27.\n\nBuhari has lived in Kaduna for the better part of 30 years, since his military regime was overthrown in a coup. His faded two-story home was dark Tuesday night, but a guard invited a journalist to walk around.\n\n\"Look at that old car - that's his only car,\" said Sergeant Garba Abdullahi, who had been posted at Buhari's gate by the Nigerian military. \"He is a man of the people, not like the corrupt guys.\"\n\nIn spite of the overwhelming expectations, it will be an enormous challenge for Buhari to implement rapid reform.\n\n\"Nigerians expect to see immediate change. They expect to see corruption end right away, but corruption is an institutional problem here - it is a way of life,\" said Idayat Hassan, director of Nigeria's Center for Democracy and Development.\n\n## \"A Converted Democrat\"\n\nDuring his rule from 1984 to 1985, Buhari attempted to crack down on those he saw as guilty of corruption and other crimes. He set up military courts that sentenced hundreds of suspected criminals and allegedly crooked politicians to prison, actions that some viewed as necessary but many others considered repressive. He also limited the news media's freedom.\n\nNigeria has evolved since Buhari's regime, however, and it appears he has, too. Buhari has traded his pressed green military uniform for a traditional flowing robe. In a speech in London last month, he described himself as \"a converted democrat who is ready to operate under democratic norms.\"\n\nBuhari has been deeply critical of Jonathan's failure to defeat Boko Haram, which has grown steadily since 2009 in the absence of a coordinated military campaign, killing at least 10,000 people. Buhari has played up his background as \"a military man,\" suggesting that he will reform the country's security forces.\n\nIn the past two months, a military operation involving Niger, Cameroon and Chad has chased the Boko Haram rebels from many of their strongholds in the north. However, Buhari will now have to ensure the rebels are flushed from their rural hideouts.\n\n\"Boko Haram has been driven out of certain towns - but they haven't been defeated,\" said former U.S. ambassador John Campbell.\n\n## A Congratulatory Call\n\nJonathan surprised many here by conceding the election and then making a congratulatory call to Buhari. The election had been postponed for nearly two months, leading many to fear that Jonathan might resort to electoral fraud.\n\nBefore the polling, Jonathan announced in a radio broadcast that Nigerians should \"graciously accept\" the election outcome.\n\n\"My sense is that demonstrations will take place, but the level of violence won't be much,\" said Chom Bagu, an expert on conflict resolution.'"

            "text": "\tIn the midst of this year's wars, horrors and treason, it will be difficult for the Nobel Peace Prize committee to find a worthy laureate.\n\nWhere on the planet can a man, woman or organization be found to have reduced the bloodshed and cruelty? The world has witnessed violence in the usual locations as well as new places.\n\nPoliticians in the Middle East failed this year and last year to stop the killing and harming of soldiers and citizens. The Middle East is a region that has seen fighting between Israel and Palestine, as well as a civil war in Syria. It is unlikely that a political diplomat will be named a winner when the prestigious Nobel is announced in Oslo, Norway, on Friday.\n\n## Diplomats And Popes\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, the top diplomat from the U.S., was unable to bring peace to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He attempted to have peace talks between the two sides but could not resolve the fighting. The conflict goes back a long time and recently there was deadly destruction in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe 4-year war in Syria has not ended either. Lakhdar Brahimi, a diplomat for the United Nations (U.N.), tried to bring an end to the Syrian war. The U.N. is an international organization dedicated to keeping peace around the world. As a diplomat, Brahimi held peace conferences to bring the two sides together to discuss a deal, but these did not work. He quit in May. His replacement, Staffan di Mistura, hasn't even managed to bring about another peace conference.\n\nThere appear to be no politicians who are inspiring as previous laureates of the Nobel Peace Prize, such as South Africa's Nelson Mandela (1993 peace laureate) or Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev (1990) or former U.S. President Jimmy Carter (2002). The deadline to submit a nomination was Feb. 1.\n\nNor did any religious leader make a noticeable contribution to world peace. Pope Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, was nominated by the Argentinian parliament. Pope Francis is from Argentina. He has boldly guided the Catholic Church toward returning to a ministry focused on the plight of the poor. In his personal life, he has avoided fancy possessions for a more humble lifestyle and wardrobe.\n\nYet, Pope Francis has only been in office for 19 months. An earlier pope who was also dedicated to peace, John Paul II, led the Catholic Church for 27 years and was not recognized by the Nobel Committee.\n\n## Whistleblowers And Protesters\n\nControversial actions have led at times to some people receiving a Peace Prize. In the past, protesters and whistleblowers - people who reveal secrets about the government - have received a Nobel. But most of this year's known controversial nominees have already been passed over.\n\nFormer U.S. Army analyst Chelsea Manning is serving a 35-year prison sentence for giving classified government documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. Manning's act was praised by some as revealing suspicious government behavior but denounced by others as an act of treason, or betraying the country.\n\nAlso, a former employee of the U.S. government, Edward Snowden, is charged for leaking secrets about the government. Snowden is currently a fugitive in Russia. Similar to Manning, Snowden is saluted and hated in nearly equal measures.\n\nProtesters nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize include a Russian musical punk band called Pussy Riot. They are a rare voice of protest in a country ruled by the strict Russian President Vladimir Putin who has arrested them for their rebellion. Pussy Riot was nominated in previous years but not chosen.\n\nDespite the lack of obvious deserving recipients, there were a record-breaking 278 nominations this year. It is up by 19 from last year's previous record. Among the nominees are 47 organizations. The Nobel Committee keeps this list secret for 50 years, but nominating individuals and agencies often disclose their nominee to the public.\n\n## Malala Or Mukwege?\n\nWhen there is no individual who stands out, informed speculators have put forward some names of groups as worthy recipients.\n\nThe Peace Research Institute Oslo issues a list of potential winners each year. For 2014, they suggest a Japanese peace group, an independent Russian newspaper, and Snowden, the whistleblower.\n\nJapanese People Who Conserve Article 9 is an organization that wants to keep peace. In Article 9 of Japan's constitution, the country pledges to avoid \"the right of belligerency\" or fighting to solve international conflicts. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to revise the constitution to allow for military defense. He has been in office for nearly two years.\n\nAnother nominee for the peace prize is the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The newspaper has criticized President Putin. It has paid the price with at least six of its journalists murdered since the newspaper was founded in 1993.\n\nOther nominees who also have a chance of winning the prize include activist and Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai. She was shot by the Taliban, a terror organization, because she defied their attempts to prevent girls from getting an education. Another potential nominee is gynecologist Denis Mukwege who works as a doctor for females. He has treated thousands of female victims of violence and torture in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country in Central Africa.\n\n## Newspaper Nominates Kohl\n\nUruguayan President Jose Mujica has also been nominated. He gives away 90 percent of his salary to housing programs for the poor and has legalized marijuana and gay marriage. Another contender for the Peace Prize is Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the top diplomat from the United Nations. He has been praised for bringing attention back to climate change in a world widely distracted by war.\n\nOne potential nominee has long been out of the world's spotlight. The Guardian newspaper thought Helmut Kohl of Germany deserves late recognition. Kohl was the chancellor of West Germany in the late 1980s when the country was still divided. He brought the country together peacefully through pro-democracy movements and skilled diplomacy.\n\n\"Modern-day revolutions rarely end happily,\" the British newspaper noted, giving examples of failed revolutions in Egypt and Ukraine. \"Helmut Kohl was no revolutionary, but the startling revolt that happened on his watch had a happy ending. Reunited Germany is one of today's great success stories, Europe's biggest country, its engine of growth, its biggest exporter, its anchor of stability.\"\n\nWouldn't it be fitting, the Guardian asked, to honor the 84-year-old icon of reunification with the prestigious Nobel Prize almost exactly 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n>UPDATE: Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi awarded Peace Prize\\n>\\n>OSLO, Norway (AP) - Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan and Kailash Satyarthi of India were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their work for children's rights.\\n>\\n>The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the two \"for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.\"\\n>\\n>Malala, 17, is the youngest ever winner of a Nobel Prize. A schoolgirl and education campaigner in Pakistan, she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman two years ago. Satyarthi, 60, has maintained the tradition of Mahatma Gandhi and headed various forms of peaceful protests, \"focusing on the grave exploitation of children for financial gain,\" the Nobel committee said.'"

            "text": "\tSAN FRANCISCO - In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school decided to require students to wear a uniform. On the shirt in small letters is emblazoned the school's motto, \"Tomorrow's Leaders,\" around the image of a gopher, the campus mascot.\n\nOne parent objected to the uniforms and eventually sued. She contended that they violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, which allows people the freedom to speak their minds. It also ensures freedom from being made to say something against one's will.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling Friday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely agreed with her. The panel said the words \"Tomorrow's Leaders\" potentially violated students' right to free speech, and the uniform policy must go unless the school district can justify it under a legal standard. That could be difficult to meet.\n\nThe \"policy compels speech because it mandates the written motto, 'Tomorrow's Leaders,' on the uniform shirts,\" wrote Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen, an Obama appointee. That is, it forces students to \"say\" something they may not wish to. Nguyen was joined in her opinion by two judges selected by Republican presidents.\n\n## Court Objects To Exemptions\n\nThe panel also objected to the school's policy of exempting certain students from the uniform requirement. Students wearing the attire of national youth organizations like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts on meeting days are exempt.\n\n\"The exemption explicitly favors the uniforms of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts over all other uniforms,\" the court said. It \"favors the uniforms of 'nationally recognized' youth organizations over those of locally or regionally recognized youth organizations.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against Roy Gomm Elementary School in Reno, Nev., but the ruling would also affect public school uniforms in California and other Western states. Siding with the mother were a student organization and a national legal group that advocates for religious liberty.\n\nEugene Volokh, a professor of constitutional law at the University of California at Los Angeles, represented the mother for free before the 9th Circuit. Public schools, he said, are allowed to enforce strict dress codes. But they may not require people to wear clothing with messages, even if those messages don't seem particularly controversial.\n\n\"What is ideological and what is not is often in the eye of the beholder,\" said Volokh, a conservative First Amendment scholar with libertarian views that make him put great importance on personal liberty. \"You can't be compelled to become a moving billboard for the state's messages.\"\n\nHe said the school motto could be viewed as \"a subtle message that glamorizes leadership and conveys the idea that people think the school is producing leaders.\"\n\n## Cites Supreme Court Case\n\nIn ruling for the mother, the 9th Circuit cited a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New Hampshire law requiring motorists to display license plates with the state motto, \"Live Free or Die.\"\n\nVolokh said the elementary school could still encourage students to wear the uniform. But they also would have to permit similar attire without the motto and the uniforms of other groups in addition to the Scouts.\n\nMary Frudden, the mother who filed the lawsuit, is herself an attorney. She said it is \"vitally important to protect our First Amendment rights.\"\n\n\"I believe we should consider the best interest of every child in our public schools and foster those interests by means which advance independent, creative thinkers - not standardized, uniformed thinkers,\" Frudden said. \"To do anything less is to do our children and our society a disservice.\"\n\nA lawyer for the school district did not respond to a request for comment.'"

On Friday, President Barack Obama will give a speech memorializing those who died. However, he will not use the word \"genocide\" to describe the killings, the White House has announced. The word implies the deliberate and planned killing of a large group of people primarily because of their ethnicity or nationality.\n\nThe decision not to use the word backs down from a previous Obama pledge and sparked anger from activists.\n\n\"The president's surrender represents a national disgrace,\" said Aram S. Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, located in Washington, D.C. \"It is a betrayal of the truth, and it is a betrayal of trust.\"\n\nWhite House officials defended the decision, saying it was necessary to preserve the chance of cooperation with Turkey on Middle Eastern conflicts.\n\n## The Foreign Policy Stance\n\nThe Turkish government has said that the mass killings do not meet the legal definition of genocide. Some members of Congress have also warned that an official shift toward using the word could hurt American foreign policy.\n\nCalifornia has the country's largest population of people of Armenian descent, with more than 200,000 living in Los Angeles County alone.\n\nCalifornia Representative Adam B. Schiff has led efforts in Congress to recognize the genocide. Schiff said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision.\n\n\"How long must the victims and their families wait before our nation has the courage to confront Turkey with the truth about the murderous past of the Ottoman Empire? If not this president, who spoke so eloquently and passionately about recognition in the past, whom? If not after 100 years, when?\" he said in a statement.\n\n## No Offense\n\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan released a statement saying the United States would use the anniversary of the onset of the massacres to \"urge a full, frank and just acknowledgment of the facts that we believe is in the interest of all parties.\" The statement did not use the word \"genocide.\"\n\nA senior U.S. administration official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Obama will mark \"the historical significance\" of the \"Meds Yeghern,\" as the massacres are known in Armenian.\n\n\"We know and respect that there are some who are hoping to hear different language this year. We understand\" their point of view, the official said.\n\nHowever, the official added, \"the approach we have taken in previous years remains the right one - both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present.\" The United States hopes for cooperation from Turkey, particularly in confronting the civil war in Syria, and thus seeks to avoid offending its government.\n\n## Ottoman Empire's Collapse\n\nWhite House national security adviser Susan Rice met Tuesday afternoon with Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. She urged him \"to take concrete steps to improve relations with Armenia\" and to encourage \"an open and frank dialogue in Turkey about the atrocities of 1915.\"\n\nThe United States will send a delegation to Armenia this week, led by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.\n\nThe delegation will also include California Representative Jackie Speier, who said in a statement, \"I intend to call it what it was - I will call it a genocide everywhere I go.\"\n\nRoughly 1.5 million Armenians were killed starting in 1915 amid the chaotic collapse of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWhether to use the word \"genocide\" to describe those killings has been a tricky and emotional political issue for years. Turkish officials base their argument that the killings do not meet the definition of genocide on the claim that no intentional plan to eliminate Armenian populations was involved. Most historians, however, have concluded that the use of the word is appropriate.\n\nU.S. administrations in the past have resisted using the word so as not to offend Turkey.\n\n## Obama's 2008 View\n\nActivists had hoped Obama would break with the past this year, particularly after Pope Francis referred to genocide in a statement just over a week ago.\n\nThe pope and various European leaders have been \"encouraging Turkey to come to terms with its past,\" said Bryan Ardouny, executive director of Armenian Assembly of America. \"We had hoped and expected that President Obama would have done the same.\"\n\nIn the past, Obama has supported using the term to describe the killings. When he was a senator and a presidential candidate, he criticized the George W. Bush administration for not doing so.\n\n\"Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" Obama said in 2008. \"The facts are undeniable. An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama announced Thursday he would place new restrictions on the targeting of terrorists with missiles fired from drones. The unmanned aircraft have been a central piece of his counterterrorism strategy. Their use, however, has been criticized by Congress and international allies because of civilian deaths.\n\nThe president said he would continue ordering lethal [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) strikes to stop potential terror attacks because they are preferable to traditional bombing or sending out large numbers of troops. But a new rule book would hold U.S. authorities to a tougher standard when deciding whom to kill, where, and under what circumstances, White House officials said.\n\nObama made the announcement in a speech that takes stock of America's long battle with al-Qaida, which was behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on U.S. soil.\n\nUnder the new policy, strikes will only be authorized against militants who pose a continuing threat or who are about to launch an attack, aides said. The previous policy allowed drone strikes against anyone who was \"a significant threat.\"\n\n## Drone Attacks Will Be Reduced\n\n\"There must be a near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured\" before any strike is undertaken, a senior White House official said. He was speaking under ground rules that did not allow him to be named.\n\nStrikes against foreign militants will be conducted under the same standard as those against U.S. citizens who have joined forces with al-Qaida, the official said. On Wednesday, the White House said four U.S. citizens have been killed in drone attacks since 2009, including a 16-year-old who was the son of a terrorist suspect.\n\n\"To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance,\" Obama said. He made his address at the National Defense University.\n\nThe result would be a reduction in the frequent, secret drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen that have occurred during Obama's time in office, aides said. At the same time, the president reserved the right to order secret, deadly action anywhere the administration finds a threat from al-Qaida.\n\n## Afghan War Winding Down\n\nObama didn't spell out exactly why he was pulling back on drones. He inherited the program from President George W. Bush and then dramatically expanded it.\n\nHis administration has faced skepticism from Congress, which has held a series of hearings on targeted killing. None of America's major allies has fully embraced the U.S. legal theory of why the strikes are justified.\n\nThe change was made because the core group of al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan is all but defeated and the war in Afghanistan is winding down, aides said. That means there is less reason to hit massed groups in Pakistan. The tactic is known as \"signature strikes,\" where the CIA fired missiles at groups of suspected militants whose identities were unknown.\n\nObama addressed the issue indirectly. \"In the Afghan war theater, we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014,\" he said. \"That means we will continue to take strikes against high-value al-Qaida targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces. However, by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection, and the progress we have made against core al-Qaida will reduce the need for unmanned strikes.\"\n\nMany of the drone strikes that the CIA and the military have launched have been in Yemen. A new pro-American government is making progress against the al-Qaida fighters. U.S. officials said that is making U.S. drone strikes less needed.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama announced Tuesday that the U.S. government will expand a program that helps girls around the world receive an education.\n\nThe new initiative is called Let Girls Learn. It builds on a campaign launched last year by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that aims to provide an education to more than 60 million girls around the world who are not in school. There are already government programs addressing topics like education, leadership, nutrition and protection against gender-based violence and forced marriages.\n\n## \"Every Girl Deserves An Education\"\n\n\"I want to make sure that no girl out there is denied her chance to be a strong, capable woman with the resources that she needs to succeed - that no girl is prevented from making her unique contributions to the world,\" President Obama said. \"Every child is precious. Every girl is precious. Every girl deserves an education.\"\n\nThe president and first lady said this issue is personal for them because they have two daughters.\n\n\"I see myself in these girls. I see our daughters in these girls,\" Michelle Obama said. \"And like all of you, I just can't walk away from them. Like you, I can't just sit back and accept the barriers that keep them from realizing their promise.\"\n\nThe Peace Corps is one group that will work toward the Obamas' goals. The Peace Corps is a volunteer program that was founded by the U.S. government in 1961. It sends U.S citizens abroad to help people in developing countries.\n\n## Uniforms, Fees, Textbooks\n\nThere are many barriers that can prevent girls from getting an education. These include the cost of a uniform, school fees or a lack of textbooks. The Peace Corps will look for ways to overcome these barriers, Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet told reporters Monday night.\n\nThe organization has nearly 7,000 volunteers in more than 60 developing countries already working with communities through training programs, Hessler-Radelet said.\n\n\"Peace Corps volunteers are in a unique position to break down barriers to girls' education at the community level,\" Hessler-Radelet said. \"They speak the local language. They understand the local culture.\"\n\nThe girls education program will start with 11 countries the first year: Albania, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Georgia, Ghana, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Togo and Uganda. More countries will be included the following year, the White House said.\n\n## First Lady Flies To Asia\n\nAs part of the new initiative, Michelle Obama will travel to Japan and Cambodia later this month. She said she will meet with Akie Abe, the wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan. In Cambodia, she said she will meet with Peace Corps volunteers and visit a local school.\n\nPresident Obama's budget recommends $250 million for girls programs worldwide, including education, said Tina Tchen, the first lady's chief of staff.\n\nUSAID already invests $1 billion annually in international education. The organization has helped train more than 300,000 teachers worldwide and provided more than 35 million textbooks and teaching material in a single year, said Susan Markham, USAID's leader on girls and women's issues.\n\n\"Access to education is one of the foremost challenges we face as a global community,\" Representative Kay Granger, a Republican from Texas, said at the White House on Tuesday.\n\n## \"Transformative Power Of Education\"\n\nGayle Smith of the National Security Council said improving education for girls helps a country's economy and can create potential leaders in a country.\n\nCiting the struggles of girls and women in Nigeria and Sudan, Smith said the initiative will also focus on the rights and security of young women worldwide.\n\nNational security adviser Susan Rice said this program comes \"at a vital moment.\"\n\n\"We cannot allow these challenges to rob generations of young women of their future,\" Rice said. \"Together let's make sure that every child, no matter where they're born or what they look like or what their gender, has a chance to forge the future that they deserve, starting with an education.\"\n\nAs for young girls and boys in the U.S., Michelle Obama said she wanted them to \"understand the transformative power of education.\" Obama said they should learn about the sacrifices girls around the world must make to receive an education.'"

            "text": "\tTOKYO - Calling it an \"injustice\" that 62 million girls around the world are not in school, first lady Michelle Obama joined forces with Japan's first lady Thursday. Together, they promised to promote education for girls in developing countries.\n\nMeeting with young women from Japanese universities and high schools, Obama discussed her own journey from a working-class neighborhood in Chicago to Princeton University. It is one of the best colleges in the United States. She encouraged them to pay attention to education and dream big, too.\n\n## Let's \"Change The World\"\n\n\"I'm sitting here with my good friend in Japan (and) with all of you, and we have the opportunity to change the world,\" the first lady said. \"You can do that, too, and so can the 62 million girls out there who aren't getting their education.\"\n\nObama was sitting in a circle with the students, as well as with Akie Abe, the wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy. To earn her master's degree, Akie Abe wrote her thesis on education in Myanmar in Southeast Asia.\n\nJapanese women are among the best educated in the world but often struggle to work their way up the career ladder. The country values long days at work and long nights of drinking with colleagues, making it difficult for women to balance work and family. The Abe administration has made increasing female participation in the workforce a key part of its plan to strengthen the Japanese economy and create new jobs.\n\nObama's solo trip - her first visit to Japan - was part of her effort to promote the Let Girls Learn initiative, which she and President Barack Obama announced earlier this month.\n\n## Brainstorming In Bloom\n\nThe women selected to meet Obama Thursday sat nervously in a guest house decorated with elaborate flower arrangements. They waited to discuss ways to promote education with the first lady. She soon put them at ease, bursting out laughing when realizing, after a lengthy introduction, that she had forgotten to wait for her remarks to be translated into Japanese\n\nIn a country where students and office workers dress in dark suits, Obama stood out in a bold flowery red-and-white skirt suit.\n\nThe first lady was joined on the trip by Michelle Phan, a popular YouTube makeup artist who is also an entrepreneur, a person who creates and runs a business and assumes the risk of whether the company succeeds or not. Phan has a huge following in Asia. She was chronicling the trip on social media.\n\n\"Who agrees it's time to help more girls around the world get the education they deserve?\" Phan tweeted before the event in a message that was retweeted and favorited hundreds of times.\n\nIn another tweet, Phan posted a picture of herself and the American first lady with the caption: \"2 Michelles. 1 cause. #LetGirlsLearn #dreamers\"\n\n## Educating Girls In 11 Countries\n\nTo support the Let Girls Learn program, the president asked Congress for $250 million in new and reallocated funds in his 2016 budget request. Japan, one of Asia's richest countries and the largest donor of aid to other countries in the region, has pledged $340 million for girls' empowerment and education.\n\nFor the U.S. part, Peace Corps volunteers will work with local leaders and families in developing countries to help girls go to school and stay in school. The Japanese equivalent of the Peace Corps - the Overseas Cooperation Volunteers - will do the same.\n\nEleven countries will initially be targeted, including Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in Asia. Obama traveled there Friday night to meet Bun Rany, the wife of the Cambodian prime minister. This was the first trip to Cambodia by an American first lady while her husband, the president, was still in the White House. Obama will also hear from high school students about how they have been helped by community programs.\n\n## Time For An Attitude Adjustment\n\nIn many countries, the barriers to girls getting an education were usually considered to amount to an economic issue. Families could not afford to send girls to school or needed them to work to support the family. Yet Obama said there were other reasons and that it was \"also about attitudes and beliefs.\"\n\n\"It's about whether fathers - and mothers - think their daughters are as worthy of an education as their sons. It's about whether communities value girls simply for their bodies, for their household labor, their reproductive capacities, or whether they value girls for their minds as well,\" she said. \"And if we're being honest with ourselves, we have to admit that these kinds of challenges aren't just limited to the developing world.\"'"

            "title": "Emotional president unveils his plan to control firearms, violence",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - On Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced his plan to tighten control and enforcement of firearms in the United States. When Congress failed to pass the legal changes the president requested, he opted to use his presidential powers to make a change. During the announcement, he was visibly emotional, even wiping tears from his cheek at one point. \n\nObama accused the gun lobby of taking Congress hostage, but said \"they cannot hold America hostage.\" He insisted that it is possible to uphold the Second Amendment while doing something to tackle the frequency of mass shootings in the United States that he said had become the \"new normal.\"\n\n\"This is not a plot to take away everybody's guns,\" Obama said in a ceremony in the East Room. \"You pass a background check, you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules.\"\n\n## Recalling Young Victims Of Violence\n\nObama wiped tears away as he recalled the 20 first-graders killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. He paid tribute to the parents, some of whom gathered for the ceremony, who he said had never imagined their child's life would be cut short by a bullet.\n\n\"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\" Obama said.\n\nAt the center of the president's plan is a more sweeping definition of gun dealers than is currently in place. The administration hopes this new definition will expand the number of gun sales subject to background checks. Under current law, only federally licensed gun dealers are required to conduct background checks on buyers. At gun shows, websites and flea markets, sellers often decline to register as licensed dealers. If they are not licensed, they are not currently required to perform background checks.\n\n## Tightening The Rules On Gun Sellers\n\nAiming to narrow that loophole, the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is issuing updated guidance. The new regulation says that the government should deem anyone \"in the business\" of selling guns to be a dealer, regardless of where he or she sells the guns. To that end, the government will consider other factors, including how many guns a person sells, how frequently, and whether those guns are sold for a profit.\n\nThe White House also put sellers on notice that the administration planned to strengthen enforcement. The stronger enforcement includes deploying 230 new examiners that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will hire to process background checks.\n\nThe impact of Obama's plan on gun violence remains a major question and one not easily answered. Had the rules been in place in the past, they probably would not have prevented any of the recent mass shootings that have garnered national attention. The Obama administration acknowledged it couldn't quantify how many gun sales would be newly subjected to background checks, nor how many currently unregistered gun sellers would have to obtain a license.\n\n## Even 1 Life Saved Is Worth Effort\n\nIn response to criticism, Obama said every time the issue is debated, gun rights groups have the same argument. No matter what is proposed, they claim that it would not necessarily have stopped the last massacre, \"so why bother trying?\"\n\n\"I reject that thinking,\" Obama said, arguing it would be worth it if the measures would prevent even a single gun death. \"We maybe can't save everybody, but we could save some.\"\n\nTo personalize the issue, the White House assembled a cross section of Americans whose lives were altered by the nation's most searing recent gun tragedies. Those affected by recent shootings include former Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona and relatives of victims from Charleston, South Carolina, and Virginia Tech. Mark Barden, whose son was shot to death at Sandy Hook, introduced the president with a declaration that \"we are better than this.\"\n\n## Setting Presidential Policy\n\nObama's package of executive actions aims to curb what he has described as a scourge of gun violence in the United States, punctuated by appalling mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut; Charleston, South Carolina; and Tucson, Arizona, among many others. After Newtown, Obama sought far-reaching, bipartisan legislation that went beyond background checks.\n\nWhen the effort collapsed in the Senate, the White House said it was thoroughly researching the president's powers to identify every legal step he could take on his own. But a more recent spate of gun-related atrocities, including in San Bernardino, California, have spurred the administration to give the issue another look. Obama is seeking to make good on a policy issue that he's elevated time and again but has failed until now to advance.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama unveiled expansive executive actions on immigration Thursday night to spare nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally from deportation. He will refocus enforcement efforts on \"felons, not families.\"\n\nThe moves, affecting mostly parents and young people, marked the most sweeping changes to the nation's immigration laws in nearly three decades. By using executive actions, Obama set off a fierce fight with Republicans over the limits of presidential powers.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Obama defended the legality of his actions. He challenged GOP lawmakers to not focus their energy on blocking his measures. Instead, he asked them to approve long-stalled legislation to take the place of his executive actions.\n\n\"To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill,\" Obama said. The move is seen as a flexing of his presidential powers. Just two weeks earlier his political standing was challenged in midterm elections that saw Republicans gain control of Congress.\n\n##President Could \"Regret\" Actions\n\nAs Obama spoke from the White House, immigration supporters with American flags draped over their shoulders marched on Pennsylvania Avenue carrying signs that read, \"Gracias, Presidente Obama.\"\n\nThe address marked the first step in the White House effort to promote the executive actions to the public.\n\nDespite Obama's challenge to Republicans to pass a broader immigration bill, his actions and the angry GOP response could largely stamp out any chance of an immigration law for the remainder of his presidency.\n\nRepublicans, emboldened by their sweeping victories in the midterms, are weighing responses to the president's actions.\n\n\"The president will come to regret the chapter history writes if he does move forward,\" said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is soon to become the Senate majority leader.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, has refused to have his members vote on broad immigration legislation passed by the Senate last year. He said Obama's decision to go it alone \"cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left.\"\n\n##Measures Still Leave Many Uncertain\n\nWhile Obama's measures are sweeping in their goals, they still leave more than half of the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally in a state of uncertainty. The president announced new deportation priorities. Law enforcement will now be directed to focus its efforts on tracking down serious criminals and people who have recently crossed the border. At the same time, it would specifically place a low priority on those who have been in the U.S. for more than 10 years.\n\nThe president spent months trying to gain a House vote on the Senate bill, before taking action on his own.\n\nObama insisted that his actions did not amount to amnesty.\n\n\"Amnesty is the immigration system we have today - millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time,\" he said.\n\nImmigrants who have been in the U.S. illegally for more than five years but whose children are citizens or permanent residents will benefit most from Obama's actions. After passing background checks and paying fees, those individuals will soon be able to seek relief from deportation and get work permits. The administration expects about 4.1 million people to qualify.\n\n##Mixed Views On Actions\n\nObama is also broadening his 2012 directive that deferred deportation for some young immigrants who entered the country illegally. Obama will expand eligibility to people who arrived in the U.S. as minors before 2010, instead of the current cutoff of 2007. He also will lift the requirement that applicants be under 31. The expansion is expected to affect about 300,000 people.\n\nApplications for the new deportation deferrals will begin in the spring. Those who qualify would be granted deferrals for three years at a time.\n\nImmigration-rights activists gathered at watch parties around the country to listen to the president announce actions they have sought for years.\n\n\"This is a great day for farmworkers. It's been worth the pain and sacrifice,\" said Jesus Zuniga, a 40-year-old who picks tomatoes in California's Central Valley and watched the speech in Fresno.\n\nIn New York City, however, a couple of protesters held \"no amnesty\" signs.\n\n\"We have a lot of unemployed Americans right now, and I don't understand why unemployed Americans can't be hired to do the jobs these illegals are doing,\" said John Wilson.\n\n##Unconstitutional Actions?\n\nThe White House insists Obama has the legal authority to halt deportations for parents and for people who came to the U.S. as children, primarily on humanitarian grounds. As support, officials also mentioned previous immigration executive actions by Democratic and Republican presidents dating back to Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nA senior administration official said the decision to protect parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents is in line with an existing law that allows adult citizens to sponsor their parents for immigration. Obama's plan goes a step further. Now, the sponsoring citizen doesn't have to be an adult.\n\nGOP lawmakers disagree with Obama's claims of legal authority. They called his actions an unconstitutional power grab.\n\nRepublicans are weighing a range of responses, including filing legal challenges and the threat of a government shutdown. One lawmaker - Republican Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama - has raised the specter of impeachment.\n\nGOP leaders have warned against such talk and are seeking to avoid spending-bill tactics that could lead to a government shutdown. They say such moves could backfire, angering many voters and alienating Hispanic voters for the next presidential election.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Opening a new military front in the Middle East, President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time Wednesday night. He called it part of \"a steady, relentless effort\" to root out Islamic State (ISIL) extremists and their spreading reign of terror.\n\n\"We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,\" Obama declared in a prime-time address to the nation from the White House. \"This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.\"\n\nObama also announced that he was expanding air strikes in Iraq and dispatching nearly 500 more U.S. troops to the country. The U.S. forces will assist that country's overwhelmed military. The new addition of troops brings the total number of American forces sent there this summer to more than 1,500.\n\nThe militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Levant is the English term for the region stretching from southern Turkey through Syria to Egypt.\n\nObama also urged Congress to authorize a program to train and arm Syrian rebels. The rebels are fighting both ISIL and Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nObama's plans amounted to a striking shift for the president. He first rose to political popularity in part because of his early opposition to the Iraq war. While in office, he has steadfastly sought to wind down American military campaigns in the Middle East and avoid new wars. He's particularly avoided involvement in Syria. The chaos gripping that country from its continuing civil war has given ISIL space to thrive and move freely across the border with Iraq.\n\nSpeaking on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the U.S., Obama's plans were also an admission that years of American-led war in the Middle East have not silenced the terror threats in the region.\n\n## No Troops Fighting On Foreign Soil\n\nObama insisted that his plan to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" ISIL would not involve returning U.S. combat troops to the Middle East. Even so, he acknowledged that \"any time we take military action, there are risks involved, especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions.\"\n\n\"But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil,\" he added.\n\nThe president's announcements follow a summer of debate at the White House over how to respond to the violent ISIL militants. Administration officials have said they are not aware of a true threat of a potential attack by the militants in the U.S. All the same, they say the group poses risks to Americans and interests across the Middle East. Officials are also concerned that Westerners, including Americans, who have joined the militant group could return to their home countries to launch attacks.\n\nIn recent weeks, the militants have released videos showing the grisly murder of two American journalists in Syria. The violent images appear to have shifted public opinion, which was formerly weary of war. In recent days multiple polls have showed that the majority of Americans support airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe U.S. began launching limited airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq earlier this summer at the request of Iraq's former prime minister.\n\nOfficials said Obama plans to proceed with both the broader airstrikes in Iraq and the strikes in Syria. He'll do so without seeking new authorization from Congress. Instead, he is to act under authorization Congress passed after 9/11 to give President George W. Bush the ability to go after those responsible for the terror attacks. Obama has previously used the authorization to strike against terror targets in Yemen and Somalia.\n\n## Too Little Too Late?\n\nObama said his approach in Syria is modeled after those long-running U.S. counterterrorism efforts. But it is different in important ways, starting with the fact that it marks the first time since 9/11 that a U.S. president has authorized the bombing of terror targets in another nation without seeking permission or at least notifying it in advance.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, praised Obama for acknowledging the \"grave and growing threat\" that Islamic extremists pose. However, he said Obama was coming to that conclusion far too late.\n\n\"He has finally begun to make the case the nation has needed him to make for quite some time: that destroying this terrorist threat requires decisive action and must be the highest priority for the United States and other nations of the free world,\" Boehner said.\n\nAs if to answer the criticism that he has been too cautious, Obama declared of his plan: \"This is American leadership at its best.\"\n\nObama is pushing for funding to train and arm more members of the Syrian opposition. Even before his remarks, congressional leaders were grappling with whether to support that request and how to get such a measure through a fiercely divided Congress.\n\nWhile the CIA currently runs a small program to arm the rebels, the new version would be more robust.\n\n## More Countries Getting Involved\n\nSome of Obama's own advisers pressed him to arm the rebels early in their fight against Assad. But Obama resisted, arguing that there was too much uncertainty about the composition of the rebel forces. He also expressed concern about adding more firepower to an already bloody civil war.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that it was also providing $25 million in military assistance to the Iraqi government to combat ISIL.\n\nThe Treasury Department will also step up efforts to undermine the extremist group's finances. It will seek to cut off the group's outside funding and its access to the global financial system.\n\nThe U.S. has been pressing allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere to help with efforts to weaken the terror group.\n\nFrance's foreign minister said Wednesday that his country was ready to take part in airstrikes against extremist fighters in Iraq if needed. And the German government announced that it was sending weapons and armored vehicles to Kurdish forces in Iraq.'"

The gravesite is marked by an ever-burning flame.\n\nBoth couples placed their hands over their hearts as a bugler played taps near a U.S. flag at half-staff. Then they greeted Kennedy relatives, including some who arrived in Obama's motorcade.\n\n## Medals Of Freedom\n\nThe day of tributes began at the White House, where Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 16 living and deceased Americans. They were honored for contributions in fields ranging from sports and entertainment to science and public service.\n\n\"These are the men and women who in their extraordinary lives remind us all of the beauty of the human spirit, the values that define us as Americans, the potential that lives inside of all of us,\" Obama said.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and film director Steven Spielberg were among scores of people seated in the White House East Room for the ceremony. Obama said giving the medals is \"one of my favorite events every year.\"\n\nKennedy established the modern version of the medal but was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, weeks before he was to honor the inaugural group of recipients. Hundreds of notable figures since have received the honor.\n\nObama said a few words about each recipient.\n\nHe said Clinton's presidency marked just the start of his work to make the world a better place. Obama noted Clinton's post-presidency humanitarian efforts as helping to save or improve the lives of millions worldwide.\n\n\"I'm grateful, Bill, as well, for the advice and counsel that you've offered me, on and off the golf course,\" Obama said to chuckles.\n\nBill Clinton shook hands with Kennedy as a teenager in the Rose Garden the summer before the assassination. He and other high school students in the Boys Nation program had come to Washington.\n\n## Medal Winners Overcame Obstacles\n\nObama also honored the late Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. Ride became a role model for young girls, he said.\n\n\"You can't be what you can't see,\" Obama said. \"Today our daughters, including Malia and Sasha, can set their sights a little bit higher because Sally Ride showed them the way.\"\n\nReceiving the award for Ride, who died last year, was Tam O'Shaughnessy, who was introduced as Ride's life partner.\n\nThe president made a point of highlighting those who had overcome additional obstacles and stigmatization because they are gay, black, female or Asian. He noted that early in her career, Oprah Winfrey's bosses suggested she change her name to something more relatable.\n\n\"It turned out, surprisingly, that people could relate to Oprah just fine,\" Obama said.\n\nObama planned an evening speech at a dinner at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History honoring medal recipients. Among those expected to attend were baseball's Hank Aaron, singer Aretha Franklin, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, activist Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\n\n## Presidents To Come?\n\nKennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, the son of Kennedy's only surviving child, Caroline, was to introduce Obama at the dinner. Caroline Kennedy recently followed her father into public service when she was sworn in as the newest U.S. ambassador to Japan.\n\nOn Friday's assassination anniversary, Obama plans to meet privately at the White House with leaders and volunteers from the Peace Corps program. Kennedy also established that program.\n\nThe Clintons' presence at Kennedy's gravesite was sure to spark speculation about whether Obama has a favorite in the 2016 race to succeed him.\n\nEvery move by the former secretary of state is being looked at for signs of whether she'll run. Vice President Joe Biden is another potential candidate. He attended only the White House ceremony.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - After Tuesday's election, President Barack Obama is limping into his final two years in office.\n\nAll second-term presidents lose considerable power at this mark. But for Obama, this comes amid a political climate so tense that compromise between him and Congress is all but impossible. On Tuesday, the Republican Party, which already controlled the House of Representatives, won a majority of seats in the Senate. The Republican victory only further complicates the Democratic president's ability to deal with a tough list of foreign and domestic policy challenges.\n\nAlthough the U.S. economy is growing at a healthy rate, wages are not rising and the global economy is slowing down. The extremist group Islamic State has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria, even as the U.S. targets the militants with air strikes. The appearance of the deadly Ebola virus in the United States has scared voters and raised questions about whether the White House can handle several crises at once.\n\nNext week, Obama will head to Asia and Australia for meetings, even as Congress returns to Washington to finish its work in a lame-duck session. A lame duck is an office holder who will not be returning to office after the new year. The new Republican-led Senate will begin in January, as will the House of Representatives with a bigger Republican majority. Obama is considered a lame duck because he can't run again.\n\n## Executive Order On Immigration\n\nObama has no plans to compromise with Congress - both the old one or the new - at least on one matter. Aides said Tuesday that he'd sign an executive order to help some of the 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally stay and work in the U.S. Obama had delayed the order earlier this fall, because Democrats feared that angry voters would kick them out of office.\n\nRepublican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said after he won re-election that he and Obama \"have an obligation to work together on issues on which we agree.\"\n\nMcConnell said, \"I don't expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently.\"\n\nHe added, \"He knows I won't, either.\" McConnell is expected to become the Senate majority leader.\n\n\"There would have to be some really exceptional set of events to get people who have shown no interest in cooperating to get something done,\" said Ken Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who studies the presidency. Mayer he said he doesn't think there will be any important new laws passed during Obama's last two years in office.\n\n## Not The Only Unpopular One\n\nMeanwhile, much of Washington and the political world is ignoring Obama and starting to look at who will be the next president. Obama will become \"yesterday's news\" as soon as the 2016 presidential race begins, said New Hampshire State Senator Lou D'Allesandro, who is a Democrat.\n\nD'Allesandro expects that president won't accomplish much in his last two years, because Republicans will stand in his way.\n\nObama enters these final months already hindered by low approval ratings that led Democrats running in close elections this year to keep away from him. Obama spent the last two days leading up to Election Day in meetings at the White House.\n\nBut if he's unpopular, so are Republicans. Vice President Joe Biden argued, perhaps hopefully, that Republicans in Congress will need to compromise with Obama if they want something to brag about in the 2016 elections.\n\n\"We know what we have to get done the last two years,\" Biden said. The White House is \"ready to compromise.\" Biden said he thinks the Republicans might be also willing \"because the message from the people, and I'm getting it all over the country, is they're tired of Washington not being able to do anything.\"\n\nAlthough he may feel lonely, Obama isn't alone in what he faces. The last three presidents to serve two terms - Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush - spent their last two years in office with the opposition party controlling both houses of Congress.\n\n## Can Still Get Some Things Done\n\nAides who worked for those former presidents say a lame-duck president can still pass important laws.\n\nObama and Republicans in Congress share a desire to show voters they can still be effective, said William Galston, a former Clinton adviser.\n\n\"President Obama, like any president, wants to finish strong and leave as much of a legacy as he can,\" Galston said. Since the Republicans are not very popular either, they have good reason \"to show they can do business.\"\n\n\"There is incentive for Obama, if he wants those last two years to be of consequence, to figure out ways to work with Congress,\" said Ken Duberstein, who served as Reagan's chief of staff in his second term. \"He needs to build trusting relationships.\"\n\nThe White House has signaled that some staffing changes are likely. Press secretary Josh Earnest said there wouldn't be any major changes, at least not right away.\n\nSome presidents have felt compelled after midterm elections to publicly fire well-known officials in their government, he said. \"At this point, I don't anticipate that that will happen later this week.\"\n\nObama and Republicans could compromise on different issues, including trade, taxes, immigration changes and investing in the nation's highways and railroads.\n\n\"There are ways to bridge the differences,\" Duberstein said. \"I think there is a fork in the road.\" He said that if Obama isn't willing to compromise, he won't get anything done.'"

            "title": "Obama keeps his optimism in his last State of the Union speech",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - With his presidency coming to a close, Barack Obama urged Americans Tuesday night to rekindle their belief in the promise of change that first carried him to the White House. He declared that the country must not allow fear and division from an election year to risk the progress being made on security and the economy.\n\n\"All the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air,\" Obama said in his final State of the Union address, referring to some of the presidential candidates' speeches. \"So is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.\"\n\nHe said, \"The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It's not even close.\"\n\n## POTUS On Prime Time\n\nThe president addressed lawmakers and a prime-time television audience. In his speech, he hoped to both shape his legacy and influence the outcome of the 2016 election. He defended his achievements as president and implicitly urged the public to elect another Democratic president to build on it. However, he also acknowledged the anxieties of Americans who feel shut out of a changing economy or fear a terror attack.\n\nObama did not directly call out Republicans. Though he sharply struck back at rivals who had challenged his ability to better the country's economy and national security.\n\nIn his most direct swipe at the Republican candidates running to succeed him, Obama warned against \"voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background.\"\n\nHis words were unexpectedly echoed by Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. She was selected to give the Republican response to Obama's address. Haley emphasized how the heated campaign rhetoric about immigrants and minorities from Republican Party front-runner Donald Trump in particular has unnerved some Republican leaders. She called on Americans to resist the temptation \"to follow the siren call of the angriest voices.\"\n\n\"No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome,\" Haley said in her written remarks. These were released before she spoke to the media about Obama's speech.\n\n## Leaving A Legacy Behind\n\nFocused on his own legacy, Obama ticked off a chronology of his domestic and foreign policy actions in office. He discussed how he helped lead the economy back from the brink of depression during the 2007 financial crisis. He also mentioned the aggressive action he took on climate change and how he put an end to the Cold War freeze with Cuba. The trade embargo with Cuba had been in place since the Kennedy administration in 1961.\n\nHe proudly spoke of his landmark nuclear deal with Iran, in which he got Iran to agree to not develop nuclear power to make weapons. However, he made no mention of the 10 American sailors picked up by Iran Tuesday. The Pentagon said the sailors had drifted into Iranian waters after encountering mechanical problems and would be returned safely and promptly.\n\nTackling one of the most vexing foreign policy challenges of his presidency, Obama vowed a robust campaign to \"take out\" the Islamic State group, but chastised Republicans for \"over-the-top claims\" about the extremist group's power.\n\n\"Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger and must be stopped,\" he said. \"But they do not threaten our national security.\"\n\nThe president's words were unlikely to satisfy Republicans, as well as some Democrats, who say he underestimates the Islamic State's power and is leaving the U.S. vulnerable to attacks at home.\n\n## \"I'll Keep Trying\"\n\nObama was frank about one of his biggest regrets. He said he failed to ease the persistently deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\"The rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better,\" he admitted. \"There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\"\n\nHe specifically called for ending the gerrymandering of some congressional districts which swing elections in the direction of a particular political party. He also urged steps to make voting easier and to lessen the influence of money in politics.\n\nKnowing that he cannot get many laws passed in his last year in office, Obama avoided the traditional list of policy proposals. He did reiterate his call for working with Republicans on criminal justice reform and the prison system. He also vowed to keep pushing for action on heated political issues such as curbing gun violence and fixing the nation's fractured immigration laws.\n\nYet Obama was eager to look beyond his own presidency. He cast the actions he has taken as a springboard for future economic progress and national security. His optimism was meant to draw a contrast with what the White House sees as doom-and-gloom scenarios often heard in speeches by Republican candidates.\n\nRepublicans were largely dismissive of the president's address. House Speaker Paul Ryan, assuming the speaker's traditional seat behind the president for the first time, said Obama's lofty, but cliche remarks and \"nostalgic rhetoric may make for nice soundbites, but they don't explain how to\" solve problems.'"

            "title": "Applications for virtual reality still mostly imaginary",
            "text": "\tLAS VEGAS - \"Virtual reality\" is the term for a three-dimensional computer-generated environment, an imaginary world that \"virtually includes\" users. Despite all its possibilities, virtual reality (VR) is still primarily associated with games. Put on a helmet where VR systems are being demonstrated, and chances are you will be immersed in a video game. Most likely you will find yourself in a spaceship cockpit, or driving a racing car or dodging bullets in a shooting game.\n\nSounds like fun, but virtual reality, despite all the hype, is not yet ready for prime time, for video games or anything else. The hardware remains big and clunky, and the typical fast-action VR environment still makes too many people sick to their stomachs.\n\nWhile they work to iron out those problems, VR makers like Oculus are also exploring additional uses for VR other than video games.\n\n## Is That A T-Rex Behind You?\n\nAt a consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week, those who donned the Oculus Rift headset, which resembles ski goggles, were transported to an alternative reality where a menacing T-Rex awaited. If they leaned in, they could almost feel its breath on them.\n\nIn the same demonstration, people were virtually lifted to the top of a skyscraper; if they walked to the edge and leaned over, they could see bustling traffic hundreds of feet below. The effect triggered the fear of heights in more than one show attendee.\n\nIn another demonstration, a fight scene between two robots played out in 360-degree video, inviting users to look left, right and behind them to follow the action.\n\nThe presentation was designed to demonstrate the range of possibilities for VR.\n\n\"We've said from the beginning we're big gamers, and we started Oculus to deliver consumer VR and revolutionize games,\" said Nate Mitchell, an Oculus vice president. \"But it may well end up being that VR is more about film than games.\"\n\n## Technology In Search Of An Application\n\nVR's greatest potential could turn out to be in movies - but it could also turn out to be best suited for video games after all, or for military simulation training. The company is working with outside developers on content for all three formats.\n\nMost Hollywood studios are deeply involved in exploring the possibilities of virtual reality entertainment. The Sundance Film Festival, to be held in Utah this month, said it has selected at least 13 short VR movies for presentation.\n\nThe VR maker Jaunt has developed a 3-D camera that records in 360 degrees so users can make their own virtual reality films. The company has already released two videos of concerts that give users a 360-degree view of the concert stage.\n\n## Business Meetings Via Avatars\n\nAnother company, AltspaceVR, is building virtual reality software for meetings and conferences. In the AltspaceVR app, users appear as an avatar - that is, an image or figure that represents them. The app uses the head-tracking capabilities of virtual reality headsets to determine where a person is looking and how his or her head is moving, and translates that into the avatar's movements. It also simulates being in an actual physical space with other people by allowing users to hear someone better if that person's avatar is closer. Getting really close to someone's avatar lets users whisper.\n\n\"We think VR has this opportunity to be a new communications medium,\" said AltspaceVR Chief Executive Eric Romo. \"There's a lot of things you can do with nonverbal communication inside virtual reality that are not really possible on other platforms.\"\n\nOn the phone, users can't tell whether the person on the other end of the line is paying attention, and in group conference calls, people tend to accidentally talk over one another. AltspaceVR tries to overcome these problems by allowing people to communicate things without talking.\n\n\"In VR, I can have that information - I can see it,\" Romo said. \"So we can communicate in this more natural way than we could on chat or telephone.\"\n\n## VR As A Training Tool\n\nIt will be awhile before companies hold staff meetings via virtual reality avatars - if indeed they ever do. Other workplace uses for VR are more immediate. Dan Ward, co-founder of mobile app development company Detroit Labs, believes the coming year will see various industries use VR for training. For example, VR could be used in combat simulation for the military, or in natural disaster drills for police, firefighters and paramedics.\n\n\"In the past, we've spent billions of dollars re-creating situations for people to train in,\" Ward said. \"But these VR head units are able to trick the mind really well, and we all know that a lot of training is mental, so there's a massive opportunity here.\"\n\nAnother VR headset maker, Sulon Technologies, has developed software that allows users to walk around a life-sized virtual engine. Sulon founder and CEO Dhan Balachand said it could change the way product-design teams work, by allowing them to see products and parts before committing to manufacturing.\n\nThe company also foresees its Cortex headset changing the way people buy cars. Users who put the headset on will see a car materializes before them, and will be able to change its color and add or remove features.\n\n## \"It's Still Early Days\"\n\nAlthough hopes for affordable VR are building, there are not yet any high-definition consumer headsets on the market. While various headset makers, including Oculus and Samsung, have released consumer headsets in limited quantities, these products are still very much in the developmental phase.\n\nWith so few people owning headsets, it is difficult to get anyone to make VR films. Mitchell isn't worried, though.\n\n\"Obviously, it's way too early for a $50 million blockbuster VR film because there's no way to sell it to people yet,\" he said. \"But I think in the next few years we'll get there. It's still early days.\"'"

            "title": "Channeling Facebook into checkbook: Zuckerbergs to donate billions",
            "text": "\tFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, will donate 99 percent of their Facebook stock to charity. Their promised gift would be one of the largest charitable donations ever made. Together, the couple's shares are currently worth about $45 billion. \n\nZuckerberg made the announcement Tuesday in an open letter addressed to the couple's first child, a daughter named Max, who was born in November. Her birth, he said, was the couple's motivation for dedicating their considerable wealth to charitable causes now. He and his wife did not want to wait to \"advance human potential and promote equality for all children.\"\n\n\"I will continue to serve as Facebook's CEO for many, many years to come,\" Zuckerberg wrote, but \"these issues are too important to wait until you or we are older to begin this work.\"\n\nThe money will be channeled into the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a newly formed group that initially will focus on education and health. It was also clear from Zuckerberg's letter that he and his wife had learned lessons from earlier philanthropic attempts and will move in a new direction.\n\nZuckerberg's announcement stands out because of his relative youth - he is just 31 - and the gift's massive size. The donation also comes at a time when the world's wealthiest business leaders seem to be challenging one another to give away their fortunes before they die.\n\n## Following In Some Generous Footsteps\n\nIn 2010, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett publicly launched the Giving Pledge to encourage billionaires to donate the bulk of their wealth to charity. Gates, the former Microsoft leader, has already donated $31.5 billion, mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Buffett has donated more than $22 billion of his Berkshire Hathaway stock and plans to give away nearly his entire fortune.\n\nMore than 130 billionaires worldwide have joined them. Among them is Judy Faulkner, founder of the electronic health-records company Epic, who said she plans to give away 99 percent of her money. Also this year, Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the richest men in the world, said the pledge inspired him to eventually give away his entire fortune, more than $30 billion.\n\nZuckerberg quietly committed weeks ago to this pledge, too. However, his Nov. 9 Giving Pledge letter did not reveal the scale of his intentions.\n\n## First Gifts: $1 Billion Annually\n\nThe Facebook co-founder will start by giving away up to $1 billion a year in Facebook stock for the first three years.\n\n\"He clearly wants to be perceived as a leader of his generation in the same way as Buffett and Gates are theirs,\" said Richard Marker of the New York advisory firm Wise Philanthropy.\n\nThe couple revealed their plans in a lengthy \"letter to our daughter\" published on Facebook, the social network Zuckerberg co-founded while a student at Harvard University. Today Facebook has 1.5 billion monthly active users worldwide.\n\nTheir daughter's full name is Maxima Chan Zuckerberg. She was born just before Thanksgiving, weighing 7 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\n## Using Technology To Change Learning\n\nIn the open letter, Zuckerberg and Chan talked about the potential that technology offers to re-engineer the way children learn.\n\n\"Our generation grew up in classrooms where we all learned the same things at the same pace regardless of our interests or needs,\" they wrote.\n\nZuckerberg and Chan have given $15 million to AltSchool, a for-profit corporation that works to create a network of schools that use technology to personalize instruction. The couple also has given $120 million to traditional public schools and public charter schools in the San Francisco area.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg's first attempt to donate money toward improving education was in itself a learning experience. In 2010, he gave $100 million to remake public schools in Newark, New Jersey, with mixed results.\n\nCritics of that effort said the plan, which called for wholesale changes in the city's public schools, faltered in part because it was a top-down approach. It was crafted by outsiders, not community members who knew the school system's problems firsthand, they said.\n\n## Working With Education Communities\n\nIn their letter to Max, Zuckerberg and Chan talked about learning from mistakes.\n\n\"Your mother and I have both taught students and we've seen what it takes to make this work. It will take working with the strongest leaders in education to help schools around the world adopt personalized learning. It will take engaging with communities, which is why we're starting in our San Francisco Bay Area community.\"\n\nZuckerberg and Chan, a pediatrician and onetime teacher, plan to open a private, tuition-free school for low-income children in East Palo Alto, California. The school will integrate health care and support for families with classroom learning.\n\nAlthough the letter to Max was obviously intended for a wide audience, the couple ended the note in a personal, quiet fashion.\n\nIt was signed simply: \"Love, Mom and Dad.\"'"

            "text": "\tMark Zuckerberg announced an ambitious effort to bring the Internet to billions of poor people earlier this week. Is was the latest move by Facebook's leader to carve out a high-profile role as a tech CEO who can wield influence over public issues.\n\nHe's not the only one of his peers promoting the power of technology to change the world. But the scale and ambition of Zuckerberg's industry alliance to promote global Internet access makes the 29-year-old CEO one of the most prominent advocates for Silicon Valley's unique blend of business and altruism.\n\nStill, critics scoffed on Wednesday, Aug. 21 at what they viewed as self-interest wrapped in noble-sounding words that accompanied the announcement from Zuckerberg and his new Internet.org coalition. And it's not the first time his efforts have run into that criticism.\n\nHelping new populations get online is clearly in Facebook's interest, said longtime Silicon Valley observer Paul Saffo. It also represents a recent trend, he said. Unlike the days when business moguls waited until they retired to become philanthropists, \"now we expect our [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) to be charitable activists.\"\n\n## Hyperloop And Hunger\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk held a press conference to promote his idea for the Hyperloop, a futuristic transportation system that he hopes someone else will build. Google CEO Larry Page spoke at his company's annual software conference in May about using software and data to solve world hunger and other vexing problems. Google is also pursuing its own ideas for delivering cheap Internet service, including a flotilla of radio-equipped high-altitude balloons under its Project Loon.\n\n\"I think we're all here because we share a deep sense of optimism about the potential for technology to improve people's lives,\" Page told the conference goers.\n\nWhile Page more often shuns the public spotlight, Musk and Zuckerberg have both learned to leverage their own celebrity. Zuckerberg drew worldwide attention to his new coalition by announcing it on his personal Facebook page Tuesday night. He also offered himself up for interviews with the New York Times and CNN. CEOs of other companies involved in the effort haven't been widely quoted on the project.\n\nSimilarly, when Zuckerberg launched the advocacy group FWD.us earlier this year to lobby for immigration reform, including policies that help the tech industry, he announced it in a first-person essay in the Washington Post. A number of prominent tech executives and venture capitalists signed on to the FWD.us organization. But it's widely viewed as Zuckerberg's group.\n\n## Two-Thirds Of World Offline\n\nAs it stands now, the Internet.org alliance consists of Facebook and six companies that make mobile phones, smartphone processors and mobile software. They plan to collaborate on efforts to build lower-cost smartphones, make apps that use less data, and create financial incentives for companies to provide telecommunication service in poor areas.\n\nThe alliance doesn't include any telecommunications providers or other Internet companies. Still, one expert said the effort could help by lowering some of the cost hurdles that keep two-thirds of the world's population offline.\n\n\"It's an incremental improvement on technology that's already proven,\" said Richard Bennett at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. While a number of groups are working on Internet access, he added, the problem is so large that it will require a variety of solutions. Others were more skeptical about Zuckerberg's plan.\n\nMany commenters noted the financial interest that Facebook has in delivering ads to an expanding audience. \"And that's really the point here: Don't pretend to be saints. We are not stupid,\" commentator Alexis Madrigal wrote in the Atlantic, paraphrasing one Internet post.\n\nMadrigal also said that getting more people using the Internet also expands the reach of American surveillance efforts.\n\n## \"Everyone Deserves To Be Connected\"\n\nZuckerberg also faced criticism after FWD.us aired television ads that supported legislators who backed immigration reform. In some cases, the ads praised their stance on hard-right conservative issues and the controversial Keystone oil pipeline, which environmentalists oppose.\n\n\"That was an extraordinarily bad idea,\" Saffo said. But, he added, \"I think there's a lot less risk\" in the new effort. \"You don't see anybody demonstrating against Internet access.\"\n\nZuckerberg is one of the wealthiest and most well-known tech CEOs in the world. He has donated $600 million in cash and stock to New Jersey public schools and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in the past three years.\n\n\"With wealth and status come responsibility. And the earlier that he's been successful, the sooner the public expects him to step up,\" Saffo said. \"He's clearly still finding his way.\"\n\nZuckerberg has acknowledged Facebook stands to benefit from putting the Internet within reach of more people around the world. Indeed, its growth rate is slowing in the developing world.\n\nStill, Zuckerberg argued in a position paper: \"The unfair economic reality is that those already on Facebook have way more money than the rest of the world combined, so it may not actually be profitable for us to serve the next few billion people for a very long time, if ever. But we believe everyone deserves to be connected.\"'"

            "text": "\tLAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - Major League Baseball plans to eliminate home plate collisions, possibly as soon as next season but no later than 2015. A collision occurs when a base runner runs into the opposing team's catcher at home plate.\n\nNew York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson made the announcement Wednesday at the winter meetings. Alderson is the head of the league's rules committee. The major factors driving the decision were player safety and concern over [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions), injuries to the brain that can sometimes cause long-term damage.\n\n\"Ultimately, what we want to do is change the culture of acceptance that these plays are ordinary and routine and an accepted part of the game,\" Alderson said.  \"The costs associated in terms of health and injury just no longer warrant the status quo.\"\n\nIn a sport long bound by tradition, a ban will be a major step. MLB will also expand the use of instant replay by umpires next season in an effort to eliminate blown calls.\n\n## Rules Change Criticized\n\n\"What are they going to do next, you can't break up a double play?\" Pete Rose said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \"You're not allowed to pitch inside. The hitters wear more armor than the Humvees in Afghanistan. Now you're not allowed to be safe at home plate? What's the game coming to? Evidently, the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball.\"\n\nRose, who was banned for life in 1989 following a gambling investigation, famously bowled over catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star game. Rose insists Fosse was blocking the plate without the ball, which is against the rules.\n\n\"Since 1869, baseball has been doing pretty well,\" Rose said. \"The only rules they ever changed was the mound (height) and the DH. I thought baseball was doing pretty good. Maybe I'm wrong about the attendance figures and the number of people going to ballgames.\" DH refers to the designated hitter in an American League team's lineup who doesn't play a position in the field.\n\nAlderson said the wording of the rules change will be presented to owners for approval at their meeting in Arizona next month.\n\n\"The exact language and how exactly the rule will be enforced is subject to final determination,\" he said. \"We're going to do a fairly extensive review of the types of plays that occur at home plate to determine which we're going to find acceptable and which are going to be prohibited.\"\n\nApproval by the players' union is needed for the rules change to be effective for 2014.\n\nIf the players' union rejects the proposal, the start of the rule would be suspended for one year, but could be activated across the board after that, Alderson said.\n\nThe union declined comment while a review of the proposed change takes place.\n\n## Response To Injuries At Home Plate\n\nDiscussion to limit or ban collisions has gotten more serious since May 2011, when San Francisco Giant Buster Posey was injured by Florida Marlin Scott Cousins. Posey, an All-Star catcher, sustained a broken bone in his lower left leg and three torn ligaments in his ankle, an injury that kept him out of the game for the rest of the season.\n\nPosey returned to win the National League batting title and Most Valuable Player award in 2012, when he led the Giants to their second World Series title in three seasons.\n\n\"This is, I think, in response to a few issues that have arisen,\" Alderson said. \"One is just the general occurrence of injuries from these incidents at home plate that affect players, both runners and catchers. And also kind of the general concern about concussions that exists not only in baseball but throughout professional sports and amateur sports today. It's an emerging issue, and one that we in baseball have to address, as well as other sports.\"\n\nThe National Football League reached a settlement last summer in a concussion-related lawsuit by former players. The NFL agreed to pay the players $765 million. Last month, a group of hockey players sued the NHL.\n\nFormer catchers Joe Girardi, Bruce Bochy and Mike Matheny - all of them now managing in the majors - attended Wednesday's meeting.\n\n\"I don't think it's completely sparked by anything that's happened in baseball as much as what's happening outside of baseball and how it's impacting people and impacting the welfare of each sport,\" said Matheny, now managing the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n## \"Two Levels Of Enfocement\"\n\nBut not everyone is in favor banning the collisions.\n\n\"I lost time as a catcher being run over a couple different times, but I thought it was part of my job and I enjoyed the contact,\" said Girardi, the New York Yankees manager. \"Now I'm not so sure that everyone enjoys contact. But I love football, so I liked it.\"\n\nMLB intends to have varied levels of punishment.\n\n\"I think there will be two levels of enforcement,\" Alderson said. \"One will be with respect to whether the runner is declared safe or out based on conduct. So, for example, intentionally running over the catcher might result in an out call. So I think that the enforcement will be on the field as well as subsequent consequences in the form of fines and suspensions and the like.\"\n\nBut writing out the rules will likely be complicated.\n\n\"Does it include at every base or just home plate?\" Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter asked. \"What's considered blocking the plate, and how do you define all of it?\"\n\nThe NCAA instituted a rule on collisions for the 2011 college baseball season, saying \"contact above the waist that was initiated by the base runner shall not be judged as an attempt to reach the base or plate.\" The umpire can call the runner out and can eject the player if contact is determined to be malicious or flagrant.'"

            "title": "Olympics doping scandal threatens to tarnish Russia's golden legacy",
            "text": "\tMOSCOW, Russia - During the 2014 Sochi Olympics Russia won more medals than any other nation, as well as the largest number of gold medals. The day after the games ended, a beaming President Vladimir Putin presented his athletes with state awards. He praised them for \"defending the honor\" of their country by showing that its \"great and glorious\" sports traditions were still strong.\n\nNow Russia's achievements at Sochi may be tarnished. On Monday a report was released that claims cheating was widespread during the games. The report accuses Russian track and field athletes of using banned performance-enhancing drugs to give themselves an edge. Furthermore, it claims this doping was widespread and state-sponsored.\n\nInternational sports has long held outsized importance for Russians as a way to measure their country's standing in the world. From the 1960s to the 1980s the Soviet Union - which Russia was then part of - was a dominating force in sports, known as the \"Big Red Machine.\"\n\nThat is why accusations of cheating drew such a harsh reaction Tuesday in Moscow. It would be a huge embarrassment for Russia if its track and field athletes were kept out of next year's summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n## Officials Claim Anti-Russian Conspiracy\n\nRussian officials have attacked the report, which was prepared by a commission from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). They claim it failed to prove its main points and have suggested the existence of an anti-Russian conspiracy.\n\n\"As long as there is no evidence, it is difficult to consider the accusations,\" said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The accusations, he added, appear rather baseless.\n\nThe acting head of the Russian athletics federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said the report's conclusions appeared to have been \"made to order.\"\n\nPutin has called a meeting Wednesday with the heads of Russia's sports federations to discuss preparations for the 2016 Olympics. Zelichenok said the doping allegations may be discussed at the meeting.\n\n## Security Service Cover-up Suspected\n\nMonday's report not only claims that Russia engaged in systematic doping of track and field athletes, including several Olympic medalists. It also claims that there were state-directed cover-ups. The report says agents from the Federal Security Service interfered with the work of a lab that was supposed to test for doping at the Sochi Games.\n\nThe WADA commission recommended that track and field's governing body, the IAAF, suspend the Russian federation from competition. IAAF President Sebastian Coe gave the federation until the end of the week to respond to the doping allegations.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said it is prepared to strip medals from athletes found guilty of doping violations.\n\nRussia also has been threatened with suspension from track and field competitions, including the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Zelichenok appealed to the IAAF to show \"prudence\" and allow Russians to compete.\n\nRussian track and field head coach Yuri Borzakovsky will be among those meeting with Putin. Borzakovsky is a former Olympic 800-meter champion,\n\nIn response to Monday's report, WADA stripped Russia's anti-doping lab in Moscow of its official authority. Hours later, lab director Grigory Rodchenkov resigned.\n\n## Fall Of Soviet Union Took A Toll\n\nRussia has been a track and field power for decades but has been slipping in recent years. Its main strengths are now in race walking, women's middle-distance running and the field events, particularly the pole vault. The world record-holder, Yelena Isinbayeva, is Russian.\n\nAt the 2013 world track and field championships in Moscow, Russia took home more gold medals than the other countries. Of its 17 medals, seven were gold. This year at the Beijing World Athletics Championships, Russia won only two gold medals and four in all.\n\nUntil 1991, the Soviet Union enjoyed enormous international success, especially in sports such as hockey, figure skating and gymnastics. It had a huge pool of talent from its 15 republics and a very well-funded athletic training system.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union, however, Russia went through a period of economic chaos. As a result, its stadiums and other sports facilities deteriorated. Low salaries and the 1998 collapse of Russia's currency, the ruble, forced many athletes and coaches to compete abroad.\n\nThe post-Soviet athletic decline hit bottom at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. Russia left those games with only three gold medals and the daunting task of rebuilding its team in time for the Winter Games in Sochi four years later.\n\n## Games Were Used To Boost National Pride\n\nThe Sochi Olympics were part of a broader effort by Putin to restore national pride. The total cost was a record $51 billion. The Games yielded huge successes for Russia's athletes, who won 13 golds - their highest Winter Games haul ever - and 33 total medals.\n\nIn congratulating the medalists, Putin noted it was important for Russia to showcase not only its new, modern sports facilities in Sochi but also its athletes. He said they are worthy of carrying the banner of Russia's \"great and glorious traditions.\"\n\n\"You showed that these traditions are strong,\" the president said. \"Our country, as before, produces brilliant, strong athletes, who are able to amaze and delight our citizens, filling them with pride in their fatherland.\"\n\nPolitical analyst Andrei Kolesnikov said Putin plays up sports victories as a way to build support for his presidency. In turn, he said, Putin's emphasis on national achievement in sports may put pressure on sports officials.\n\n\"Maybe it was not the decision of Putin to use these medical means, but the very atmosphere in Russia, it leads to these solutions made by some sports officials. They are trying to be victorious, they must win everywhere,\" Kolesnikov said.\n\nKolesnikov predicted Putin would use the doping scandal to his political advantage, by standing up to what he would portray as a hostile West. At the same time, he said, Putin will probably punish someone at home to show that he is taking action.'"

            "text": "\tLONDON - Racism and extremism are growing in Russian soccer and threaten the safety of visitors to Russia for the 2018 World Cup, according to a new report.\n\nIn the report, researchers highlighted more than 200 cases of racist and xenophobic behavior - hateful acts against foreigners - linked to Russian soccer. The report covers the 2012-14 seasons in Russian soccer, called football in Europe.\n\n\"It shows a really quite gruesome picture of a domestic league, which is full of aspects of racism, xenophobia,\" said Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism (FARE) in Europe. His group helps prosecute racism cases for the governing body of European football, UEFA. The Russian research group SOVA Center also helped prepared the report.\n\n\"Russia needs to get to a point where people can be assured if they go (to the 2018 World Cup) they won't be attacked,\" Powar said.\n\n## Players Say They Will Walk\n\nThe report listed dozens of cases where fans raised money for imprisoned neo-Nazis, who promote white superiority and are typically anti-black and anti-Jewish. The report pinpointed 72 displays of neo-Nazi symbols at soccer games and 22 acts against ethnic people from the Caucasus region of Russia, which includes Dagestan and Chechnya. It included just five instances of abuse against black people. Yet, during the current soccer season, there seemed to be an increase of racist actions against black people.\n\nThe report - entitled \"Time for Action\"- expresses concern that the next World Cup will be held in Russia in three years.\n\n\"Our hope in Russia in the lead-up to 2018 is we get action taken to protect the safety of fans and of players,\" Powar said. \"Players have already said they will walk off if they hear racism. That is a danger. We want that to be addressed in advance.\"\n\nThe Russian Football Union and World Cup 2018 organizers both declined to comment.\n\n## President Pledges Progress\n\nThe report was sent on Friday to Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, the international soccer association that runs the World Cup. On Friday, a post on Blatter's Twitter account said that in December, FIFA's anti-discrimination task force presented a plan to tackle discrimination before the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIn 2010, Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to address the xenophobia, racism and religious intolerance at soccer games.\n\n\"We see it and we believe it is a problem and unfortunately we have quite a number of such problems,\" Putin said at the time.\n\n\"Russia is fighting it just like any other country in the world,\" he said. \"We will do it persistently in future.\"\n\n## Any Player Is Fair Game\n\nBut the report argues that not enough is being done by the Russian government and soccer authorities to fight racism. The report says \"it will be difficult to ensure the safety of visitors\" to the World Cup unless Russia implements a series of measures to punish discriminatory conduct consistently, create a plan to take on racist groups, prioritize educating Russians about xenophobia, and promote diversity in Russian cities hosting World Cup matches.\n\nAlthough some fans shout racist abuse for political reasons, many others use it as a tactic to distract the opposition's star players, according to Dmitry Dedkov. He is a longtime fan of the Spartak Moscow soccer team.\n\n\"A good player on the team of your main or chief opponent is an irritant, like a red rag to a bull,\" he said. \"They can insult an African or any other player.\"\n\n## Questionable Behavior\n\nThe report acknowledged that rules were put in place in 2011 to combat discrimination at games.\n\nHowever, it pointed out that the number of incidents of racism around stadiums has not decreased despite the threat of sanctions. These sanctions, or punishments, include fines and stadium closures.\n\n\"This is not surprising because the boundaries of what is accepted in the football fan scene are blurry,\" the report says. \"Well-known coaches and players have photos taken with fans wearing swastika tattoos or T-shirts with Nazi symbols.\" Popular singers also sing songs with them in the stands.\n\nThe report particularly highlights offensive conduct by fans of five Russian soccer clubs. Far-right, extremist fan groups use neo-Nazi symbols, including swastikas, and wave banners that read \"White Pride World Wide.\"\n\nThe report says that none of this is surprising. Hatred of foreigners has been growing more intense inside Russian society since the early 2000s.\n\n## Pessimistic About The Near Future\n\nThe report does single out cases where UEFA, European football's governing body, ruled against Russian clubs. In the 2013-14 season, CSKA Moscow fans made monkey noises at Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure during a game. The Russian team was fined for racism. Toure, who is from Ivory Coast in Africa, said, \"If we aren't confident at the World Cup, coming to Russia, we don't come.\"\n\nAlthough only five cases of abuse against black people were listed in the report, Powar said the actual problem is far worse. He said so far this season there has been increased abuse of black players - Africans and those from Latin America.\n\nThere also have been cases where the Russian Football Union punishes the victims.\n\nIn December, fans of the Moscow team Spartak made offensive racial comments to FC Rostov midfielder Guelor Kanga, who is from Gabon in Africa. He responded with a rude gesture and was banned for three matches. Spartak was only fined about $1,300.\n\nA Russian coach, Igor Gamula, was even banned for five matches for making discriminatory comments about black players on his own team.\n\n\"Racist attitudes\" are \"widespread among Russian football fans,\" it concluded. \"It is unlikely that this situation will fundamentally improve in the near future.\"'"

            "title": "Study: Heading ball isn't biggest culprit in high school soccer concussions",
            "text": "\tMost of the concussions that high school soccer players get are not the result of heading the ball, new research shows. Instead, most head injuries come from athlete-to-athlete contact, the kind of rough play that is against the rules.\n\nThe study, published by JAMA Pediatrics, also found that girls seem to be at higher risk of getting concussions than boys.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional wisdom that heading the ball is the most dangerous part of soccer.\n\nThough heading was still the most common single activity that led to a concussion, the majority of concussions came from other physical contact. 69 percent of boys and 51 percent of girls sustained a concussion from rough activity such as crashing into another player while defending, goaltending, chasing a loose ball, receiving a pass or dribbling down the field.\n\nOnly about a third of boys' concussions and a quarter of girls' concussions happened while heading the ball.\n\n## Limit Athlete-To-Athlete Contact To Reduce Injuries\n\n\"If you ban heading, yes, you will prevent some concussions in soccer, perhaps as much as 30 percent,\" said Dawn Comstock, an epidemiologist at Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. What's more important, according to Comstock, is simply enforcing the existing rules of the game, making sure referees keep aggressive play to a minimum and curtailing the amount of athlete-athlete contact. \"You would actually prevent many more concussions,\" she said.\n\nThe rest of the concussions came from slamming into a playing apparatus, such as a goal post (29 percent of those for girls and 17 percent of those for boys), and banging one's head on the ground (19 percent of girls and 13 percent of boys).\n\nFemale athletes were more likely to get concussions than males, researchers found. Over the course of 10,000 games or practices, girls averaged 4.5 concussions while boys averaged only 2.78.\n\n## Girls Have More Concussions Than Boys In Same Sport\n\n\"Consistently in gender-comparable sports like soccer and basketball, where girls and boys play by the same rules using the same equipment, we see higher rates of concussion in girls,\" Comstock said.\n\nAlthough no one is entirely sure why this is the case, there are some theories.\n\nThe first one is physical. It could be that girls have less neck strength than boys, so their brains get more jostled by an impact to the head, Comstock said.\n\nThe second relates to reporting. Girls may be more likely to notice the symptoms of concussions and report them to their coaches. Additionally, adult coaches and referees who spend time with student athletes may be more attentive to the health of female players than of males.\n\nThe researchers' calculations were based on data reported by high school soccer coaches from 2005 to 2014 as part of the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study. They used a random sample of 100 high schools nationwide to determine the proportion of players who got concussions during school-sanctioned soccer practices or games. This data was combined with information on what exactly the athletes were doing when they received the head injury.\n\n## Addition Of Girls Has Added To Big Growth In Numbers\n\nThe number of students playing soccer has risen dramatically in recent years. Almost 800,000 high school students of both sexes played on school soccer teams in the United States in 2014. That number was approximately 50,000, and all male, in 1969, the study noted.\n\nAs the game has become more popular, it has also become more dangerous, with concussion rates rising for both male and female players. Other studies show that soccer matches have become rougher over time, with fewer fouls and penalties called for illegal player-to-player contact.\n\nThe most effective way to cut down on concussions - for both male and female players - would be to reduce the amount of physical contact between athletes, Comstock said.\n\n## Obey The Rules, Reduce Inappropriate Contact\n\n\"We don't have to allow soccer to turn into football,\" she said. \"There will always be some athlete-athlete contact while soccer is played. But a large amount of the athlete-athlete contact that's currently happening is technically against the rules of the game.\"\n\nRoger Blake is executive director of the California Interscholastic Federation, which governs high school sports in the state. He also agrees safety must come first.\n\n\"The rules are there,\" Blake said. \"The game can be physical, but the officials have to make those calls to keep it from getting overly rough.\"\n\nIf referees are going to make errors, he added, they should \"err on the side of safety for these kids.\"\n\n## Select Coaches, Leagues That Adhere To Proper Play\n\nParents can play their part, too. They can make sure their kids are playing for a coach who does not tolerate overly aggressive behavior and in a league that hires referees who appropriately call fouls and give penalties when players are too rough, Comstock said.\n\nOverall though, playing soccer in high school is still good for kids, she said.\n\n\"The long-term negative risks of an inactive lifestyle - obesity, cardiac disease, diabetes - those are much more concerning than the very small likelihood that any individual soccer player will be seriously injured,\" she said. \"We want more kids to play sports more often. We just want to keep them as safe as possible while they do so.\"'"

            "title": "A season's hits to the head in college football can take a toll, study says",
            "text": "\tCollege athletes who get through their sport's season concussion-free may not be completely in the clear, new research suggests.\n\nFootball and ice hockey players who had no outward signs of head injury showed worrisome changes in brain structure and mental performance following the season. Those changes weren't shared by athletes who competed in sports such as track, crew and cross-country skiing. The results are in a report published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nThe findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that a season-long succession of small hits may prompt changes in the brain. Those changes cause problems with memory, mood or mental performance years down the road. The changes come even though none of the individual hits are hard enough to cause a player to seem disoriented or to draw medical attention.\n\nOr, they may heal during the off-season. Scientists are still trying to figure out how readily the brain recovers from injury. They also want to know whether there are limits beyond which damage can add up or be irreversible.\n\n## A Matter Of White Matter\n\nThe new results don't resolve the matter. But they do suggest that repetitive blows to the head are not without consequence, even when an athlete is able to get up and keep playing, said study leader Thomas McAllister. He is a psychiatrist at Indiana University. Psychiatrists help treat mental problems.\n\n\"The management and detection of [concussion](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) is obviously important,\" McAllister said. \"But may not be sufficient.\"\n\nThe study centered on 159 students at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., who played on varsity teams between 2007 and 2011. Except for football, all of the sports were played by both men and women. McAllister worked at Dartmouth until last year.\n\nThe 80 athletes who played contact sports wore accelerometers in their helmets. The devices measured the number and force of blows to the head during all practices and games. In addition, all of the study participants got MRI brain scans and took mental performance tests before and after their seasons.\n\nThe researchers looked only at athletes who were not diagnosed with a concussion during the season they were tracked. They drew important connections between blows to the head and changes in brain structure as well as the students' mental performance weeks after their sport ended.\n\nMRI measured the density and integrity of white matter in the brain. White matter are bundles of fatty tissue that speed electrical signals among neurons. The scans showed that after a single season, football and hockey players experienced changes that were greater than anything seen in the brains of the athletes who played noncontact sports. The players who had the biggest changes in white matter also had the worst performance on postseason tests of verbal learning and memory.\n\n## Brain's Bounceback\n\nMcAllister said the good news was that despite years of playing their sports, the white matter of contact-sport athletes at the start of their seasons was largely the same as that of athletes in noncontact sports. That suggests the brains of college athletes may largely bounce back from a season's wear and tear.\n\nBut it will take far more research to determine whether there are certain athletes who don't heal as well. There could also be athletes for whom small changes in the brain structure can have large, and possibly delayed, effects.\n\n\"We know some of them heal. But some of them don't,\" said Eric Nauman, a professor at Purdue University. Nauman has spent five years tracking the effects of small and large hits in high school football.\n\nMRIs aren't very good at picking up changes in white matter. That means the fact that differences were seen in the Dartmouth athletes is remarkable, Nauman said.\n\n\"If you're seeing structural changes at the level the MRI can pick up, that is very worrisome,\" said Nauman. \"We're desperately trying to figure out what the long-term implications are.\" Nauman was not involved in the study\n\nMcAllister wants to find a line between hits that are safe, and hits that cause concussions. But years of study have made him suspect that if that line exists, it may tell only part of the story.\n\nWell before they result in concussion, blows to the head change the brain's structure and the way it works, at least temporarily, he said. And there's growing evidence that a succession of those smaller hits puts players at higher risk for the one that finally leads to a concussion, McAllister said.\n\n\"You quickly see that the emphasis on 'the' hit is misplaced,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE - Suicide looms over Indian Country, claiming more lives of native youth than those in any other population. And not only in Washington state, but nationally.\n\nState Department of Health statistics released this month show that in Washington, the rate of suicide among native youth from 10 to 24 years old was more than double the rate of any other ethnic group.\n\nTribes are fighting back.\n\nAt the Lummi Nation, tribal leaders last year improved a long-standing social services program to prevent young suicides. The Colville, Spokane and Yakama tribes also are using prevention grants and training through the Native Aspirations Program. The Spokane-based program for the past five years has helped 65 tribes across the country combat suicide, the second-biggest killer of native youth, after accidents.\n\nThat might even be an undercount, experts say.\n\n\"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such,\" said Victoria Wagner, executive director of the Youth Suicide Prevention Program. The Seattle-based program has outreach workers across the state working with schools and parent groups to teach the warning signs of suicide and prevention strategies.\n\nIn Indian Country, there are many problems that increase the risks of youth suicide, Wagner said. Poverty, isolation, lack of adequate resources to treat mental health problems, substance abuse and family turmoil are some of the reasons she listed. \"There is this feeling of being trapped, and having nowhere to go.\"\n\n## Positives Over Negatives\n\nAt a recent prevention training session at the Lummi Youth Academy outside Bellingham, the emphasis was on the positive.\n\n\"How do we make life less to do with pain, and more to do with beauty?\" asked executive director Shasta Cano-Martin. Two youth coaches led the kids in writing lists of things that built their self-esteem - and root causes that could lead to risky behavior.\n\n\"No support,\" offered one teenager. \"Feeling like you don't belong,\" said another. \"Abuse,\" said another. \"Failure,\" came a tiny voice from a child who seemed too young to know the feeling, but clearly did.\n\nBut the kids were quick, too, with long lists of things that lead to feelings of self-worth and confidence: Succeeding on tests. Nailing a basket on the court. Hugs. Doing something nice for someone else. Sobriety. Having the urge to try, and succeeding beyond expectations.\n\n## Familiar Struggles\n\nKyla Frajman, 21, said suicide was no stranger to her. \"I thought about it a lot, but always fought my way through it,\" said Frajman, a member of the Cowichan First Nation in British Columbia. \"I don't do it myself,\" she said of suicide, \"because I don't want the younger kids to think it's allowed.\"\n\nBut she has a friend she knows is going through a rough patch. \"When I don't hear from him, I worry about it.\"\n\nExperts who track the problem of native youth suicide fear it will get worse. A budget fight in Washington has triggered automatic spending cuts called sequestration. The cuts have reduced funding for mental health services for [Indian people](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american), which were already scarce to begin with.\n\n## A National Emergency\n\nIndian Health Services is the major federal program that provides funding for health care services for tribes. Today it covers only about 52 percent of the needed care, and mental-health needs account for more than a third of the underfunding, said Erin Bailey, director of the Center for Native American Youth.\n\nAs in Washington, the suicide rate among native youth nationally is 2-1/2 times that of any other youth population, Bailey said. \"It is definitely a national problem, a national emergency,\" Bailey said. \"This is weighing especially hard on our hearts at this time, with native communities facing cuts for native health care.\"\n\nPatricia Whitefoot, director of Indian Education for the Toppenish School District, said suicide prevention is a top priority identified by parents of students at Toppenish High School in Yakima County. Native students embarked on a wellness walk last Friday to emphasize the positive role that culture can play in this, she said.\n\nIt's just one step in what will have to be a longer journey, she said. \"Teachers are so busy paying attention to test scores, how much time is there for addressing these major health issues in our community? And, as teachers, that has not been their training.\"\n\n## No Longer Taboo\n\nAt the Yakama Nation, Vanessa Smartlowit, administrative assistant in the tribe's behavioral-health department, said the tribe is seeking to bolster its youth with everything from motivational speakers to dealing with bullying in schools. Even simple things - talking circles, bead-working classes and cultural activities - \"just something for them to learn and keep busy,\" can help, she said.\n\nTaboo no longer, suicide is a danger that has to be talked about, Wagner said.\n\n\"You are not planting the idea,\" Wagner said. \"It is already there.\"'"

            "text": "\tRALEIGH, N.C. - At the University of North Carolina (UNC), an academic fraud scandal - which featured fake classes and fake grades - was allowed to continue for nearly two decades before it ended in 2011, a new investigation has found.\n\nThe school is now struggling to deal with fallout from the scandal.\n\nThe latest investigation found that university leaders, faculty members and staff missed or ignored red flags that could have stopped the problem years earlier. More than 3,100 students - about half of them athletes - benefited from fake classes that gave high grades in the African and Afro-American Studies department (AFAM).\n\nFormer U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein's report notes that the fake classes ended in 2011 and since then, the university has re-made the department and put new policies in place. Still, UNC must wait to find out whether the damaging new details will lead to more problems.\n\n## Scrutinizing The Report\n\nThere are two organizations watching the UNC report closely. One is a group that accredits colleges and universities: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' (SACS) Commission on Colleges examines schools to make sure they are offering a high- quality education. In other words, it accredits them.\n\nThe other group, the NCAA, is in charge of college sports. It is examining the scandal in relation to UNC's sports programs to see if athletes received special treatment and whether the school's leaders were really in control.\n\n\"Bad actions of a relatively few number of people were definitely compounded by inaction and the lack of really appropriate checks and balances,\" Chancellor Carol Folt said Thursday. \"And it was together that really allowed this to persist for such a length of time.\"\n\nThe report gave disturbing details: athletic counselors encouraged athletes to sign up for the fake classes, which from 1993 to 2011 did not require attendance. They only required a research paper that would always receive a grade of A or B regardless of quality, after being looked over by an office secretary, who also signed the chairman's name to grade lists.\n\nThose two people - former Chairman Julius Nyang'oro and retired administrator Deborah Crowder - were at the center of the scheme. Wainstein's report, though, also noted that other school officials who had suspicions or specific concerns failed to act on them. All this added up to missed chances to stop the fraud, which allowed it to escalate.\n\n## \"It's A Mess\"\n\nThe university is now facing questions about its accreditation - whether it is an honest institution that is providing high-quality education to its students.\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' Commission on Colleges had UNC on its watch list until this summer. It also required the school to allow students who took a fake class to take another for free.\n\nIn the next few days, the commission will send UNC a letter asking school leaders to show that they are complying with standards needed for the seal of approval, commission President Belle Wheelan said.\n\n\"What we would do is ask them: is this bigger than you thought it was, what are you going to do now? It's a mess,\" Wheelan said.\n\nThe school's 77-member board will address the issue in its December meeting, she said.\n\n\"We are interested in more than anything in making sure that the students don't run into problems trying to explain any degrees that they have after the fact as a result of this,\" Wheelan said.\n\n## Someone Must Be In Control\n\nOne of the agency's core requirements for accreditation is that the university have clear control over \"all aspects of its educational program,\" including athletics.\n\nWith the NCAA investigation, the issue of control is important as well. What coaches knew is a key issue that could lead to sports wins and championships being taken away, or vacated.\n\n\"If we go back with the NCAA in our joint review, and ... if we've identified that we have played students who were ineligible, then obviously we would have to vacate wins at that time,\" UNC Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham said. \"But as long as the courses and the credits and everything count to the accrediting agency, we're very comfortable with our certification process - that our students were eligible to compete when they competed.\"\n\n## Holding Everyone Accountable\n\nAfter years of a hands-off approach by school leaders, the university's fate now lies in the hands of these two groups.\n\nBoth the AFAM department and its chairman didn't face outside reviews. Most academic departments are reviewed every five years, but AFAM was not because it did not have a graduate program giving out Master of Arts degrees or doctorates.\n\nAFAM's chairman, Nyang'oro, wasn't reviewed by colleagues because he was a department chairman.\n\nFolt, UNC's current leader, said the school would have caught the fraud sooner if it had not been for those two exemptions, which have since been removed.\n\nThere were other chances to stop the fraud, and Folt is holding everyone accountable.\n\n\"It really isn't something that you could look at as only one thing,\" the chancellor said. \"It had the combination, and that's why we have to make sure we can't be complacent about it. We have to accept full responsibility for it.\"'"

            "text": "\tBALTIMORE, Md. - Under Armour wants customers to connect star athletes' personal stories to the shirts on their backs and the shoes on their feet.\n\n\"No Art for Art's Sake\" is the slogan that the Baltimore, Maryland, sporting goods company came up with to market its stylish fitness apparel and athletic shoes. The slogan is intended to give meaning to its products, which feature designs and colors that symbolize the stories of celebrity athletes endorsed by the sportswear company. Under Armour hopes an emotional connection to the athletes will inspire customers to buy more gear.\n\n\"We always strive to tell a story,\" said Adam Clement, the company's senior creative director for team sports.\n\n## Their Favorite Things\n\nBasketball player Stephen Curry loves sour candy. Baseball's Bryce Harper drives a black Camaro, and football star Cam Newton played ball for a college with a famous sports rivalry. Under Armour has designed shoes and uniforms to reflect all three famous athletes and some of their favorite things. \n\nCurry is the Most Valuable Player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and two different shoes designed for him make a reference to Bible verses. He is deeply religious. Another shoe displays a color pattern related to his father. Yet another shoe is bright yellow, green and red. It is called \"Candy Reign\" because the bright colors match the Sour Patch Kids candy that Curry loves so much.\n\nThe basketball star's popularity has been good for Under Armour, which markets him as an underdog. Curry was bypassed by many college basketball recruiters because he is not big for his position.\n\nCurry recently extended his sponsorship deal with Under Armour through 2024. He said he looks forward to being part of the brand's story \"for the rest of my playing career and beyond.\"\n\nHarper plays Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals. Next season, Under Armour says the star will debut a black baseball shoe signifying Harper's devotion to his custom-built black Chevrolet Camaro. Harper is from Nevada, and the gold shoes he wore during the 2013 Home Run Derby, an MLB hitting contest, represented the glittering Las Vegas, Nevada, skyline.\n\n\"We did a quick flash sale and it sold out within minutes,\" said Josh Rattet, Under Armour's vice president for footwear.\n\nNewton is a quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, a National Football League (NFL) team. He wears football cleats in practice that highlight some of his favorite causes such as breast cancer and military service. Newton also played college ball for Auburn University in Alabama. He wore a shoe in November to support his alma mater in the Iron Bowl, a rivalry game against the University of Alabama. \n\nUnder Armour said it has also designed cleats for Newton in traditional Christmas colors for the holiday season, and colors that represent the state of Georgia, where he grew up. However, in his NFL games, Newton must wear shoes only in the colors tied to his NFL team.\n\n## An Underdog Bites Back\n\nUnder Armour often markets itself as an underdog like Curry. Big competitor Nike, Inc., out of Oregon, sells far more apparel and footwear, but Under Armour is growing rapidly. Under Armour has a goal of reaching $7.5 billion in annual sales by 2018. Footwear and international sales as well as sales to women and online fitness applications are all driving Under Armour's growth, adding up to $3 billion in sales last year.\n\nNike also links its products and sportswear to athletes' stories.\n\nAnalysts say the two companies are competing to sell apparel and shoes, sign elite athletes for endorsement deals and uncover sports stars' inspiring narratives.\n\n## Mixed Reviews\n\nGeorge Kiel runs a sneaker blog called NiceKicks.com. He said that with Curry and others, Under Armour goes deeper into a star athlete's personal story than other brands.\n\n\"Now athletes express themselves through their footwear,\" Kiel said. \"It's kind of a competition to see who brings the best footwear out.\" \n\nNike did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder Armour's designs do not always get favorable reviews. Earlier this year, one sports news website said, \"Under Armour is trying way too hard to be cool,\" and went on to say that the company has ugly shoes and dumb slogans.\n\nUnder Armour designed new uniforms based on the colors of the Maryland state flag for the Maryland Terrapins. When the college football team showed off their new uniforms in 2011, NBA superstar LeBron James tweeted, \"Ewwwww.\" \n\nShortly afterward, Clement hired workers for a project at his home, and said one asked if he worked for Under Armour, then commented that the guy who designed the Maryland uniforms must be on drugs. Clement said he responded: \"Well, you're looking at him, and I'm not.\"\n\nThe key, Under Armour officials say, is to unearth themes that will create an emotional connection for athletes, teams and their fans.\n\n## The Cheetah And The Snake\n\nIn 2013, Under Armour developed attire for Natasha Hastings, an American track star.\n\n\"The cheetah is her favorite animal since it's the fastest animal,\" Clement said. \"We placed the cheetah on the back so all those behind her would know the race leader couldn't be caught, that the cheetah was out in front of them.\"\n\nUnder Armour went with a different animal for the U.S. Naval Academy men's basketball team. The custom uniforms have a logo that says, \"Don't Tread on Me,\" inspired by the United States Navy flag, with a snake above red and white stripes, meant to symbolize the American fight for freedom.\n\n\"If you design something just because it's on trend or different or cool, or because black is what everyone's wearing, it's not going to stand the test of time,\" Clement said.\n\nIdeas, however, endure, he said.'"

            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia - Cross-country skier Mathilde Amivi Petitjean was recruited for Togo's first Winter Olympics team via Facebook.\n\nPetitjean, 19, whose mother is from Togo, grew up in the French Alps and skied for France. Alpine skier Alessia Afi Dipol, 18, is another member of Team Togo. An Italian national who used to ski for India, his feet have barely touched the soil of the sweltering West African nation.\n\nBut to Togo Olympic Committee Vice President Kelani Bayor, these athletes bleed Togolese yellow, red and green.\n\n\"These are true blue Togolese,\" Kelani insisted in French. \"They don't live in Togo but they are part of the diaspora.\"\n\n## Newbies To Winter Games\n\nTogo's of-the-country-but-not-necessarily-from-it Olympic team is one of seven countries without winter sports that are participating in the Winter Games for the first time.\n\nTeams from Dominica, East Timor, Malta, Paraguay, Tonga and Zimbabwe also marched in the parade of nations at Sochi's opening ceremony.\n\n\"If I was told I would one day compete at the Olympic Games, I would never have believed it would be in the colors of Togo,\" Petitjean said.\n\nBecause of a lack of mountains, snow, facilities or knowledge of winter sports, some of these Olympic newbies have pushed the limits to field teams.\n\nThe Dominica cross-country ski team, for example, come from Staten Island, N.Y., not the Caribbean island they represent in Sochi. Gary and Angelica di Silvestri, a husband and wife in their 40s,  volunteered in the tiny Caribbean nation and were granted citizenship in return.\n\n## Born There, Didn't Stay There\n\nSome of the new Olympians were born in the country they represent, but they didn't stay there long. Paraguayan slopestyle skier Julia Marino was born in Paraguay, but was adopted by an American family and moved to the United States when she was less than a year old.\n\nMarino, a Boulder, Colo., resident who skied for the United States until last year, has visited Paraguay just once.\n\n\"I'm going to spend a bit more time down there,\" she said Tuesday. \"They have a great national Olympic Committee and I can learn more about my country.\"\n\nZimbabwe alpine skier Luke Henri Steyn was born in Harare. But his family moved to Switzerland, where he started skiing at age 2. He was studying at the University of Colorado in Boulder before taking a year off to focus on the Sochi Games.\n\nThe Winter Olympic rookie nations aren't the only ones with nation-hopping athletes. Prized South Korean speed skater Ahn Hyun-soo is competing for Russia under the name Viktor Ahn. He ditched his motherland for not sending him to the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.\n\nForeign Policy magazine's website recently called these Olympians \"carpetbaggers\" who have only tenuous ties to their motherlands. The magazine said they are reminders that \"even as the Games embrace the (speech) of national pride, opportunism knows no borders.\"\n\n## Explaining Slalom In Togo\n\nOlympic citizenship rules are flexible. And some countries are so hungry for Olympic attention and glory, that changing their passport is becoming the new normal among athletes.\n\n\"And countries will facilitate the growth of this pattern, too, in order to have representatives on the team so as to make their presence felt on the world stage,\" said Janice Forsythe. She directs the International Centre for Olympic Studies at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. \"In Canada, we move elite athletes to the front of the immigration line, speeding up their immigration papers in time for the Olympics.\"\n\nTogo discovered Petitjean online instead of in the immigration line. The nation's new sliding sports committee contacted her after she posted a positive comment on Facebook about Gervacio Madja, a Togolese-born, Munich-raised men's cross-country skier.\n\n\"We first got in touch with her in May 2013,\" Hyacinthe Edorh, head of Togolese team at the Sochi Games, said of Petitjean. \"With Mathilde we are certain she will surprise everyone because she is only 19 years old and she is capable of competing for the next 10 to 15 years.\"\n\nTogo's presence at the Winter Games is part of an ambitious plan to make the country a warm-weather winter sport powerhouse. Togo's temperature ranges from 72 to 95 degrees.\n\n\"We would like to be present in all competitions in the Winter Games and want to carry out our project all over Africa,\" Hyacinthe said.\n\nBut for now, Team Togo has enough work to do in its own country.\n\n\"Some people in Togo don't know what slalom is,\" Kelani said, referring to the flags set up in a zig-zag pattern that she will have to ski around. \"I will explain to them.\"'"

            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia - It has been 17 years since the ice skaters first paired together.\n\nSeventeen years since an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old were thrown together as an ice dance team, a pairing that irritated the younger member, Charlie White. He already had been doing it for six months and Meryl Davis was just starting. With her as a partner, he was back to dance Square One while she caught up - quickly.\n\nSeventeen years during which Davis said there never was any doubt about whether they should stick it out.\n\nSeventeen years leading to a free dance so physically and mentally demanding it left them looking as if they had spent 17 years of energy on the four minutes of skating. They were unable to do anything but collapse into each other's arms when it was over Monday night at the Iceberg Skating Palace.\n\n## A First For U.S.\n\nAnd seventeen years for a moment, the moment when the scores were announced and two kids from Michigan realized all that work and time with each other had made them the first U.S. skating couple to win an Olympic gold medal, either in dance or pairs.\n\n\"You dream of the opportunity, and being able to put in the work every day to make it happen is a tribute to our partnership,\" White said.\n\n\"We prepared ourselves so well for what we wanted to put onto the ice and focused so hard on that, we weren't really prepared for what might happen,\" Davis said.\n\nSuch relentless effort was needed for Davis and White to beat the 2010 Olympic champions, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada. The Canadian and American pairs had become not only fierce rivals but friends during the decade they have trained together under the same coaches in Canton, Mich.\n\n\"The struggles, the rivalry, knowing if you're not perfect then you can forget about your dreams, with that constant striving for perfection, you have to look in the mirror and figure out every day what it is going to take to get there,\" White said. \"You mature a lot quicker under that kind of pressure.\"\n\n## Skating To \"Scheherazade\"\n\nVirtue and Moir had been the first North American ice dancers to win Olympic gold. Both couples had become so good they would lose only to the other in the four years beginning with the Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. In those 2010 games, Davis and White were the silver medalists.\n\n\"We're linked forever,\" White said.\n\nBut he and Davis have separated themselves from the Canadians in the judges' eyes. The two Americans skated to music from \"Scheherazade.\" The ballet is based on the tale of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights where a woman named Scheherazade must tell 1,001 stories to the sultan to avoid being killed. The U.S. couple continued a dominance over Moir and Virtue that has reached six competitions in a time span fast approaching the 1,001 nights in the story.\n\nDavis and White won both the short and free dances with season bests. Their total score of 195.52 beat Virtue and Moir by 4.53 points.\n\n\"No athlete likes to sit in this position,\" Moir said, referring to second place, \"but it is easier when you know how hard these guys worked.\"\n\nVirtue and Moir have said this will be their last season as competitors, while Davis and White have made no decision. Both U.S. skaters have been intermittent students at the University of Michigan.\n\n## A Bolshoi-Like \"Swan Lake\"\n\nThe next great dance team clearly is going to be Russians Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katasalapov. They took third place with the most compelling free dance of the night. Their interpretation of \"Swan Lake,\" full of poses and movements that turned the arena into Moscow's famous Bolshoi Theater, was utterly ballet-like and seamless.\n\nThe intensity of the \"Scheherazade\" sections coach Marina Zoueva chose for Davis and White suited perfectly the power and athleticism that have come to define their skating. The most striking feature of the way they performed it was a feeling for tempo, their skating changes of pace matching the shifts in the music's speed. That is an understanding White said they had not developed until three years ago.\n\nVirtue and Moir's free dance music was an unfortunate mash-up of Russian classical pieces cut and pasted in a confusing way. Even though they skated exceptionally well Monday, and they were supposed to be interpreting the turbulence of life, a sense of fragmentation prevailed.\n\nDavis and White skated last. Two Russian couples had gone immediately before them, sending the crowd into its usual fervor of nationalistic pride.\n\n\"The moments before we take the ice are difficult,\" White said. \"It is probably the most nervous you will be in a lifetime.\"\n\nOr at least in 17 years.'"

            "text": "\tSAO PAULO - Brazil last played host to the World Cup in 1950. Brazilians have waited 64 years for the World Cup to return, and now it's finally back in their home country.\n\n\"Tudo bem\" - all good - as the Brazilians like to say.\n\nWell, just about.\n\nWith a nationwide eruption of excitement but also wafts of tear gas, the country that sees itself as the artful soul of football, which is called soccer in the U.S., kicked off one of the most troubled World Cups ever. The poor country is deeply conflicted about spending billions of dollars on hosting its showcase tournament.\n\nYet, it roared to life Thursday with a joyous 3-1 win for the home team in a stadium barely readied on time for the first of 64 matches in 12 cities. The next month will consume planet _futebol_ and showcase Brazil's growing economic might, warts and all.\n\n## A Sea Of Yellow Jerseys\n\nA few hundred protesters gathered in scattered demonstrations in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, but they were controlled by police. It wasn't close to the chaos that accompanied last year's Confederations Cup tournament, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets.\n\nAfter a funky opening ceremony featuring J-Lo in low-cut sparkling green and dancers dressed as trees, Brazil's beloved national team, the star-studded Selecao, took to the field. The Brazilians made a solid if not brilliant start to the serious business of conquering a sixth world title. A good showing could pacify much - but not all - the public anger about World Cup spending of $11.5 billion in a nation with tens of millions of poor.\n\nBrazil's first opponent was a tough but ultimately outclassed Croatian side. The all-new Itaquerao stadium, which suffered continual delays and worker deaths in its construction, was a sea of yellow jerseys. Brazilian fans crossed fingers and toes that this crop of stars will deliver victory. Even more than that, they expect football as art, the \"Jogo bonito\" - the beautiful game - that was the hallmark of the great Brazilian teams.\n\nThe game had everything aficionados love - passion, drama, spectacle and goals. Brazilian fans call themselves \"torcidas\" - derived from the Portuguese word \"to twist\" and evoking how football puts them through the wringer. This match, watched by millions around the world, certainly did that.\n\n\"I'm very emotional, happy, and happy that it's over,\" said spectator Ricieri Garbelini, visibly drained. \"I was nervous for five minutes at the beginning, and at the end.\"\n\n## An Ear-Splitting Roar\n\nBrazil made a nightmare start. Marcelo looked stunned, the crowd of 62,103 wailed and grown men watching in bars let out howls of despairing laughter when the Brazilian defender scored an own-goal that gave Croatia an unlikely 1-0 lead after just 11 minutes. And despite all the promises from government officials that Brazil would be ready, there were problems at the stadium: The lighting failed in one corner, flickering off, on, off and finally back on again after the late-afternoon kickoff.\n\nThe mood lifted when Neymar lived up to his hype as the team's biggest star and tied the game for Brazil in the 29th minute. An ear-splitting roar was unleashed from the crowd and across the nation. In the rundown city of Indaiatuba, a two-hour drive from Sao Paulo, tattooed men in undershirts celebrated by pounding on restaurant tables.\n\nDemonstrating the love-hate relationship Brazilians have developed with this World Cup, the crowd made hairs stand on end with its rousing rendition of the national anthem, but then started chanting against Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. There were also boos for FIFA, the governing body of football.\n\nThe crowd booed Rousseff again when the stadium's jumbo screens showed her celebrating Neymar's second goal - scored from the penalty spot in the 71st minute. He thrust his arms in the air and the nation did likewise. Oscar got the third in the 90th minute.\n\n## Tear Gas Against Protesters\n\nEven the football-loving Pope Francis got a touch of World Cup fever. He sent a video message on Brazilian television before the match, saying that the world's most popular sport can promote peace and solidarity by teaching the importance of working hard to reach goals and respect for opponents.\n\nBut the party wasn't all fun-loving. In Sao Paulo, police fired canisters of tear gas and stun grenades to push back more than 300 demonstrators who gathered along a main highway leading to the stadium.\n\n\"I'm totally against the Cup,\" said protester and university student Tameres Mota. \"We're in a country where the money doesn't go to the community, and meanwhile we see all these millions spent on stadiums.\"\n\nPolice also used tear gas against about 300 protesters who gathered in central Rio de Janeiro. Protesters also gathered along Rio's famous Copacabana beach.\n\nIn Belo Horizonte, another of the 12 World Cup cities, streets downtown emptied because of the game and because of protests that tore through the area just before kickoff. Riot police stood guard on street corners littered with broken glass from windows smashed in by demonstrators. One of their signs read: \"The World Cup is being done with workers' blood.\"'"

            "text": "\tLawrence Peter \"Yogi\" Berra, the Baseball Hall of Fame catcher, died Tuesday of natural causes at the age of 90.\n\nHe was known by many for such malaprops as \"90 percent of the game is half-mental.\" Or, in referring to a once-popular restaurant, he said, \"Nobody goes there any more. It's too crowded.\"\n\nBut some of the \"Yogi-isms\" continue to ring true, like \"It ain't over till it's over.\"\n\n## A Championship Ring For Every Finger\n\nWhat should not be overshadowed, though, is that Berra had a World Series ring for every finger. He played in 14 World Series, including a record 10 world championship teams with the New York Yankees. He was a team manager in two other World Series, one each with the Yankees and the New York Mets.\n\nBerra, who had 358 regular-season home runs, hit 12 homers in 14 World Series. But the most famous image of him was in a World Series when he jumped into the arms of pitcher Don Larsen after Larsen had pitched the only World Series perfect game in 1956, with Berra catching.\n\nAs a player, coach and manager, Berra was in 21 World Series. He played in 15 consecutive All-Star Games. A three-time American League Most Valuable Player, Berra's playing career spanned 1946 to 1965, and he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\n## The Nickname Stuck\n\nYogi grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, in what was then and continues to be a primarily Italian neighborhood. His parents were Italian immigrants Pietro and Paolina Berra, with his father arriving at Ellis Island, the famous New York immigration port, in 1909. He knew nothing about baseball, but would later find out, of course.\n\nAcross the street from the Berras lived Joe Garagiola, another future major league catcher. Garagiola played in his first World Series at age 20 for the 1946 World Series champion Cardinals. Both Berra and Garagiola had attended South Side Catholic school, although Berra quit school after the eighth grade.\n\nAs Berra starred in American Legion baseball in St. Louis, he received his nickname from friend Bobby Hofman, another future big leaguer. Hofman said Berra resembled a Hindu yogi, a holy man, whenever he sat with arms and legs crossed waiting to bat or while looking sad after a defeat.\n\nIn 1942, the Cardinals chose to sign Garagiola over Berra. Cardinals General Manager Branch Rickey, knowing he would soon leave St. Louis to take over the Brooklyn Dodgers, held off, wanting to sign Berra for the Dodgers. The Yankees, however, signed Berra for the same $500 bonus the Cardinals offered Garagiola. The Yankees sent Berra to Norfolk of the Class B Piedmont League in the minors and Berra was credited with driving in 23 runs during one doubleheader game.\n\n## The Catcher Also Plays The Field\n\nDuring World War II, Berra joined the U.S. Navy and served as a gunner's mate on the USS Bayfield during the D-Day invasion of Europe.\n\nBerra began playing for the Yankees in 1947 and soon established himself as one of the best \"bad-ball hitters\" in the game. When asked about that style, Berra reportedly said, \"If I can hit it, it's a good pitch.\"\n\nAs a catcher, Berra was quick, mobile and a respected handler of pitchers, but he was versatile enough to play left field in his later years.\n\nAfter managing the Yankees to the 1964 American League pennant win, Berra was fired when the Yankees lost that year's World Series to the Cardinals. Berra made a brief return to the field as a player-coach for the Mets the next year, taking his last turn at bat on May 9, 1965, when he was three days shy of his 40th birthday.\n\nHe would coach with the Mets for eight seasons before becoming their manager in 1972. That was the same year Berra not only was elected to the Hall of Fame but had his number 8 retired.\n\nIn 1973, the Mets were in last place midway through the season but when a reporter asked Berra if the season was over, he replied, \"It ain't over till it's over.\"\n\n## \"Yogi-isms\" Endure\n\nBerra certainly had a way with words. Among his other Yogi-isms was: \"If you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" Another time, he said, \"We made too many wrong mistakes.\"\n\nBerra was fired in 1975, only to return to the Yankees as a coach in 1976. The team immediately won three straight pennants and the 1977-78 World Series, reinforcing Berra's reputation as a lucky charm.\n\nLongtime Yankees manager Casey Stengel once said of Berra: \"He'd fall in a sewer and come up with a gold watch.\"\n\nBerra was named Yankees manager again in 1984 but was fired early in the 1985 season. He ended his career as a coach with the Houston Astros.\n\n## Signed Simply, Yogi Berra\n\nBerra's son, Dale, played in the majors and son, Tim, played with the Baltimore Colts in the National Football League. He was married for 65 years to wife Carmen, who was also from St. Louis. She died in 2014.\n\nThey met when Carmen, a waitress, served Yogi lunch and he asked her name and whether she was married. Their first date was at a hockey game in St. Louis. Not long after, Berra proposed marriage by placing a ring on the table in front of Carmen while they dined at the Berra family home.\n\nIn an interview some years, Carmen Berra recalled how her husband once sent her an anniversary card signed, \"Yogi Berra.\"\n\nCarmen Berra told the Daily News she was happy he signed it that way because it eliminated any confusion about all the other Yogis that she knew.\n\nBerra, who died at his home in Montclair, New Jersey, once was asked by Carmen where he wanted to be buried - in St. Louis, New York or Montclair.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. And then, as only he could say, \"Why don't you surprise me?\"'"

If a man gets a serious injury, it's still not fatal, but for women it could end much more seriously.\n\n\"If I had a daughter, I'd never let her jump - it's too much hard labor. Women have another purpose - to have children, to do housework, to create hearth and home,\"\n\nAfter fighting an uphill battle for the past decade, and filing a lawsuit four years ago, the easy part for these women was zooming downhill and flying through the air at 60 mph, about 10-15 feet off the ground, for the length of a football field.\n\nCarina Vogt of Germany won the gold medal with 247.4 points - scoring is based on a formula combining distance, speed and jump style points. Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria won the silver with 246.2 points, and Coline Mattel of France (245.2) took bronze. Iraschko-Stolz made a double statement as a female ski jumper and an openly gay woman winning a medal in a country that has been under fire for its anti-gay propaganda law.\n\n\"I think I did my best at the ski jumping, and I'm married to a woman,'' she said after the event. \"It's a good statement, especially in Russia, to show that people can live together.\"\n\nPre-Olympic favorite Sara Takanashi, a 5-foot jumper who had won 10 of 13 World Cup events this season, finished off the podium in fourth place. Jessica Jerome, 27, of Park City, Utah, was the top American in 10th place. Lindsey Van, 29, who led the charge to get the sport recognized, finished 15th.\n\n\"We can call ourselves Olympians now, and I couldn't do that yesterday,'' said Van, who admitted she bawled at the opening ceremony.\n\n\"This is something I've been doing for 20 years, hoping that one day I can go to the Olympics and jump, so being able to finally do that, that was the easiest part.'' said Jerome. \"I didn't perform to my best ability, but I'm still happy, strangely, and I think all the girls from all the countries are just smiling. There is a special camaraderie all the girls have and I really felt it (Tuesday night). We were up there high-fiving with the Norwegians and the Finns and the Canadians. Everybody was just really glad to be sharing this with someone who really gets what we've been trying to do.''\n\nThe very first competitor to jump was 19-year-old American and reigning world champion Sarah Hendrickson. She blew out her knee last August, and just returned to jumping on Jan. 11. She had only 25 training jumps the past six months, while the other jumpers had 300-400.\n\n\"I didn't realize the significance when I was given bib No. 1, obviously because I don't have any World Cup points and I was like, 'Oh, bib No. 1? That kind of sucks because I'm used to being among the last ones and then someone says, 'Well, no, you're the first girl EVER to jump in an Olympics. I kind of took that and ran with it. It's a pretty cool thing. We put on an awesome show and the world saw what we've been working for.''\n\nWatching it all from the stands, waving American flags, were the U.S. jumpers' families and others who fought for the sport.\n\n\"We've already won,'' DeeDee Corrandini, President of Women's Ski Jumping USA, said just before the start of the competition. \"Every single ski jumper who's here has already won just to be here.\n\n\"Our battle to get the women into ski jumping became much more than ski jumping It really became a women's rights issue and a human rights issue because we were really fighting for all women in all sports and in all aspects of life. Hopefully, we have taught other young girls and young women around the world that if you really are persistent, never give up, and fight hard, hopefully you can achieve your dreams.''\n\nJerome's dad, who had witnessed sexual discrimination at the U.S. Naval Academy, went to bat for his daughter. He bought the book \"Non-Profits for Dummies,'' and started raising funds for the team. Other parents were also very involved.\n\n\"I think there's a preconceived notion that men are braver than women,'' said Bill Hendrickson, Sarah's father. \"It takes a lot of guts and confidence for these women to go off this big ski jump. They are dispelling that myth that just men are brave enough to go off these big jumps. There certainly are ladies out there that have aptitude, athleticism, bravery and courage to do the same kinds of things men do.''\n\nAnd that, they say, is all they want. A chance.\n\nAn Olympic VISA commercial was recently launched featuring Hendrickson and a recording made in 1937 of Amelia Earhart saying, \"Please know I'm quite aware of the hazards. I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failures must be but a challenge to others.\"\n\nEarhart surely would be enjoyed being at the RusSki Gorki Ski Jumping Center Tuesday night.'"
