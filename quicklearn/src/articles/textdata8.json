            "title": "CVS to stop selling cigarettes this year",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - CVS Caremark will become the first national pharmacy company to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products.\n\nCVS, the nation's second-largest drugstore chain, announced Wednesday that it would cease tobacco sales at its more than 7,600 retail stores by Oct. 1.\n\nThe landmark decision comes after heavy pressure from public health advocates and medical providers. For years, they have urged retailers to make tobacco products and advertising less available, particularly to children and teenagers.\n\nIt also marks a major turn for one of the country's biggest health care companies. The decision is expected to cost CVS about $2 billion in annual sales, or about 1.6 percent of the company's 2012 revenues.\n\n## CVS Makes A Pledge\n\nCVS is second only to Walgreen Co. in the number of pharmacy locations. It has been steadily increasing its number of urgent care clinics and its business of providing health care through its pharmacists.\n\n\"As the delivery of health care evolves with an emphasis on better health outcomes, reducing chronic disease and controlling costs, CVS Caremark is playing an expanded role in providing care,\" said Larry J. Merlo. He serves as CVS's president and chief executive officer. \"Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose.\"\n\nCVS also pledged to launch what it called a \"robust national smoking cessation program\" this spring. The company is based in Woonsocket, R.I.\n\nNationwide, pharmacies were responsible for less than 5 percent of the total number of cigarettes sold in 2009, according to a study by the Center for Global Tobacco Control. But sales at pharmacies have been increasing, even as overall cigarette sales have declined.\n\nPublic health advocates praised the CVS decision. They expressed optimism that it could start new efforts to curb tobacco use.\n\n\"This is a bold step,\" said Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey. She is president and chief executive officer of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \"CVS is clearly establishing a leadership position in making the country healthier and in building a culture of health.\"\n\nHalf a century ago, the U.S. Surgeon General's report issued its groundbreaking warning about the dangers of smoking. Since then, the nation has dramatically cut smoking rates for adults from 42 percent in 1965 to just 19 percent in 2011, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n## \"A Hard Habit To Break\"\n\nBut public health advocates have grown concerned that progress has stopped in recent years.\n\nIn 1996, Target announced that it would stop selling tobacco products. Since then, no major retailer has taken steps to limit tobacco sales.\n\nAnd despite pressure on pharmacies, Walgreen went to court to try to stop San Francisco from banning tobacco sales in pharmacies. The challenge was dismissed by a federal court. Boston has a similar ban against tobacco sales in pharmacies.\n\nPublic health advocates hope that reducing the number of stores that sell tobacco products will reduce smoking rates.\n\n\"We need another boost,\" said Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer at the American Cancer Society.\n\nWender acknowledges that smokers can always go somewhere else to buy cigarettes. But making purchases a little more difficult can help tobacco users resist the urge to buy, he said.\n\n\"It is a hard habit to break,\" said Robin Koval, president and chief executive officer of Legacy, a leading advocate for the prevention of tobacco use. \"But if you are standing there in a store ... and the ad and the display is there in front of you, you may not be able to resist the urge.\"\n\n## Will Other Pharmacies Follow?\n\nCVS executives said they hoped the decision would help make tobacco use socially unacceptable.\n\n\"Making cigarettes available in pharmacies ... 'renormalizes' the product by sending the subtle message that it cannot be all that unhealthy if it is available for purchase where medicines are sold,\" according to the company's chief medical officer, Dr. Troyen Brennan. He co-authored a new article in the Journal of the American Medical Association with Dr. Steven Schroeder. He's the director of the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center at University of California--San Francisco.\n\nIn June, Starbucks began prohibiting smokers from smoking within a 25 feet of its shops. The Seattle-based coffee giant attributed the rule to \"a sense of responsibility to provide customers with a safe and healthy environment.\" Starbucks had previously banned smoking inside its cafes.\n\nIt is unclear if other pharmacy chains will follow CVS's lead.\n\nWhen Target stopped selling tobacco products nearly two decades ago, the company cited low profit margins. This was in part because the high costs of theft and age restrictions on sales. It is illegal for people under 18 to buy tobacco in the U.S. Some states have higher age limits.\n\nCVS said that the anticipated $2-billion annual sales loss would not change its profit prediction for the year.\n\nThe company said it has identified ways to offset the expected impact on its profits, but did not specify what they are. CVS reported total revenues of $123 billion in 2012.'"

            "title": "Detroit shuts off water for thousands; groups ask judge to turn it back on",
            "text": "\tDETROIT - Tracy Peasant began crying on the witness stand in federal court Monday morning. She described buying bottled water for herself and eight children, four of them her grandchildren, after her water service was cut off.\n\n\"It was hard,\" Peasant said, dabbing her eyes with a tissue.\n\nPeasant was the first witness in Monday's hearing before bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes about Detroit's water shut-off policy. In 2013, Detroit filed for bankruptcy because the city owed more than $18 billion. The bankruptcy will allow Detroit to sell off some of its property to pay its bills as well as reach deals so some of its debt is forgiven.\n\nPeasant's water was cut off at the home she rented in September 2013 because she did not pay her water bill which came to $8,500. She said it was so high because of a water leak and she was turned down for a special program that would help her pay the bill because the total was too high. Peasant said she makes $259 a month.\n\n## \"Not Looking For Free Water\"\n\nThe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) never told her she could request a hearing to challenge the bill, Peasant testified.\n\n\"No, I'm not looking for free water,\" Peasant said. \"I'm just looking for affordability, to afford it.\"\n\nThe city has cut water service to 19,000 homes in Detroit in recent months. A group of advocacy nonprofits requested that the judge issue what is called a restraining order to stop the city from shutting off people's water.\n\nThe advocacy groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, Moratorium Now and the Peoples Water Board. They argue that the city shut off water unfairly and without enough notice to homeowners. They also say the city gives little financial help to poor people who do not have enough money to pay their bills.\n\nHowever, lawyers for the city said Detroit cannot provide free water.\n\n## Fairness For All Residents\n\nAttorney Sonal Mithani said suspending shut-offs would only hurt customers who owe money, because their bills would pile up.\n\n\"The city has a responsibility to all of its residents,\" Mithani said in her opening statement. \"It's not fair to them to shoulder the burden of free water to others.\"\n\nPeasant said her water was unexpectedly restored in June by a woman she believed to be a DWSD worker. The worker was there to ensure Peasant's water had not been illegally restored, but she had a change of heart when she got to the neighborhood.\n\n\"She said, 'I can't do this with these kids and stuff. This is wrong,'\" Peasant testified. \"When she left, she said, 'You have some water now.'\"\n\nThe advocacy groups called water director Sue McCormick to testify about the shut-off policy.\n\nMcCormick acknowledged that the department's old rules for cutting off service are posted on the department's website. The old rules, written in 2003, call for a Water Department worker to identify himself or herself to the customer and show the past due account. However, this year the department hired a company to cut off the service, which often made no contact with customers before shutting off their water.\n\n## Following The Rules\n\nThe judge focused on this difference between the rule and what actually happened. He asked McCormick if it was legal to cut off service without complying with rules on the website.\n\n\"When a public body has a rule that it decides needs review and change, is it appropriate to simply ignore it and stop implementing it?\" the judge asked.\n\nMcCormick said the department stopped notifying customers face-to-face, but she was unsure exactly when the policy changed.\n\nShe said that the department has been able to change how it operates so long \"that I do believe (they are) legal terminations.\"\n\nMcCormick said the department shut off service to about 24,000 Detroit residential accounts in 2013. Another 19,500 people had service shut off before a temporary halt that ended in August. She could not answer a series of questions, though, about how many of those homes had children living there or people with medical problems or disabilities.\n\nMcCormick said the customer service department and the water system's deputy director could better answer those questions. She testified she makes $190,000 a year.'"

            "title": "The Disney dilemma: How high can prices go and still keep visitors happy?",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - \"The Happiest Place on Earth\" has become one of the most crowded places, too.\n\nTourists and locals who have annual passes are flooding Disneyland and California Adventure in large numbers. The throngs are causing headaches for guests and park officials. Waits for rides often stretch more than an hour, and visitors are having to park in remote structures, particularly on Sundays.\n\nIndustry experts say the crowding problem leaves Walt Disney Co. with two options: Keep raising rates until attendance becomes manageable, or expand the park.\n\n## Ticket Prices Have Gone Up Already\n\nOver the weekend, the Anaheim park raised single-day ticket prices by $4 to $96. It also temporarily halted new sales of a popular annual pass for Southern California residents. Disneyland officials say they have no current plans for a new Anaheim park, but that hasn't stopped people from speculating about the possibility.\n\nThere are plans for a new, third park from back in 2000. Many longtime park watchers say now may be the time to dust off those plans. The park would be built on a 78-acre site just south of Disney's complex.\n\nThose plans were shelved while the company focused on the 2001 opening of Disney California Adventure. That park fell short of expectations until a $1 billion expansion in 2012 added the hugely successful Cars Land.\n\n## High Hopes With Marvel, Lucasfilm Characters\n\nDisney acquired Marvel Entertainment Inc. in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012. Many fans hoped a third park would feature Marvel superheroes or characters from the \"Star Wars\" franchise.\n\n\"Maybe they'll do Star Wars Land or Indiana Jones Adventure or Marvel characters,\" said Todd Regan, founder of the Disney blog site MiceChat.com. \"It will be interesting to see what happens.\"\n\nAt least for now, Disneyland officials say they are focused on expanding parking. They're buying a lot with room for 1,400 parking spaces for employees, freeing up more parking for guests.\n\n## The Visitors Keep On Coming\n\nIndustry experts say Disney might be better off focusing its attention on other theme park projects, including a $4 billion resort in Shanghai. The theme park in China is slated to open next year.\n\n\"They've got a lot on their plate,\" said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services in Cincinnati.\n\nDisneyland does not disclose attendance numbers. But estimates from Aecom, a Los Angeles engineering and consulting firm, show visitor numbers have increased nearly every year from 2004 to 2012.\n\nAnd they're continuing to rise. Disney reported an 18 percent increase in operating income from theme parks and resorts for the six months ending March 29.\n\nThe surge in Disneyland's attendance coincides with a surge in Americans spending on travel. The economy continues to rebound from the recession and a more recent lull in travel during winter storms on the East Coast and in the Midwest.\n\nSpeigel said theme parks across the country could see double-digit increases - as much as 25 percent - in attendance this year.\n\n\"We are seeing the shaping up of a tremendous 2014,\" he said.\n\n## Local Pass Holders Clogging Up The Parks\n\nIn Southern California, Universal Studios Hollywood also recently increased its one-day ticket prices, from $84 to $92.\n\nBut Disneyland's suspension of sales of its $379 Southern California Annual Passport is expected to play the biggest role in reducing crowds. The pass offered access to the park 215 days of the year, including Sundays.\n\nLocal pass holders often crowd the parks, leaving little space for out-of-town travelers who typically stay in Disney hotels and spend more on souvenirs. The program gained popularity in 2008, when the company began offering a monthly payment plan.\n\n\"Pass holders use the park differently than others,\" said Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix, an annual pass holder and chief executive of the Disney fan site MousePlanet.com. \"You go to the park like you would go to hang out at the mall with your friends.\"\n\nSuspending sales of the annual passports is an attempt to reduce Sunday numbers. Part of the idea is to encourage local residents to visit during the week, when crowds are smaller, industry experts say.\n\nDisney continues to sell a $289 annual pass - not including weekend visits - for Southern California residents. Disneyland officials say they have no plans to suspend the sales of any other passes.\n\n## Profit Obligation Versus Happy Visitor Obligation\n\nIt's not the first time Disneyland has tried to ease crowding through price increases. Two years ago, the park raised rates for one of its most expensive passes, allowing access 365 days a year, by 30 percent to $649, but it didn't work.\n\n\"It's a challenging situation,\" said John Gerner, managing director of Leisure Business Associates, a theme park consultant. \"Disney doesn't want to be seen as taking advantage of customers, but they have an obligation to try to make as much profit from their park.\"\n\nOther pass holders complained that the park has not added new attractions to justify the higher prices.\n\n\"Nothing has really changed or been added in years,\" said annual pass holder Ken Bruce, a longtime fan and visitor to Disneyland.\n\nBruce owns the cheaper Southern California annual pass that blocks out weekend admission. But he worries that Disneyland may consider suspending his pass to make room for high-spending out-of-town visitors.\n\n\"By and large, annual pass holders have a very strong emotional connection to the park and know the history,\" he said. \"To go for that blind money grab seems they are not paying attention to us.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - To lawmakers and others arguing that replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin would save the government money, the Federal Reserve says, \"Don't bet on it.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States., and it controls the country's money.\n\nA new analysis by the Fed said the old-fashioned greenback is more durable than people realize. And replacing it with a dollar coin would cost the government $1.2 billion over 30 years, because coins are expensive to produce.\n\nThe Fed study looked at the benefits and costs of moving from paper money to coins. It found that the $1 bill \"should remain in circulation and not be replaced with a $1 coin.\"\n\n## GAO Says Switch Saves\n\nSome in Congress are pushing the government to replace the dollar bill, because the dollar coin will last longer than paper money. Several countries, including Canada and Britain, and the countries that use the euro, have replaced small-value paper currency with coins.\n\nLast year, the Government Accountability Office estimated a switch could save the federal government $4.4 billion over 30 years. The GAO works for Congress, and looks into how the government spends money.\n\nThe Dollar Coin Alliance is a lobbying organization. It includes government watchdogs, transit agencies that run subways and bus lines, mining companies and vending machine groups. It is promoting an economic report that estimated a switch would save $13.8 billion over 30 years.\n\nThe organization criticized the Fed analysis. It says the central bank wants to keep the $1 bill because it profits from the sale of paper currency.\n\n\"It's no surprise the Fed is fighting currency modernization, when you understand their motives behind this report,\" said Shawn Smeallie, who runs the Dollar Coin Alliance. \"The best interests of taxpayers, not the Fed, must come first.\"\n\n## Coins Cost More To Make\n\nThe Fed issues currency through its reserve banks and orders it from the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Fed said it is not a profit-making institution. Every year it turns over any profits to the Treasury Department. In addition to printing money, the Treasury also collects taxes and pays the government's bills.\n\nThe Fed study said estimates of costs savings for a $1 coin are way off the mark.\n\nThe $1 bill is made with paper that blends cotton and linen. It is now more durable and lasts about 70 months compared with 18 months in 1990, the report said. Small-denomination bills eliminated in other countries lasted less than 20 months.\n\nAlthough a $1 coin has a useful life of 30 years, it also costs much more to produce.\n\nA $1 bill costs about 5 cents to make while a $1 coin costs about 33 cents, the Fed said. Over 30 years, the government would spend an additional $6.9 billion if it replaced $1 bills with coins.\n\nAt that cost, the government would make money on the switch only if dollar bills lasted less than 4.75 years. With a current shelf life of 70 months, or about 5.8 years, the paper currency is more efficient, the Fed said.\n\n## People Prefer Paper, Fed Says\n\nNot to mention the shift to a $1 coin would result in additional costs. Extra vault storage space at banks and equipment would cost \"perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year,\" the Fed said.\n\nFinally, the Fed said the public has shown no great love for dollar coins so far.\n\nThe latest incarnation - coins with images of American presidents - was promoted by the Fed and the U.S. Mint, but the effort failed to create demand, the report said.\n\nAs of June 30, there were 1.4 billion dollar coins sitting in Fed vaults. That is approximately a 40-year supply.\n\nThe report said polls have shown that a majority of Americans prefer the dollar bill to the dollar coin. It found that making the switch could lead more people to shun cash for credit cards and other alternative payment methods.\n\nBut the Dollar Coin Alliance said polls have shown about two-thirds of Americans support a switch to a dollar coin when told of potential budget savings.'"

            "title": "Echoes of 1953: Should Greece get the same debt deal Germany got?",
            "text": "\tLONDON - Forgiving debt, if done right, can get an economy back on its feet.\n\nA new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) argues that Greece should get help.\n\nGreece has many creditors, countries that have loaned it money. Germany is one of the biggest creditors to Greece. It is resisting forgiving Greece's debt, even though it knows better than most what debt relief can achieve. After the hell of World War II, Germany got massive help with its debt from former foes.\n\nAmong its creditors then? Greece.\n\n## Sparking The German Economic Miracle\n\nIn 1953, Greece and about 20 other countries wrote off a large chunk of Germany's loans and restructured the rest to make them easier to pay. The case of Germany shows how effective debt relief can be and helped spark what became known as the German economic miracle.\n\nSo it might seem a bit odd that Germany is now among the countries resisting Greece's requests for help.\n\nGreece now owes more than $332 billion to other countries, and its economy has fallen, as businesses suffer and people have little money to spend.\n\nHere's a look at when Germany got debt relief, and if such action might help Greece.\n\nThe London Agreement of 1953 was generous to West Germany. It cut the amount owed, extended the repayment schedule and charged West Germany low interest rates on the money it owed.\n\nIt linked West Germany's debt repayment schedule to its ability to pay. This meant that other countries had a reason to buy German goods, because this allowed Germany to pay its debt.\n\nBecause of the deal, other countries could not ask Germany to pay for the destruction the Nazis inflicted during the war.\n\n## A Case Of Politics, Not Charity, In 1953\n\nBut it wasn't a one-way street.\n\n\"The London Agreement gave Germany sweeping debt forgiveness and protection from creditors, in exchange for pro-market reforms,\" said Professor Albrecht Ritschl of the London School of Economics.\n\nWest Germany was able to borrow internationally, and because it had smaller debt payments, its economy grew strong.\n\nDevelopment activists point to that case when arguing for easier terms for troubled countries today.\n\n\"The same opportunity should be given to Greece that was given to Germany in 1953,\" said Eric LeCompte, executive director of debt relief organization Jubilee USA.\n\nThe German debt forgiveness was driven by the United States.\n\nIt wasn't charity. The U.S needed a strong West Germany as an ally against the perceived threat of the Soviet Union, and the spread of communism, which had taken hold in East Germany.\n\nYale University Professor Timothy Guinnane warns against making too many comparisons, partly because Germany was so much more important to global politics than Greece is today.\n\n## Greece Hit Hard By Depression\n\nAnd Germany had economic power. It was a major exporter, which means it sold goods it made to other countries. Greece, on the other hand, makes and exports few goods. That's partly why Germany is insisting on reforms to make Greece more competitive economically.\n\n\"The U.S. was basically the last man standing after the war and essentially decided to cut Germany's debt in half,\" Guinnane said. \"It was a hard-nosed decision ... it's wrong to say it was an act of generosity.\"\n\nStill, there are echoes from the German case that are similar to Greece's situation today.\n\nThe deal to help Germany was based on a realistic way for the country to pay its debts. Unlike Germany, Greece has had to make debt payments even though its economy was in a depression.\n\nGermany's deal after World War II also admitted that mistakes were made after World War I. Germany was punished economically by the countries that won the war, which led to extremist groups like the Nazis who became popular by pointing out how Germany had been treated. In Greece, extremist parties, including Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn, have been on the rise.\n\nOne of the reasons why relations between Greece and European creditors fell apart is the disagreement over what to do about the country's debts. It's difficult for anyone to accept a lower return on the money they loaned.\n\n## \"A Significant Haircut\"\n\nBut there are signs of movement. On Sunday, the countries of the European Union will meet to discuss a plan Greece has put forward to fix its economy and pay back part of what it is owed.\n\nThe country of Cyprus has said it could consider writing off $370 million in rescue loans to Greece. The U.S., while not directly involved, favors debt relief.\n\nThe IMF report argued that Greece needs large-scale debt relief and more than $67 billion in financing between now and the end of 2018. Given the recent economic shock, Greece's needs will likely be significantly higher, the IMF said.\n\nIt blamed the current government for being slow on reforms, but said it was clear the debt needed to be made more manageable.\n\n\"A significant haircut could possibly do it,\" an IMF official said. \"So could an extension, so Greece would not have to go back to the markets for a very long time.\"\n\nOne option the IMF mentioned was doubling the grace period on Greece's loans from EU countries to 20 years and the repayment period to 40 years.\n\n\"Greece needs a sort of breathing space,\" the IMF official said.'"

            "title": "Arctic heat release may be altering paths of hurricanes, other storms",
            "text": "\tFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - A hurricane hunter aircraft usually based in Florida was sent to conduct research flights over the Arctic this fall. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) WP-3 Orion, one of the world's premiere research planes, was there to study how lower sea ice levels could affect the weather.\n\nThe flights revealed critical information that might explain why an increasing number of tropical storms seem to be taking irregular paths.\n\nNick Bond, a scientist at the University of Washington, was a passenger on the plane during its first Arctic mission.\n\nFlying out of Alaska, Bond and other scientists studied polar ice formations in the Arctic seas, at times flying well north of the Arctic Circle.\n\n\"While we couldn't have spit on the North Pole, it wasn't that far away,\" Bond said.\n\n## Heat Released As Ice Builds Up\n\nScientists like Bond are trying to determine how much heat is released into the atmosphere when Arctic ice builds up in autumn.\n\nBond said the faster the Arctic ice builds up, the more heat is released into the atmosphere.\n\n\"We could see and feel the tremendous amount of heat coming out of the ocean,\" Bond said. \"That's what it takes to make ice, to lose heat like crazy.\"\n\nThat heat release is believed to shift the jet stream to the south. A jet stream is a fast-moving, high altitude river of air.\n\nShifting the jet stream south might be causing some serious weather changes. Scientists think the movement to the south might be slowing down or even stalling tropical systems before they can head east and out to sea.\n\nKevin Wood works at the University of Washington too. He's a research scientist, who was also aboard the plane. He said the Arctic heat release might trigger other extreme weather such as flooding or severe snowstorms.\n\n\"That's far from proven,\" he said. \"But it's one of things we're interested in understanding better.\"\n\n## Storms Heading North, Not East\n\nPrimarily, however, scientists hope the variety of sensors on board the WP-3 Orion might help them understand why Superstorm Sandy plowed into the U.S. East Coast last year. And why eight other storm systems headed toward Canada or the U.S. Northeast in the past three years.\n\n\"The very unusual path that Sandy took last year was definitely due to disruptions in the global circulation, and maybe that was related to changes in the Arctic,\" said Bond.\n\nIn October 2012, Sandy emerged in the Caribbean as a tropical storm. It then grew into a hurricane. Initially, Sandy began to curve northeast on a path that would have taken it toward the North Atlantic.\n\nBut instead, Sandy curved northwest toward the New Jersey coastline and collided with a winter system. It then swamped much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with a powerful storm surge, even though it had been downgraded to a post-tropical system just before landfall.\n\nSome other hurricanes aimed north instead of heading east in recent years. Earl hit Nova Scotia, Canada, and Igor brushed Newfoundland, Canada, both in September 2010. Irene hit the Northeast as a tropical storm in August 2011. Ophelia hit Newfoundland as a tropical storm in October 2011.\n\nIn addition to boosting the understanding of hurricane paths, the heat release study provided insight on why polar ice is melting faster, a primary reason for sea level rise and a critical issue in low-lying Florida.\n\n## \"Weather Station On Steroids\"\n\nEquipped with more sensors than a fleet of satellites, the NOAA aircraft collected a wide range of data from sea ice thickness to solar heating. Much as they do when investigating tropical storms, scientists dropped probes out of the plane to better understand the atmosphere. The devices measure temperature, wind direction and barometric pressure.\n\nScientists praised the WP-3 Orion's versatility.\n\n\"You can liken it to a weather station on steroids; you can take it anywhere,\" Bond said. \"It allows unique measurements that you can't get any other way.\"\n\nOne reason the plane, normally based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., made the Arctic trip was because the hurricane season in the Atlantic had been remarkably slow. The scientists hope next year's season will be as calm so they can hop another flight over the Arctic.\n\n\"We know we obtained data that was unique and important,\" Bond said. \"We're greedy, and we want more.\"'"

            "title": "Electric barrier not preventing fish from getting into Lake Michigan",
            "text": "\tMILWAUKEE - The electric barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is the last line of defense to stop an Asian carp invasion of Lake Michigan. It just has one problem: Fish can swim through it.\n\nAsian carp can be as big as 100 pounds and reproduce quickly. They are a problem because they eat lots of plants, freshwater mussels and can damage water quality. The government is trying to prevent them from getting into the Great Lakes where they could do major damage.\n\nThe canal connects the Great Lakes to the Illinois River, which then connects to the Mississippi River.\n\nA report by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service revealed that fish can be transported across the electrified part of the canal when they get trapped in the wake of a barge.\n\n## Schools Of Fish Getting Through\n\nResearch also shows that the metal barges can essentially suck electricity out of the water as they motor through the barrier zone. That creates a moving \"bubble\" of water that doesn't have the electrical current that's supposed to stop the fish.\n\nThe study also revealed that small fish are not always incapacitated by the electrical current in the water. In fact, a sonar camera lowered into the canal at the barrier site regularly captured schools of fish swimming freely through the barrier.\n\nThe report said that the findings showed the potential for small fish (between 2 and 4 inches in length) to pass the barrier in large groups, or schools.\n\nConcerned that the barrier was too weak to repel small fish, in 2011 the Army Corps increased its voltage. The agency had assumed that the higher voltage was strong enough to repel all sizes of fish.\n\nThe camera told a different story. Crews dropped it in the water on 72 different occasions to capture 10 minutes of video each time. Of those 72 samples, entire schools of fish, not believed to be Asian carp, were recorded swimming through the barrier 61 percent of the time.\n\nFederal officials stressed they do not believe Asian carp are yet getting past the barrier.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Asian carp are bypassing the barriers. Nor is there any indication that Asian carp are in the vicinity of the barriers,\" the report stated.\n\n## Physical Barrier Needed, Some Say\n\nThe report said that the closest adult Asian carp found in the Illinois River were about 55 miles from Lake Michigan. And, no small Asian carp have been observed closer than 131 miles from Lake Michigan.\n\nYet water samples taken at the barrier site and in stretches of canal on the Lake Michigan side of the barrier show something different. They have regularly tested positive for Asian carp DNA during the past four years. And a poisoning of the canal in the area around the barrier in late 2009 yielded the carcass of a single Asian carp.\n\nThe new study may prompt changes in the way barges are configured and how the barrier operates. Safety is also a big concern. The electrified section of canal is about 30 miles downstream from Lake Michigan, in suburban Chicago. Some barges traveling through it carry flammable materials. And the threat of sparks flying between barges is real.\n\nThe findings are still fairly new, Felicia Y. Kirkseyv said of the study. She's the aquatic invasive species program manager for the Army Corps in Chicago. \"We're going to do more analysis and work with the barge community and the Coast Guard to see how we can move forward.\"\n\nThe news comes just before the Jan. 6 release of the Army Corps' $25 million study examining how to re-establish the natural divide between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basin. When it opened over 100 years ago, the Chicago canal destroyed that divide.\n\nThe study is expected to have a range of options. But, Great Lakes advocates want the canal physically plugged to stop Asian carp and other unwanted species from swimming freely between the Great Lakes and Mississippi basin. Such a project would require significant upgrades in Chicago's sewage treatment and storm-water management.\n\nJosh Mogerman is a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council. He said news of the electrical barrier problems is further evidence that the federal government has to find a more permanent solution to the Asian carp problem.\n\n\"The electric barrier already had a spotty track record, but this report seems to burst any remaining implication it can be considered a solution to the carp invasion,\" he said. \"It reinforces the broadly held belief that a permanent, physical barrier separating the watersheds is the only way to stop the dozens of dangerous critters queued up on both sides.\"'"

            "text": "\tTEHRAN, Iran - At Friday prayer services across the nation, there were the usual shouts of \"Death to America.\" But believers also prayed for divine help with a matter that had more to do with the climate than their ideas about the United States.\n\nThe faithful prayed for rain, or at least were urged to do so.\n\n\"For God's sake, let's go to God's door and ask his Almighty to send water,\" an excited Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi begged the crowd assembled on the campus of Tehran University. This is where the nationally televised Friday prayers are normally held.\n\nThe ayatollah, or Muslim religious leader, broke into sobs from time to time as he begged the crowd to make their pleas both to God and to Imam Hussein, a respected figure in Shiite Muslim tradition. Shiites are an Islamic group that follows Shiite Islam, the official religion of Iran.\n\nThe water shortages troubling Iran, the religious leader suggested, could be a sign that heaven wanted believers to pay a little more attention to matters of the spirit.\n\n\"God sometimes sends ordeals to make his followers seek him out by praying and avoiding sin,\" the ayatollah said.\n\n## Much Of The Desert Nation Is Parched\n\nConcerns are growing about the water shortage across Iran. Water is in short supply everywhere, from the crowded, smog-filled capital and its parched suburbs to outlying towns and cities, to distant corners of the nation, much of which is desert. Lakes and rivers have been drying up, reservoirs are at all-time lows and there have been water supply cuts in some areas. The annual snow-melt from the mountains is on the decline.\n\nOn the streets here, people grumble about cuts in water service. Many buildings have tanks on the roofs to collect rainwater. Unfortunately, it hasn't rained in months. Bottled water is available for use, but many Iranians cannot afford it. Most Iranians rely on tap water for both drinking and washing.\n\n\"On some days of the week, our tap water is cut for seven or eight hours,\" said Akbar Aziz, 40, a printing-house employee who lives in the capital's working-class Khorasan district. \"We are consuming as little as possible,\" added Aziz, a father with young daughters. \"We only shower two times a week. So we are not responsible for the water shortages.\"\n\n## People Asked To Reduce Water Waste\n\nExperts say a range of factors is responsible: a lengthy drought, climate change and outdated farming and household practices that tend to waste the precious liquid. Iran regularly ranks near the bottom in global surveys of how nations manage water supplies, officials say.\n\nThe capital had a stifling hot summer, a trend that has continued deep into September and early fall. The water problem is not likely to go away anytime soon.\n\n\"In the short term there is really no solution,\" professor B. Alijani, who teaches students about climate change and geography, said in an interview. However, Alijani said that Iranians need to learn how to reduce their water use \"and avoid wasting it both at home and in the fields.\"\n\nHe noted, for instance, that farmers using irrigation to maintain orchards of apple and cherry trees that need huge amounts of water in arid areas such a Lake Urmia. The lake was once a grand body of salty water in northwestern Iran. Now, the lake is drying up as its shorelines shrink every year. Underground wells that feed water into the lake are running dry.\n\n\"Why on earth are we cultivating apples and cherries near the Urmia salt lake?\" Alijani asked.\n\n## Water Could Become Expensive\n\nThis month, Eshaq Jahangiri, Iran's first vice president, completed a tour of water treatment facilities and reservoirs in the capital.  He and others have launched a campaign to raise awareness. The country's semiofficial Fars News Agency quoted his grim calculations.\n\n\"Tehran's dams only have water for a few more days, and this means that people must take serious measures,\" the vice president warned. \"Those who use water beyond normal amounts are hurting those who abide by appropriate levels of consumption.\"\n\nThe vice president warned that water prices could rise. Authorities could be forced to make sure people cut their water use if autumn rains do not refill the reservoirs, he said.\n\nOn the horizon are ambitious plans for recycling wastewater. Plans to improve farming methods and change what many regard as wasteful personal use of water are also being considered.\n\n## A Prayer Campaign Couldn't Hurt\n\nBut Iran has little money available for massive projects designed to increase the water supply. And people are reluctant to change their habits of water usage acquired over decades and generations.\n\nThus, authorities have turned to powerful religious figures for help. A prayer campaign, officials felt, could be an effective tool to get out the message that Iran is running dry. Mohammad Hadi Heidarzadeh, the top official in charge of the environment in Teheran, wrote a letter to a Shiite Muslim religious council in charge of Friday prayers.\n\nIn his letter, he asked preachers to invite the faithful to join them in a \"rain prayer.\" Religious leaders were also asked to urge people to reduce their water usage, said the letter, which was released in the local press.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The United States is cracking down on the sale and purchase of ivory in hopes of curbing a surge in illegal poaching. The growth of such hunting is threatening to wipe out elephants and other species in Africa.\n\nThe ivory ban is a key part of a new, national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking, unveiled on Tuesday by the White House. It comes seven months after President Barack Obama issued a call to action during a visit to Tanzania. The U.S. will also seek to strengthen global enforcement and international cooperation to fight the trade.\n\nWildlife trafficking, which involves the illegal transfer of animals and animal parts, is estimated to make about $10 billion per year.\n\n\"We're seeing record-high demand for wildlife products,\" said Grant Harris, who works for the White House's National Security Council. Harris said this is because of a recent explosion in the ivory trade and wildlife trafficking.\n\n## African Animals In Grave Danger\n\nWildlife advocates are worried that without forceful global action, elephants and rhinos face [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Once numbering in the millions, Africa's elephant population has dwindled to 500,000 or less, said Dan Ashe, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. About 35,000 - or nearly 10 percent of the remaining population - are being slaughtered each year.\n\nThe illegal industry doesn't just pose a risk to endangered animals. Because wildlife trafficking is often carried out by well-armed groups in regions with weak laws and borders, U.S. officials say it poses a global security threat. The U.S. is seeking to combat growing extremism and violence in parts of Africa.\n\nThe crackdown uses laws on conservation and endangered species that have been around for years. There has been a ban on importing ivory for several decades. But these laws have not been strictly enforced, meaning that once the ivory is in the U.S., domestic sales are not really controlled.\n\nThat means someone who placed an ivory chess set for sale on eBay, for example, faced little risk of being investigated by law enforcement. This is even if they lacked proof that the item was legal. Some ivory items are allowed by law, such as if they are antiques - items more than 100 years old.\n\nAshe said that the legal trade provides a \"smoke screen\" for the illegal ivory sales. He said it also makes it more difficult for police to find the banned goods, as well as catch and prosecute the criminals.\n\n## Cutting Down Demand\n\nUnder the new rules, if someone is caught trying to sell ivory items, the government will seize them unless sellers can provide proof that they are legal. Sales across state lines will be banned except for antiques. Sales within states will also be stopped unless sellers can show they were brought into the U.S. before the ban.\n\nThe export of ivory out of the U.S. will also be banned, with very few exceptions. \"For consumers, the general message going forward is buyer beware,\" Ashe said.\n\nOfficials are confident that the crackdown will mean almost a complete ban on ivory sales. The U.S. wants to set a strict example and spur other countries to take similar steps. They hope this will drive down global demand for wildlife products and put traffickers out of business.\n\nLate last year, U.S. officials destroyed more than six tons of seized ivory tusks, carvings and jewelry. Last week, France followed suit by crushing more than three tons of illegal ivory. Other nations including Gabon and China have also taken similar steps.\n\nU.S. demand for wildlife products is surpassed only by China. There the market price for ivory is more than $1,000 a pound and has increased significantly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\n## Targeting Trafficking Rings\n\nCarter Roberts, the group's president, said that Obama and Congress have sent a very strong message to the rest of the world. This is that the U.S. will no longer allow the \"massive and senseless slaughter of wildlife or the colossal criminal profits that it generates.\"\n\nStill, the government won't seek to prosecute individuals, such as those who try to sell ivory they inherited from their parents. Instead, it will target organized trafficking rings that profit from the illegal trade.\n\nLast year, the government launched a sting dubbed \"Operation Crash.\" This went after an international smuggling ring trafficking in endangered black rhino horns. Fourteen people have been arrested during this nationwide investigation so far and seven have been convicted.\n\nWhile unveiling the plans, the Obama administration called on Congress to pass more laws to crack down on the trafficking. Congressman Ed Royce said he would review Obama's plan to ensure it is \"robust, aggressive and effective.\" And Senator Dianne Feinstein wants to be able to use laws used in drug cases in wildlife trafficking.\n\nThe Safari Club International Foundation represents trophy hunters. This group criticized Obama's plans for not looking at the relationships with African nations. Joe Hosmer, the group's president, said government actions can undermine on-the-ground conservation projects, which he argued are already working well.\n\nHosmer said that the people and the businesses in the African countries are the most important in making sure that wildlife populations are safe.'"

            "text": "\tKoalas don't hug trees because they love them - the trees keep them cool, scientists say.\n\nOn a hot day in Australia, a koala's thick fur is not an asset. The over-heated marsupials don't retreat to dens or dugouts to keep cool. And water can be hard to come by. In the wild, many koalas die when the heat becomes extreme, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters.\n\nThe authors of the study figured koalas must have some way to cool off in hot weather. To figure out what it was, they put radio collars on 37 koalas in southeastern Australia and tracked their movements during the winter of 2009 and the summer of 2010-11. In the land Down Under, summer lasts from December to March.\n\nThe researchers kept detailed records of these koalas' activities, noting their body position and their preferences for high or low branches. The scientists also used a portable weather station to record the temperature just a couple of feet from where the koalas made themselves comfortable.\n\nFor comparison, the scientists observed 130 koalas that were not wearing collars.\n\n## A Cooler Arrangement\n\nThey discovered that koalas behaved differently on hot days than on cooler days. In the summer heat, the animals arranged themselves in trees in a way that exposed more of their surface area. This often meant hugging a tree trunk or a large branch closer to the ground, with arms and legs outstretched. In the winter, koalas ventured higher up in the tree and farther out onto the branches.\n\nWhy would different parts of the tree be appealing in different seasons? To answer this question, the researchers took the temperatures of four species of trees - three eucalyptus and one acacia - at the peak of summer.\n\nUsing a thermal-imaging camera and software, they discovered that the tree trunks had lower surface temperatures than the branches or canopies. The trunks were also cooler than the surrounding air. This seemed to explain why koalas stayed closer to the base of the tree in the summer and ventured farther up the tree in winter.\n\nOf all the trees tested, the coolest ones were the Acacia mearnsii trees, the scientists found. As it happens, these were the trees where koalas spent 29 percent of their time in the summer but only 5 percent of their time in the winter. Koalas can't eat the leaves of these trees. But now scientists believe they know why the Acacia mearnsii is so appealing to koalas, especially in the summer months.\n\n## Other Animals Chill Out As Well\n\nTo make sure that their trees-as-air-conditioners theory was plausible, they came up with an equation to determine just how much heat a koala could shed by hugging a cool tree. They had to take into account the thickness of a koala's compressed fur and how much its fur conducts heat. Another factor is how much of the koala's fur touches the tree. They calculated that a 25-pound male koala could shed 68 percent of its excess heat on a 95-degree day by hugging a cool tree in a shady spot. That could mean the difference between life and death when water was scarce.\n\nIt's an ingenious strategy for chilling out. And koalas probably aren't the only animals that realize it, the researchers wrote.\n\n\"Cool tree trunks are likely to provide important microhabitat for a broad range of tree-dwelling species ... during hot weather,\" they wrote. The species would range from primates and leopards to birds and insects.\n\nKnowing this will help humans predict how animals will adapt to a warming climate. People would also have some of the information they need to decide what kinds of habitat are most critical to preserve, the researchers added.'"

            "title": "Giant Galapagos tortoise, Lonesome George, looking his most majestic",
            "text": "\tThe American Museum of Natural History will be welcoming a newcomer to its array of extinct animals. Among the fossils of long-gone gigantic sloths and knee-high horses, the newcomer is Lonesome George, the last known giant tortoise from Pinta Island.\n\nFor four decades the 100-year-old reptile served as a conservation icon on Ecuador's Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos Archipelago. The Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos is a group of islands famous for their wide variety of animals. George's subspecies was hunted for meat and tortoise oil, and nearly vanished in the 1900s. George was its only survivor, and despite several attempts to get him to reproduce with giant tortoises from similar subspecies, he died without descendants on June 24, 2012; hence his nickname, Lonesome George.\n\nWhat remains of Lonesome George's memory is a lifelike mount at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City. The exhibition was designed by a team of taxidermists. These experts take parts of the animal's body to create a statue that looks like the actual animal. The result is George looking his most majestic with neck outstretched and shell polished.\n\n## \"We Just Witnessed Extinction\"\n\nChance brought him to the museum. Fausto Llerena, George's trainer since 1983, found the tortoise sprawled out dead one morning. On that same day, a group of conservationists had just arrived at Santa Cruz Island for a citizen science workshop. Santa Cruz Island, where George drew millions of visitors over his 40-year stay there, is one of four inhabited islands in the Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos chain. The other more than three-dozen islands and islets are untouched wilderness preserves. When Llerena informed the Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos National Park Service of George's passing, they shared the sad news with their guests, many of whom began to cry. For Eleanor Sterling, a chief conservation scientist at the AMNH who arrived on the island that day, the next 24 hours were filled with disbelief. \"We just witnessed extinction,\" she says. Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos tortoises can live up to 150 years, so George's death at 100 years came unexpectedly.\n\nSterling and the other conservationists, many of whom were members of the Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos Conservancy, jumped into action. They shifted gears from conducting citizen science to making arrangements for examining George's dead body. A veterinarian was called to conduct the necropsy. They split George's shell in half with a chainsaw and determined that he had died of natural causes. Next the group needed to protect George's carcass from the 100-degree Fahrenheit tropical heat that could rot his body. After 36 hours, the bulky, 165-pound (75-kilogram) tortoise was put in a large freezer, safely wrapped and mummified.\n\n## A Very Special Preservation\n\nMembers of both the conservancy and the Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos National Park System decided the best option was to preserve George via taxidermy. They believed that a lifelike display of the extinct giant tortoise could help with conservation efforts. But the job to restore George's carcass would require a very special taxidermist.\n\nSterling recommended George Dante for the job. Dante had done the taxidermy preservation work on 8.2-foot-tall (2.5 meters) Alaskan brown bears and other creatures for the museum's North American Mammal Hall in 2012. Preserving George would be his biggest challenge since that project.\n\nAfter months of trying to get special travel permits and making the travel arrangements of shipping a frozen carcass, George finally arrived at Dante's office.\n\nFirst, Dante defrosted the corpse. After George's body thawed he measured every centimeter of the tortoise before molding a replica of the body. He filled the mold with foam, which would eventually become the base on which he would add a water-based clay to create George's features. On top of that clay he would stretch out George's skin - intact in one whole piece. His biggest challenge was working on a species that had never been mounted before. Not surprisingly, taxidermy-supply companies do not make parts for extinct giant tortoises. \"The beauty is that there's no handbook on how to do it,\" he says.\n\n## Specially Made Eyes Shine\n\nDante was well aware he was working on what he had dubbed \"the world's pet.\" As such, he knew there was no room for error. Every centimeter had to be scientifically accurate, from his saddle-back shell to the missing toenail on his left front foot. \"We couldn't just look at this as a project of mounting a Gal\\xc3\\xa1pagos tortoise.\" Dante says. \"We are re-creating this character.\"\n\nHe checked hundreds of pictures to recreate every wrinkle in George's skin. He drew green stains around George's mouth and neck to make it appear as if the tortoise had just finished grazing. And he had a glass company create the world's first pair of custom-made glass tortoise eyeballs for George, which meant visiting a local zoo to observe the intricate colors of a live tortoise's eyes.\n\nWhen it came time for a pose, Dante asked for an opinion from Fausto Llerena who was George's trainer. Llerena advised Dante to portray George in a familiar stance, with his neck outstretched in dominance and yet with his tail tucked submissively.\n\nLlerena, who is also a well-known wood carver, sent Dante a hand-carved wooden tortoise as a sign of gratitude for restoring his friend of 40 years.\n\n## Not So Lonesome George\n\nOn Sept. 18, 2014, after 500 hours of labor conducted over more than a year, Dante was finally ready to present George to the museum and the people who helped bring him there. Among the audience at George's exhibition were several people who were also present for his death, including Gibbs and Sterling. They were all pleasantly surprised with Dante's work. \"You could see the look in his eye, and you could see the pose,\" Sterling says. \"He brought Lonesome George back to life.\"\n\nSurrounded by other species lost to time, George looked a little less lonesome. But the difference between him and his neighboring specimens was not lost on anyone who attended the unveiling. The other animals in the hall were driven to extinction by changing climates. George and his kind disappeared because of man.\n\n_Editor's Note: Lonesome George is on temporary display at the museum until Jan. 4, 2015, after which he will be shipped and put on display in Quito, Ecuador._'"

            "title": "Celebrating 40 years of knowing Lucy",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - This month marks the 40th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, one of the earliest ancestors of humans. Lucy, who was about 3 feet, 6 inches tall, walked the Earth upright on two legs about 3.5 million years ago. Her 1974 discovery forever changed the understanding of where Homo sapiens came from and how they evolved.\n\nDonald Johanson is the paleoanthropologist who found the partial remains of Lucy's skeleton in the Hadar area of central Ethiopia. He and his team named the fossil after the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,\" which played repeatedly the night he made the discovery.\n\nThese days, Johanson serves as the founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. He spoke to the Los Angeles Times about Lucy's impact on paleoanthropology, the study of early humans through their fossilized bones and footprints, and what he hopes to find next.\n\n_The following interview with Johanson has been adapted by Newsela to simplify and explain some of the complicated concepts he discusses._\n\n**Q: Before Lucy, what was the accepted narrative of human evolution, the science of how living things began and evolved over time?**\n\nA: In the early 1970s when I first went into the field, there was a tug-of-war going on between Europe and Africa. Most people thought the earliest origin of humans was in Africa, but we really became human only in Europe.\n\n**Q: How did the discovery of Lucy change that?**\n\nA: She shifted, very dramatically, anthropologists' view of where we obtained our human characteristics. She showed us that it happened in eastern Africa, and more specifically in the area of Ethiopia where she was found.\n\nShe also allowed us to say conclusively that walking upright began as long as 3.5 million years ago. That was a major leap in our understanding of the sequence of events of human evolution.\n\n**Q: How do you know she walked upright?**\n\nA: Because we had her pelvis. It's a very rare discovery to find a pelvis, the ring of bones that connect the abdomen to the legs. Hers is so strikingly different from the pelvis of a four-legged animal like a chimpanzee, which has a high narrow pelvis with the hip bones facing forward. Our pelvis is squat and wide with the hip bones forming a bowl.\n\nLucy's body still had relatively short legs and relatively long arms, which is the kind of anatomy we see in more tree-living species. So she was an important bridge for us between more ancient sorts of things and more modern sorts of things.\n\n**Q: Why was upright walking an evolutionary advantage in Lucy's time?**\n\nA: Walking upright had the advantage of freeing the front limbs for other things. This allowed early humans to carry food back to a home base and share it with members of one's own tribe or band.\n\nWe don't know what all the benefits were, but it was obviously a major breakthrough. The ape population has been shrinking for a long time, but there are, what, 8 billion of us today?\n\n**Q: How has the science of human origins continued to change since Lucy's discovery?**\n\nA: When I entered the field, we had maybe six or seven different fossils of early human species. Now we have 15 or 20. So what has changed is that we understand it was not a straight line from the earliest species to modern humans, and that there were many false starts.\n\n**Q: Are there major holes in the story of our origins that you would especially like to see filled in?**\n\nA: At the Institute of Human Origins we are working to answer the specific question: What are the evolutionary foundations of modern humans?\n\nThe features that distinguish us from all other animals are language, our cooperation, and a culture that allows us to make developments that build on what came before, which no single individual could make alone. So, how did all of that come about?\n\n**Q: Anything else?**\n\nA: I'd also like to know where our particular genus, a more general category than species, came from. Every person in the world now is a Homo sapien, but there were other Homo genera, too. Lucy's species, Australopithecus afarensis, died out about 3 million years ago, but the oldest evidence of the Homo genus we have is from 2.3 million years ago. That means our own genus began between 2.3 million and 3 million years ago, and that's the time period where people are looking.\n\n**Q: Is there a specific geological place where you think the answer might be found?**\n\nA: The geological strata, the layer of rock, from the 2.5-million- to 3-million-year period in the Afar region of Ethiopia north of where Lucy was found. People are also planning on looking at Kenya.\n\nThese layers are devilish to work because they don't have many fossils in them. There are some fossils, though, so it's possible that something can be found in there that could finally link Australopithecus with Homo.\n\n**Q: Some people feel that the world has been picked over, and there is nothing left to discover. Do you agree?**\n\nA: One of the changes in paleoanthropology that is so healthy is the switch from being driven by discoveries to a more analytical level of scientific research.\n\nThere are thousands of fossils in vaults throughout the world that have not been deeply studied. We can now look at the fossils and see what diets were like. We can also use computerized tomography scans, a type of X-ray, to look at teeth and what they can tell us about life histories.\n\nThere are also rock formations throughout Africa that have not been thoroughly examined, and I think new discoveries will be made that will be surprising.\n\nAs I tell my students, you are only limited by your imagination.'"

            "text": "\tIf you're looking for hot spots of diversity, look to the Earth's warm, sweaty midsection. A new study analyzed the evolution and extinction rates of nearly all mammal species on Earth. It found the tropical regions near the equator both produce new species faster and lose them more slowly.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal PLOS Biology. They show that the tropics have been a major source of biodiversity for the cooler, more moderate regions of the planet.\n\nBiodiversity, short for biological diversity, describes the variety of living things like plants, animals and organisms that inhabit a particular area or region of the Earth.\n\nScientists have long noticed that tropical ecosystems are rich with different kinds of animal species whereas ecosystems in colder regions have far less diversity. Nevertheless, they've been unable to agree why it is so.\n\n## Cradle Or Museum ...\n\nIs it because species develop faster when they live in the warm, wet regions near the equator, making it a \"cradle\" of biodiversity? Or is it simply because they're less likely to go extinct there - making it a \"museum\" of biodiversity?\n\nEither way, many scientists suspect that the tropics are acting as a source of biodiversity for other parts of the planet. In other words, many species develop in the tropics and then spread outward from the equator to higher, cooler latitudes. But not all researchers agree on why this is.\n\nThe authors of the study published in PLOS Biology say there are many different theories. \"Over 100 hypotheses\" have been proposed to explain species movement from tropical areas of the Earth toward polar regions.\n\nSo the researchers from the Ecole Polytechnique and the National Museum of Natural History in France decided to compare different types of mammals. There are more than 4,000 different species of mammals. Because of this, scientists have classified mammals into 19 different orders with certain characteristics that define each order or group of mammals.\n\nResearchers compared eight, species-rich mammalian orders. Those eight orders or groups of different mammals with certain characteristics make up 92 percent of all mammals living on Earth.\n\nThe researchers then analyzed speciation rates to see how often new species come into being. They also analyzed their extinction rates. In addition, researchers looked at how likely it was for each mammal to spread outside of the tropics toward the temperate zones.\n\n## ... Or Maybe Both\n\nThe researchers found that in the tropics, both the \"cradle\" and \"museum\" explanations were true. In the tropics, rates of new species forming were higher while rates of extinction were lower, leading to higher rates of diversity. For almost all of the eight species-rich mammalian orders, the diversity in the tropics was higher than in the temperate regions.\n\nOne exception was the order Lagomorpha, which includes hares, rabbits and pikas. This may be because these adorable-eared animals actually emerged in the temperate regions and are better suited for grassland dwellings.\n\n\"These results suggest that tropical regions are not only a reservoir of biodiversity, but also the main place where biodiversity is generated,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nIt's not clear exactly why that's the case. It could be, to name a few ideas, because the climate in the tropics is more stable, because there are more ecological niches available to newly emerging species, or because of all that energy in the form of year-round direct sunlight. Any combination of such explanations could be true, and will require further research.\n\n\"Mammals are one of the most charismatic and well-documented groups of living organisms,\" the study authors wrote. They went on to explain that their vision of mammalian evolution on a large scale \"continues to change drastically as new data are compiled and new methods are developed.\"'"

This was about 1,000 more than the previous record, set in 2010.\n\n\"Counting this many manatees is wonderful news,\" said Richard Corbett, who is chairman of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \"The high count this year shows that our long-term conservation efforts are working.\"\n\nBut some conservationists, who are people who work to protect animals, plants and natural resources, say not so fast.\n\nBiologists suspect that warm temperatures helped the state get the high tally by bringing the slow-moving and portly mammals to the surface where they could soak up the sun, making it possible for them to be seen by counters.\n\n## The Endangered Species Debate\n\nEven though the new survey results seem positive, some conservationists are concerned. Patrick Rose is the executive director of the Save the Manatee Club, an organization started in the 1980s by musician Jimmy Buffett, who is famous for the \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" song, and former Florida Governor Bob Graham. He said that numbers alone do not mean a healthy future is guaranteed for the manatee.\n\n\"I want to finish the job before people misunderstand what a count like this means,\" he explained. He worries that the survey results will persuade the U.S. government to decide that manatees do not need to continue to be protected. \"It's good news, but it doesn't mean we're done.\"\n\nSome disagree and think that the rules protecting manatees should become less strict. Last spring, a group of boaters in Crystal River joined forces with the Pacific Legal Foundation to appeal to federal wildlife managers to consider taking manatees off the federal government's list of endangered species and putting them on the list of threatened animals. This may seem like a small change, but it would alter the rules protecting manatees. The groups in favor of making this change point out that a 2007 review found manatees were rebounding.\n\nIt is up to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to decide whether manatees are \"endangered\" or \"threatened.\" Spokesman Chuck Underwood said the USFWS expects to make a decision later this year. Along with the manatee population, the agency will consider the survival rates of adults, the areas where manatees can live, and the availability of warm water.\n\nManatees have been a protected species for more than a century. Florida first began protecting manatees in 1893. In 1967, the federal government included the Florida manatee among 78 original species listed under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n## Man's Inhumanity To Manatees\n\nFlorida started annual statewide surveys of the manatee population in 1991, using airplanes to count manatees from overhead. It is not an easy task. Weather prevented counts during the last two years, said Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Brandon Basino. Biologists try to cover much of the state in just a few days in an attempt to ensure that they count each manatee only once. This year, a team of 20 counted 3,333 manatees on Florida's East Coast and 2,730 on Florida's West Coast, Basino said.\n\nKeeping track of the manatee population is important because people have put the animal in jeopardy. Since 1974, about 41 percent of manatee deaths have been linked to human activity. More than a third of the deaths were tied directly to boat collisions. In recent years, deaths have been increasingly caused by pollution.\n\nRose said the rise in the number of manatees has come despite continuing threats from boat traffic and loss of their natural habitat, or environment. These are issues that state lawmakers have done little to control, according to Rose. Boats are still a serious threat. Some areas where manatees used to live have become inhospitable. In 2014, a total of 276 manatees died after a toxic red tide spread across the Gulf of Mexico. Another 100 manatees died on the East Coast after algae infested lagoons.\n\n\"The process is getting harder and harder,\" Rose said. \"The votes that have been taken over the years have been more lip service than really securing the future.\"'"

            "text": "\tThey haven't found any little green men yet, but scientists now believe there could once have been life on Mars.\n\nNASA's Curiosity rover landed on the Red Planet in August 2012 to explore and look for signs of living things. Last Monday, scientists said it had found the remains of an ancient lake that was filled with just the right chemical ingredients for life to thrive.\n\nThis existed billions of years ago at around the same time that early life was just taking hold on Earth.\n\nDrilling into dry rock, the Curiosity rover discovered that Gale Crater was once watery. It might have been surrounded with ice and snow. This could have hosted an entire Martian world based on a type of microbe found in caves on Earth. These simple lifeforms, called chemolithoautotrophs, feed on chemicals found in rocks and make their own energy.\n\n## Perfect Place For Life On Mars\n\n\"Ancient Mars was more habitable than we imagined,\" said California Institute of Technology geologist John Grotzinger. He is lead scientist for the Curiosity mission. This wet, potentially Earth-like environment could have lasted for tens of millions of years. That could have given it a wide-open window for life to emerge.\n\nThe findings were announced on Dec. 9 in San Francisco and impressed scientists who were not involved with the mission. \"They're really quite amazing,\" said Malcolm Walters, an astrobiologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia who helped find some of the earliest fossils on Earth.\n\nWalters said we now know much more about the chemistry of Mars. He called it a \"great leap forward.\"\n\nThe history of the planet is written in its many layers of rock, and Curiosity set out to read this story. The rover's main goal was to search for life-friendly environments at Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mountain. Mount Sharp's rock can possibly reveal many details about the planet's environment over billions of years.\n\n## Digging Down Into An Ancient Lake\n\nBut rather than head straight to Mount Sharp, the rover took a months-long detour to an interesting spot called Yellowknife Bay. There, Curiosity drilled into two rocks, named John Klein and Cumberland.\n\nIt was a risk to turn away from the planned mission, and it paid off, Grotzinger said.\n\nThe rocks, dated to roughly 3.6 billion years ago, have turned up a huge amount of the chemicals and elements needed for life. These include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus. The rocks also revealed signs of many compounds that could have provided fuel for living things.\n\nWhat's more, the water that was once there would have been drinkable. Water detected by another NASA rover on the other side of the planet was too acidic to be drinkable.\n\nDavid Catling, a scientist at the University of Washington, believes that the water in the lake would have been suitable for a wide range of simple lifeforms. The water found in a different part of the planet was only suitable for those that can survive salty, acidic environments.\n\n## Still Missing A Piece Of The Puzzle\n\nCuriosity has not yet found any organic carbon, which is a vital part of supporting life on Earth. That may be because the rover heats up soil samples to test the gases they contain. And this test may destroy some important information in the process.\n\nLife could certainly evolve and thrive without this organic carbon. In a past watery environment, chemolithoautotrophs would have done just fine with the ingredients already found on Mars. That said, scientists do want to find organic carbon because it would mean that the planet once had a wider range of life-friendly places.\n\nBut scientists feared that the planet's surface had been exposed to cosmic radiation - high-energy particles that travel through space - for far too long. This would mean that any traces of organic carbon within the reach of Curiosity's drill were long gone. Scientist Kenneth Farley said it was \"a pretty serious concern\" that all of this material had been destroyed over billions of years.\n\nSo Farley directed Curiosity to analyze several soil samples and found gases that helped pin down the age of the Martian surface. It was only about 78 million years old, much younger than scientists had expected. That meant the amount of cosmic radiation exposure was also lower than they had expected.\n\n## Moving As Fast As Curiosity Can\n\nThe team then noticed a small cliff, called a scarp, located some distance from where Curiosity landed. The scientists realized that the edge of the scarp had once covered the rocks they were sampling, but over time the cliff had worn away, exposing the new rock underneath.\n\nWhile the rover couldn't dig underneath the scarp, it could drill right by the base of it. This meant the scientists could test where radiation exposure was still very low. If any organic carbon exists in Gale Crater, the foot of one of these cliffs would be the best place to search for it, the scientists believed.\n\nThe scientists plan to take this information and run with it. But, they can only run as fast as the rover's top speed (of just 1.57 inches per second on flat ground) will allow.\n\nIn about two months, Curiosity will take a detour to an interesting cliff called KMS-9, Grotzinger said on Monday. Scientists are not sure whether it held a lake, but they hope to ride right up to a protected spot of rock and then use Curiosity's drill for more testing.\n\n\"You just never know what you'll encounter,\" said NASA scientist Douglas Ming, who led the study. \"One thing I've come to expect, doing Mars research, is to expect the unexpected.\"'"

            "title": "Curiosity doesn't kill the cat, it makes fascinating discoveries about Mars",
            "text": "\tA series of recent discoveries has scientists revising their image of Mars: They are now beginning to suspect that the Red Planet's geology may be more complex and Earth-like than previously imagined. New data suggests that the planet may have small bits of water spread around its surface. And it now seems that the planet's interior could once have been more geologically mature than previously thought.\n\nThe new data is courtesy of NASA's Curiosity, a car-sized robotic rover that has been exploring parts of the surface of Mars. Launched in 2011, the highly sophisticated vehicle is armed with an impressive arsenal of scientific instruments. In 2012, it landed in Mars' Gale Crater.\n\nWhat has scientists excited is that Curiosity has detected traces of water. This water is chemically bound to the Martian dust that seems to be covering the entire planet. The finding is among several in the five studies published Thursday by the journal Science. It may explain mysterious water signals picked up by satellites in orbit around Mars.\n\nThe soil that covers Mars' surface in Gale Crater seems to consist of two major types, according to data from the rover's laser-shooting Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument. One is a coarse soil with millimeter-wide grains that probably came from the rocks around them. The other is very fine, with grains often a few micrometers in size.\n\n## Hydrogen Detected In Dust\n\nThe fine-grained soil doesn't really match the rocks around it, said Pierre-Yves Meslin, who led one of the studies. But it does seem to match the stuff found at sites where other rovers and landers touched down. That means it's probably distributed over much or all of the planet. Most likely it is kicked up and carried far in the fierce dust storms that can shroud the planet in a reddish haze.\n\nThe researchers say they don't know where that soil comes from. It may either be created in many places, or have one source that gets picked up and blown all over.\n\nEither way, it's a handy, naturally averaged sample of the Martian surface.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing thing about this fine soil is that ChemCam's readings detected a hydrogen signal. Water, of course, is two-thirds hydrogen. This could explain why satellites orbiting Mars have picked up a mysterious water signal in the past, Meslin said.\n\n\"It's actually kind of exciting because it's water yet again on Mars, but it's in a different material than we had recognized,\" said geologist John Grotzinger, the mission's project scientist. \"So what Curiosity is doing is just demonstrating that water is present in a number of ways. It just adds to the diversity.\"\n\n## CheMin And SAM Instruments\n\nHowever, a study based on data from another of Curiosity's instruments came up with different results. The rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) tool - part of the dirt-digesting lab in its belly - found no sign of water in soil samples taken from a sandy dune dubbed Rocknest. That's because CheMin uses X-ray diffraction to bounce high-energy light off of a mineral's crystalline structure. If the soil isn't in crystalline form, there's no way for CheMin to see it.\n\nAll this means the hydrogen signal seen by ChemCam must have been coming from the non-crystalline portion of the soil, said David Bish, who led the CheMin study. This so-called amorphous portion makes up a significant part of the soil.\n\nSure enough, when Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument cooked up a tiny sample of soil in its little oven, it turned out that roughly 1.5 to 3 percent was made of water. The scientists think this water may have come from the atmosphere - that is, it might have been pulled out of Mars' thin air.\n\nBut while traces of water were found in the soil, Curiosity found no signs of minerals that had been formed in water. This was interesting, said Bish, as \"one of the reasons for going to Gale Crater\" was the assumption that it might be a good place to find clays containing such minerals. Inside Gale Crater lies a 3-mile-high mountain called Mt. Sharp, whose layers could be rich in clays. These might hold answers to whether Mars was once hospitable to life.\n\nIt's possible that the fine-grained soil on the surface of Mars is simply too young to have ever encountered liquid water, he said. If so, it would mean that many years passed between the formation of the water-rich clays locked inside of certain rocks and the dusty grains that currently cover the Martian surface.\n\n## \"A More Evolved Planet\"\n\nAnother of the studies focused on the rock known as Jake M, named after NASA engineer Jake Matijevic, who died shortly after the rover landed in 2012. Jake M is unlike any volcanic rock seen on Mars: It's rich in alkaline magma. This told the researchers that it had been created under high pressure - and perhaps in the presence of water, said Edward Stolper, lead author of the study.\n\nIn fact, it looks something like an uncommon rock on Earth called a mugearite. This is found on ocean islands and near underwater volcanos.\n\nThe rock's composition also told scientists that it was clearly made of the leftovers after other minerals in the Martian magma had crystallized out - that is, hardened into crystalline forms. That led them to believe that the heating and cooling and movement of magma that used to occur beneath Mars' mantle were a lot more complicated than they had thought.\n\n\"We see evidence for a more evolved planet,\" Grotzinger said, \"so it looks like it was headed in more of a direction like Earth.\"'"

            "title": "NASA says future astronauts to Mars will likely have drinking water there",
            "text": "\tNASA announced new evidence that could confirm there is liquid water on Mars, increasing the possibility that future astronauts journeying to the Red Planet could rely on the planet's own water for their drinking needs.\n\nLiquid water is a popular topic, said Lujendra Ojha, the Georgia Tech Ph.D. candidate who led the research. \"We're like the thousandth time someone has discovered water on Mars.\"\n\nThere's a good reason that liquid water is so popular: Mars is now the only planet in our solar system to show evidence of water on its surface, other than Earth. Other worlds have water in subsurface oceans, or scattered around as vapor in the atmosphere. But Mars is the only place where there is solid evidence for liquid that sits right there in the open air.\n\n## Where There's Water, Could There Be Life?\n\nIt would be a major leap to suggest that Mars may have life on it, even microbial life. But liquid water at least makes it possible that parts of the planet are livable.\n\nThe study builds on research from last April. Scientists using information from the Curiosity rover noted that the planet had the seasonal potential for liquid water. The Curiosity rover is a robotic, automated vehicle that explored Mars. Because of the extremely low pressure on Mars, water has a boiling point of just a few degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates. The April study noted the presence of perchlorates - a kind of salt - which could make the boiling point of Mars's water much higher, theoretically allowing it to remain liquid. They proposed that the planet's temperature would be right for liquid, perchlorate-filled water to form every day during winter and spring.\n\nIn theory, water that periodically turned liquid before evaporating could form geographic features. Such features are often spotted on the planet and look like the slow movement of dark, damp sand, which are called recurring slope lineae (RSL).\n\n## Evidence Builds\n\nIn the new study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, a different group of researchers took the search for perchlorates one step further. They went looking for them in the very RSL features thought to be formed by salty liquid. They found perchlorates in abundance, and it seems like they have been getting hydrated.\n\nOjha and his colleagues used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to check out the chemical composition of the wet-looking streaks. The MRO is a spacecraft designed to study Mars from high up in the orbit. They used a method called spectroscopy, which keeps track of what type of light an object absorbs to make conclusions about its composition. With this method, scientists can identify glass, ice and other substances from miles above the surface.\n\n\"We're going to places where we thought we were seeing the presence of water and finding chemical evidence of perchlorates,\" Ojha said. And the correlation goes further than that: The hydrated salts seem to disappear in areas where RSL were not forming anymore, or were shrinking.\n\n\"We're observing the leftover molecules of water in the salt,\" Ojha said. \"We're finding evidence that they're getting hydrated.\"\n\n## Still More Work To Be Done\n\nMorten Bo Madsen of the University of Copenhagen, who co-authored the April study, but was not involved in the latest work, said the new results were significant. \"(The) flow of liquid salty water is no longer just a possibility, it does actually occur,\" he told The Washington Post. \"The results shows that liquid does indeed flow on Mars today.\"\n\nOjha's work confirms that hydrated salts seem very likely to have something to do with the formation of the wet-looking streaks on Mars. But there is more work to do to confirm the presence of liquid water itself. Ojha pointed out that the MRO's resolution is too low to pick up many of the smaller \"wet\" features on Mars, and that a new orbiter could get even more information. The MRO only allows us to examine Mars's surface at what Ojha believes is the driest point in the day. Eventually, the hope is that a rover can take a closer look at the streaks themselves.\n\n## Not So Science Fiction Anymore\n\nIf liquid is truly forming on the surface because of these salts, it could still easily evaporate - it should evaporate at just 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) or so. But it could create pockets of the planet where microbes can survive, even today.\n\nIn theory, it could be extracted and used by astronauts on a Mars mission. Perchlorates could be helpful in their own right, too. They can be used to make rocket propellant.\n\n\"If we ever go there, we could probably utilize this. We wouldn't have to bring tons of water,\" Ojha said. \"This stuff seems like science fiction, but in 100 years or so it could be fact.\"'"

Yet the Red Planet at one time apparently had rivers and lakes, which suggests it also once had a much thicker atmosphere.\n\nEarth's thick atmosphere of gasses traps heat from the sun and allows life to survive. Mars once had an atmosphere like that, and Mars was warm and wet - but now it is cold and dry.\n\nWhere did this thick Martian atmosphere go? Solving that mystery is the main goal of NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, which arrived in orbit around Mars on Sept. 21.\n\n## MAVEN Pulled Into Orbit\n\n\"One of the really overarching questions about Mars is whether there was ever life,\" MAVEN's principal investigator Bruce Jakosky said last week. Life, most scientists assume, would have required liquid water - as all life on Earth does.\n\nMAVEN will measure Mars' current atmosphere. Scientists will then use those measurements to try to understand what might once have been there and how it was lost.\n\nMAVEN has been traveling toward Mars since its launch 10 months ago, in November 2013. On Sunday night, it completed a tricky move that allowed Mars' gravity to pull it into orbit. Over the next six weeks, MAVEN will gradually lose altitude.\n\nEventually, its current 35-hour orbit will become a tighter circle-like orbit that takes just four and a half hours to complete. Its instruments will begin taking scientific measurements in November.\n\n## India's Orbiter Due To Arrive\n\nIf all goes well, MAVEN scientists will coordinate with the researchers behind India's Mars Orbiter Mission, which is due to arrive on Sept. 24. While MAVEN will focus just on Mars' upper atmosphere, the Indian mission will be broader: It will record images of the planet's surface and atmosphere.\n\nMars Orbiter's science capabilities are simple compared to MAVEN's. Still, if it succeeds in reaching Mars, it will make history as the first Asian spacecraft to do so. \"Both India and NASA are really quite interested in cooperating,\" said Jim Green, the director of NASA's planetary science division.\n\nMars' thin atmosphere is 95 percent carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, argon, oxygen and other chemicals. Scientists have two main possible explanations for how the bulk of the atmosphere could have escaped: It could have seeped down through the surface to the planet's crust, or floated up and been lost to space.\n\nFor clues, MAVEN will watch to see when and how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere. The process is thought to be driven by solar wind, but other forces could be at work as well.\n\n## Siding Spring Comet Is Coming Too\n\nMAVEN will get a bonus in the form of comet C/2013 A1 - also known as Siding Spring. By chance, the comet will cruise to within 80 miles of Mars on Oct. 19. Cometary dust and gas that strike Mars' atmosphere should provide information about the composition of both the comet itself and the Martian atmosphere. \"The odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one in a million years,\" Jakosky said. \"It's really luck that we get the opportunity here.\"\n\nMAVEN is the latest phase in an all-out scientific effort aimed at increasing our understanding of Mars. MAVEN will join NASA's two other orbiters - the Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance - as well as the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers, which drive along the planet's surface. Europe's Mars Express orbiter is the only other spacecraft currently at the planet.\n\nThe various missions not only aim to understand whether life could ever have existed on Mars. They are also laying the groundwork for future human exploration.\n\n\"This is our next big step on our journey to Mars,\" Jakosky said. MAVEN and other missions \"are blazing the trail for us to understand everything about Mars that we need to for humans to be able to land safely.\" In NASA's eyes, every bit of information brings us closer to the day when humans first walk upon the surface of the Red Planet.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Planetary scientists dream of sending a geologist to Mars to study its rocks by hand. Until then, they have to settle for examining meteorites - chunks of the Red Planet that land on Earth after hurtling through space and surviving the searing fall through our atmosphere.\n\nThough a little banged up, these meteorites provide a vital up-close view of our rust-hued neighbor. But it can be hard for geologists to interpret what they see when they can't agree on how old a rock is. Conflicting age estimates for certain rocks differ by up to 4 billion years - the vast majority of Mars' planetary existence.\n\nDo these rocks tell the beginning, or the end, of Mars' story?\n\nIn a paper last month in the journal Nature, an international team of scientists sought to sort this out for a particular group of meteorites known as shergottites. Martian space rocks tend to be very old, but shergottites are thought to be remarkably young.\n\n## Formed When Dinosaurs Roamed Earth\n\nMost scientists believe the shergottites were formed as a result of volcanic activity about 150 to 250 million years ago. This would place their formation during Earth's Jurassic period, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\n\nIf so, shergottites are a sign that Mars might have been geologically active fairly recently. That in turn means it might still have been hospitable to some form of life, said Munir Humayun, a planetary geochemist at Florida State University who was not involved in the study.\n\nBut a few researchers recently estimated that shergottites are actually about 4 billion years old - a finding that had far-reaching implications for scientists' understanding of Martian history. \"Most of us understand that if there is to be life on Mars, it's not going to be roaming on the surface. ... but it could be thriving underground with the heat energy provided by volcanism,\" Humayun said.\n\nHowever, \"if there hasn't been [volcanic activity in] 4 billion years, ... it would be very difficult to believe there was life left on Mars.\"\n\nTo settle the question, Desmond Moser of Western University in Ontario, Canada had his team examine a meteorite known as Northwest Africa 5298. They looked at very tiny deposits within it called baddeleyites. These tough, zirconium-rich minerals are \"10 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair,\" said study co-author Axel Schmitt, a geochemist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n## A Tough Tiny Mineral In Meteorites\n\nResearchers generally measure relative amounts of pairs of radioactive elements in rocks to gauge how long a rock has been around since it fully crystallized. But that isotopic ratio can be reset by a big impact that melts the rock down, erasing the geochemical trail.\n\nThat's why scientists picked the tiny baddeleyites: Once they form, they are durable little minerals. It's not easy to melt them down and reset their isotopic clock. By looking at the isotopic ratios of radioactive uranium and lead in this tough rock, the scientists found that it formed about 187 million years ago, give or take 33 million years. This confirmed that the baddeleyites were young.\n\nThe scientists could also see evidence of the damage done to the meteorite by the event that may have released it from the Martian surface sometime around 22 million years ago. The shock from that impact muddled up the mineral structure inside, while keeping the chemicals themselves mostly intact. The result was something like shaking up a sealed gift box of chocolates.\n\n\"It looks good on the outside, but all the pieces are dislodged on the inside,\" Schmitt said. The study further shows that the shergottites weren't old rocks, Humayun said. But that was what he had expected. \"If they had found that it was 4 billion years old, I would eat my hat,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers say they can use their method of dating these rocks to study other Martian meteorites. Their hope is that it will reveal new information about the Red Planet's geophysical inner life.'"

Some of these gases are believed to cause [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming). The effect of those gases could change weather patterns and nature.\n\nBuilding up the fake meat industry may also cushion the blow from a meat shortage predicted to occur by midcentury.\n\nBeyond Meat and other makers of such substitutes are chasing increasingly picky taste buds by cooking up grub that captures more of the bite and appearance of animal flesh.\n\nAll are fighting for a piece of the meat-alternatives market, which has grown 8 percent from 2010 through last year to $553 million, according to research firm Mintel.\n\n## \"We All Crave Grease\"\n\nJanet Corvin, 52, has been a vegetarian since she was a child, but still desires the taste and texture of meat. She turns to the fake stuff at least six times a week. Vegetables alone just won't do.\n\n\"It's got a flavor and texture we all learn to like,\" Corvin said recently as she stood in front of the mock-meat section at a Whole Foods in Glendale, Calif. \"It's salty; it's greasy.

Just don't have it every day.\"\n\nThe United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization projects global meat consumption will rise 73 percent by 2050. The increase would put massive strains on the world's water and grain supplies.\n\n\"Put simply, there's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people,\" the expected global population then, Gates wrote in a blog post titled \"The Future of Food.\" He added, \"Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. We need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources.\"\n\nBeyond Meat and others are betting on a shift in consumer attitudes. Protein is so prized in these low-carb times that it's perfectly normal to see it marketed in forms other than meat - even a Baby Ruth candy bar.\n\n## T-Bones Trump Tofu\n\nBut this hasn't necessarily led to horde of Americans giving up pork chops and bacon-wrapped hot dogs.\n\nA Gallup poll last year placed the percentage of vegetarians in the U.S. at 5 percent. It was 6 percent in 1999. The meat industry doesn't expect that to change in the near future.\n\n\"It's hard for me to imagine that tofu or tempeh will compete with T-bones any time soon among people who enjoy the beefy taste and texture of a steak,\" said Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute.\n\nBrown, 42, agrees that his biggest challenge is re-creating that experience.\n\nHe grew up visiting a dairy farm that his father ran as a hobby. He started cutting back on meat at 13 and has been a vegan the past 12 years.\n\nHaving worked for a Canadian energy company, he became engrossed in the link between industrialized livestock and climate change.\n\nIn 2006, the United Nations estimated that the livestock industry produced 18 percent of the world's emissions each year - more than cars, trains and planes combined. In 2009, former World Bank environmental advisor Robert Goodland placed the industry's share of annual global emissions at 51 percent, saying the U.N. had underestimated methane and other pollutants.\n\nSuch studies prompted Brown to invest in vegan restaurants in the Washington area in 2006. The menu featured sandwiches stuffed with wheat gluten patties and Chinese popcorn \"chicken\" smothered in brown sauce.\n\n## Something Was Missing\n\nDemand was growing. But he didn't think any of the food was good enough to eat without heavy seasoning or sauce.\n\nThen he came across a research paper written by Fu-hung Hsieh and Harold Huff at the University of Missouri, an institution that prides itself on its agricultural programs, particularly meat.\n\nHsieh and Huff spent years seeking the holy grail of imitation meat: an indistinguishable fake. The team developed a method that broke down soy proteins by alternating high temperatures with high pressure. The trick was finding the right combination of the two.\n\nPressed through a large, stainless steel machine, the proteins ooze out like pale Play-Doh. Constant tinkering brings the sludge closer to the feel of real chicken.\n\nBrown was impressed. He struck a licensing agreement in 2010 to use the technology.\n\nStores will soon be offering Beyond Meat's new line of imitation cooked ground beef. The company also is exploring chicken nuggets and fake drumsticks.\n\n\"We're not trying to get people to eat kale and quinoa,\" Brown said. \"We're just trying to get your kids and my kids to have a healthier chicken nugget.\"'"

            "title": "Scientists say rising sea levels in Florida provide clue to climate change",
            "text": "\tMIAMI - Archaeologists digging near the mouth of the Miami River have unearthed more than they bargained for: strong evidence that South Florida's sea level is rising.\n\nThe evidence consists of 10 bricks, an iron plate and some coconut palms.\n\n\"It's the first line of evidence something had really changed here in terms of sea level,\" archaeologist Bob Carr said Tuesday. Carr was speaking at the Met Square construction dig on downtown Miami's Fourth Street. His team is there to excavate a 2,000-year-old Tequesta Indian village buried on land where a hotel and other buildings are being put up.\n\n## The Ocean Is Rising\n\nThe bricks Carr and his team discovered date to the 1860s. They were dug up about four months ago along a slice of old shoreline long buried a few feet deep under a parking lot. The find was not unexpected - Carr knew Fort Dallas occupied the site in the 1800s.\n\nWhat surprised Carr was that he discovered the bricks about a foot below the water table. Just under the area where soil becomes soaked with water is the water table. In areas that are on the coast, a rise in sea level creates a rise in the level of the water table. Neither the bricks nor coconut palms would have existed on submerged land. Therefore, they provide proof that sea level in the area had risen more than a foot in the last century.\n\nThis is proof of a change in sea level, Carr said as he toured the site.\n\n## Clue To Climate Change\n\nScientists say that rising sea levels is related to climate change. They say the steady rise in average temperature known as global warming is caused by pollution. In particular, emissions containing carbon have been a problem. A lot of factories were built in the 1800s. They burned coal, which emits a lot of carbon into the air. Later on, automobiles also emitted a lot of carbon.\n\nClimate change has occurred naturally over thousands of years. But once factories began pumping pollution and carbon into the atmosphere, temperatures started rising, said geologist Hal Wanless. Later on, automobiles began emitting carbon too. Finding the bricks supports the theory that sea levels started rising quickly in South Florida because of the increase of carbon, he said.\n\nWhile scientists were already thinking that Florida sea levels were rising, finding historic evidence is rare.\n\nIn the 1800s, most people in Florida lived on a thin strip of high ground between the Everglades and Biscayne Bay. There are not a lot of signs of men living in Florida, except for at the Miami River.\n\n## Tribal Ceremonial Sites\n\nCarr began examining the downtown site in 2004, two years after plans to build the hotel and other buildings were announced.\n\nCarr eventually found 11 ceremonial sites, along with human remains. He also unearthed a trove of shells, pottery shards and discarded bones that provides a glimpse into the daily life of the Tequesta Indians who used to live there.\n\nCarr also expected to find remnants of the army fort and of a later hotel, built at the end of the 19th century. They also found some unexpected discoveries in a slice of excavated bank now well below the water table. They discovered a brick pier that was possibly part of a building foundation, and an iron plate and coconut palms.\n\n## Turtle Bones And Conch Shells\n\nWorkers digging across the site have little by little removed some soil to reveal a sloping bank. They have found turtle bones, conch shells fashioned into shovels and shards of a distinctive pottery used by the Tequesta Indians.\n\nCarr and his team have also unearthed tens of conch shells in their natural state. Scientists will be able to study these to determine changes in the environment and to \"reconstruct early history.\"\n\n\"We're getting pieces of an ancient jigsaw one post at a time,\" he said. \"It's a huge reservoir of scientific information about the environment and prehistoric Miami.\"'"

            "title": "Tiny microbes of death nearly wiped out life on Earth, study suggests",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Tiny microbes on the bottom of the ocean floor may have been responsible for killing off most of the life on Earth a long time ago, according to a new study.\n\nThese microbes of death were so small, that 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean sediment.\n\nBut scientists suggest that they may have caused the end-Permian extinction, the most catastrophic mass extinction the Earth has ever seen. It started roughly 252 million years ago - long before the dinosaurs - and it continued for 20,000 years. By the time it was over, nearly 90 percent of all life on Earth had been destroyed, the scientists say.\n\n\"It was not as dramatic as the impact that probably killed the dinosaurs, but it was worse,\" said Gregory Fournier, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who studies evolution. \"Things were very close to being over for good.\"\n\n## Mystery Of CO2 Rise\n\nScientists have struggled to understand exactly what caused the long, slow, mass die-off in this dark era of our planet's history. Examining layers of rocks, known as the geologic record, tells us CO2 levels rose quickly at the time. That would have caused the oceans to become more acidic and the Earth to heat up. Such conditions made the environment too harsh for most forms of life. But what actually caused the CO2 levels to rise has remained a mystery.\n\nSome scientists have suggested an asteroid could be to blame; others have proposed that volcanic activity or coal fires might be the culprit.\n\nNow, in a paper published this week, researchers from MIT and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing, China, have named a new and unlikely suspect. They blame a tiny methane-spewing microbe known as Methanosarcina.\n\nThe first clue that microscopic microbes could be involved in the greatest die-off the Earth has ever known came when MIT geophysicist Dan Rothman was looking at how carbon levels grew during this time. What he saw was not a straight line, but rather a rapid upward curve.\n\n\"If the CO2 came from the sudden combustion of a coal field in Siberia it wouldn't behave this way. It has this special character that is consistent with microbial processes,\" he said.\n\nIt was the first time anyone had suggested microbes might be involved with the end-Permian extinction, but far from the first time that microbes have been accused of changing the chemistry of our planet. For example, photosynthetic microbes are responsible for creating the first oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"It is absolutely normal that microbes are mediating the great elemental cycles,\" said Rothman. \"What they do is crucial. And if they do better or worse, things change.\"\n\nFournier put it this way: \"Microbiologists like to say, 'Microbes rule the Earth, and we just live on it.'\"\n\n## Nickel A Key To The Puzzle\n\nTo figure out which specific microbe might have a hand in this ancient catastrophe, Rothman took his research to Fournier, who had published a paper about Methanosarcina in 2008. The paper showed that sometime in the last 400 million years, Methanosarcina received a gene transfer that allowed it to produce methane more efficiently than ever before.\n\nAfter seeing Rothman's analysis, Fournier worked to figure out more precisely when the gene transfer happened. He found it most likely occurred about 250 million years ago.\n\nAlthough the researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the vast quantities of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction, they do have one more line of evidence to support their hypothesis. In order to turn acetate into methane, Methanosarcina needs nickel.\n\n\"Even if they had all the food in the world they would be limited if they were starved for nickel,\" Fournier said.\n\nBut if there was a lot of nickel around, the microbes would be unhindered. And, wouldn't you know, much of the volcanic activity at the time occurred in Siberia, which has some of the world's largest deposits of nickel. Furthermore, the researchers found an increase in nickel in sediments from that time.\n\n\"Our proposal is unusual, but it does bring together many observations, and ties a lot of stuff together,\" Rothman said. \"That doesn't make it right, but it is consistent, and that's what is necessary to move forward and provide further tests.\"'"

            "title": "Rare butterflies' habitats\u00a0\u00a0designated \"no spray\" zones in South Florida",
            "text": "\tEvery summer, South Florida residents battle swarms of mosquitoes. They do this by spraying pesticides. However, new research has found that routine spraying is causing much greater harm to innocent bystanders: butterflies.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commissioned a study to address the growing number of butterflies going extinct. Florida International University researcher Gary Rand found two common chemicals used in spraying - at amounts typically used to control mosquitoes - were toxic to butterflies. While researchers have long suspected that pesticides killed butterflies, Rand's research confirmed this and documented the deadly amounts. He also found that spraying may have lasting effects.\n\nRand and his research team spent five years studying the impact of the pesticides on butterflies. The findings resulted in federal wildlife managers deciding to increase the boundaries around endangered butterflies' habitats. This forced two counties in Florida - Miami-Dade and Monroe - to change where they spray for mosquitoes.\n\n\"It's up to us to protect them. They don't protect themselves,\" said Rand, who published his findings in three journals this spring.\n\n## More Toxicity Tests Needed\n\nRand is a toxicologist. He believes his research shows the need to broaden insect safety testing for pesticides, which currently is done only on honeybees. Pesticides have come under more and more scrutiny after the widespread collapse of the honeybee populations. However, other pollinators have suffered historic declines too, such as monarch butterflies, wasps and beetles. Since 1990, the number of monarch butterflies has dropped by 970 million, federal officials announced earlier this year.\n\n\"You can't make a blanket statement about insect testing when you only test for honeybees,\" Rand said.\n\n## Butterflies Get More Breathing Room\n\nMiami-Dade County officials agreed to increase the boundaries for spraying around three areas. Totaling nearly 2,000 acres, the areas are known to be inhabited by endangered Florida leafwing and Bartram's hairstreak butterflies. Craig Grossenbacher, chief of the county's Water Resources Coordination Division, said that Miami-Dade County also decided to stop spraying on a patchwork of environmentally endangered land inhabited by native butterflies.\n\nMonroe County is making changes, too. The county is expanding the boundaries around endangered butterflies' habitats to 400 meters for aerial spraying and 250 meters for truck fogging, said Anthony Sowers, a toxicologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n## Protecting The Public\n\nWhile the drought made this mosquito season one of the mildest in years, mosquito managers say the new rules mean they will have to work a little harder at educating the public about the risks from stagnant water. Mosquitoes use water that is stagnant, or standing still, as a place to breed.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy,\" said Chalmers Vasquez, operations manager for Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control. \"The population needs to be protected before the butterflies.\"\n\nMosquito season typically starts about two weeks after the rainy season, when salt marsh mosquitoes get blown inland from the Everglades National Park or Biscayne Bay's tangled mangroves. So far this year, Vasquez said the district has sprayed just once, at a half dozen parks, before the July 4 holiday.\n\nStanding water in pots and plants has so far posed a bigger concern.\n\nVasquez has found that the bromeliad flower is causing particular problems.\n\n## More Butterflies Land On The Endangered List\n\nRisks linked to spraying date back to at least the 1990s, when researchers began connecting the decline in butterflies to pesticides. Worry only increased in recent years as the butterfly population continued to drop. In 2013, federal officials declared two Florida species extinct. A report found three more have probably disappeared, largely the result of their habitats being razed for development and pesticide spraying.\n\nJust last year, the leafwing and hairstreak butterflies were added to the endangered species list, bringing the total number of endangered butterfly species in the state to four. Another three are considered threatened.\n\nOne solution is to do a better job of managing butterflies' habitats, particularly on Big Pine Key where Keys residents have come to rely on spraying for mosquitoes to make the summer months tolerable. Ocean winds easily carry pesticides to nearby butterflies' habitats, though, and federal officials decided it was time to take a closer look at toxicity, Sowers said.\n\n\"Everyone went into it with the understanding they are insecticides. They are insects. There is going to be some toxicity,\" he said. \"The goal was to see what type of exposure was needed for impacts to occur.\"\n\n## Without A Wing Or A Prayer\n\nFor his study, Rand selected five Florida species he purchased from a breeder in Naples. He chose the common buckeye, painted lady, zebra longwing, atala hairstreak and white peacock butterflies. Then he focused on naled, permethrin and dichlorvos, the most common pesticides used in spraying for mosquitoes across South Florida.\n\nHe coated leaves with the chemicals and used a hole puncher to create tiny servings for the caterpillars. Rand also tested exposure for butterflies by spraying them, conducting separate tests to look at what happened when the pesticides landed on their thorax or on their wings.\n\nRand found that naled and permethrin, but not dichlorvos, harmed both butterflies and caterpillars. Permethrin also tended to pose a lasting risk since it stayed on leaves longer.\n\n\"If they're spraying according to the label rate and doing a proper job, you wind up with concentrations that produce acute toxicity to a number of species,\" he said.\n\nDespite the findings, Rand said he is not opposed to pesticide use.\n\n\"I'd love for the whole world to be organic farming, but I don't think it's possible,\" he said. Instead, he said his findings should be used as a warning about how pesticides are applied. \"Everybody complains about farmers, but you've got massive amounts of spraying outside by people. What other organisms are out there being depleted that we don't know about? And we won't know until it's too late.\"'"

            "text": "\tPANAMA CITY - They've attracted names like suicide mosquitoes, dead-end bugs and even Frankenskeeters.\n\nThey're gene-altered mosquitoes and the list of countries that are testing to see whether they have a place in the public health arsenal in the war against mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever is growing. Panama is one of those countries.\n\nDengue is on the rise worldwide, with outbreaks reported this year in Texas and Florida. The mosquito that carries the dengue virus has spread to 100 countries and potentially exposes 2.5 billion people to the excruciating disease. Some 50 million to 100 million people contract dengue each year, of which about 25,000 die, the World Health Organization reports.\n\n\"A person with dengue will be prostrate for several days,\" said Dr. Carlos Galvez, the head epidemiologist for Panama's Health Ministry. \"They grow dehydrated very fast. In a matter of hours, the cases can grow more complicated.\"\n\n## Call Them The Dead-End Bugs\n\nThis has been a particularly bad year for dengue in the Western Hemisphere, with the Pan American Health Organization reporting 1.4 million cases.\n\nPanama has one of the most developed public-health systems in Latin America, a legacy of the U.S. military presence during much of the 20th century to oversee the operation of the Panama Canal. Yet even Panama struggles to cope with a type of mosquito known as Aedes aegypti. The aggressive city dweller that originally came from North Africa is the principal carrier of the dengue virus.\n\nTeams patrol the streets fumigating with insecticide in a constant battle against the mosquito. Public service ads remind Panamanians to drain standing water in eaves, buckets, flowerpots and old tires, where mosquitoes breed.\n\nBefore long, public health officials may have a new tool - OX513A - a genetically modified mosquito from a British biotech company, Oxitec Ltd., that's a spinoff from Oxford University.\n\nOxitec mosquitoes have been altered to contain a \"lethality gene.\" When the mosquitoes, all male, are released into the wild, they mate with females but the offspring don't survive. That's why they're called dead-end bugs. Only if they're exposed to tetracycline, an antibiotic, do the transgenic mosquitoes survive.\n\n## Flags Of Caution Raised\n\nIf Panama's National Biosafety Commission gives the green light, sometime early next year technicians will release tens of thousands of gene-altered mosquitoes in Arraijan. The community is across the canal from Panama City at the canal's Pacific end.\n\n\"We plan to do about 50,000 per week,\" said Dr. Nestor Sosa, the head of the Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies, a public research body. \"You have to have a proportion of at least 10 to 1 (transgenic) mosquitoes to native mosquitoes. You have to overwhelm them.\"\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the OX513A release will result in a drop in the mosquito population.\n\n\"If you lower the number of mosquitoes, you lower the possibility of infection with dengue,\" Galvez said.\n\nThe transgenic mosquitoes have generated opposition, with complaints ranging from doubts about their effectiveness to concern about whether the impact on the ecosystem has been adequately studied.\n\n\"There are scenarios in which the dengue could worsen,\" said Dr. Helen Wallace, a mathematician who is the executive director of GeneWatch UK, a British group that monitors genetic science. Wallace said that if the program succeeded in reducing the population of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, there was nothing that prevented some other type of mosquito from adapting to fill its niche and carry the virus.\n\n\"It could be harder to get rid of than the targeted mosquito,\" she said.\n\n## Even A Red Flag Hoisted, About Borders\n\nAnother critic, Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, a French-trained biosecurity expert working in Chile, said the gene-altered mosquitoes could cross international boundaries, violating international treaties on biosafety.\n\n\"All consequences that could occur are unforeseen,\" Rodriguez said. \"It's been developed very rapidly.\"\n\nA Panamanian environmental lawyer, Olmedo Carrasquilla, said his nation should use better techniques to educate the public on mosquito control.\n\n\"Why invest millions in methods and technology when there are no guarantees? When we know there are rudimentary methods that work?\" he asked.\n\nSosa, the health official, dismissed some of the criticism, especially about the transgenic mosquito's potential impact on the ecosystem.\n\n\"The mosquito dies in a few days. So it's very improbable that it will go into the environment or into another organism,\" Sosa said. \"It's not that we are doing something that is environmentally unfriendly.\"\n\n## A Rifle, Not A Blunderbus\n\nHadyn Parry, the chief executive of Oxitec, said in a telephone interview that his company thought its transgenic mosquito was safer than using insecticides, which he asserted \"affect all insects in a given area.\" Insecticides can also filter through the ecosystem and persist.\n\nBy using dead-end mosquitoes, only one species is affected, he said.\n\n\"It's a highly targeted sniper's rifle instead of a blunderbuss that takes out everything it finds,\" Parry said.\n\nMosquitoes generally spend their three-week life spans in an area 200 yards from where they were born. The Oxitec mosquitoes, he said, can always be detected.\n\n\"You can actually look at any of our insects under a fluorescent light, and you'll see a red color. This is so important when it comes to monitoring. We can tell how far our insects fly and where they are going,\" Parry said.\n\nOxitec mosquitoes have been tested in the Cayman Islands, Malaysia and Brazil, Parry said, and he expects tests in India and in the Florida Keys, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Florida authorities give final approval.\n\nIn tests earlier this year in the village of Mandacaru, in Brazil's northeastern Bahia state, Oxitec reported 96 percent suppression of the dengue mosquito.\n\nHealth experts say they need additional tools to combat dengue, and they encourage the global pharmaceutical companies that are racing to create a vaccine. But research is costly and slow, partly because there are four virus types for dengue, each different. '"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE - When Lynne Rodgers Miller and her husband, Daniel J. Miller, saw the news of the mudslide in Washington state on Saturday, they knew immediately where the land had given way.\n\nOn Saturday, at least 24 people died on a hillside when a square-mile area in Snohomish County, an hour north of Seattle, was buried in up to 40 feet of mud after a landslide.\n\nIn 1999, the Millers wrote a report filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, warning of \"the potential for a large catastrophic failure\" on the hill.\n\n\"We've known it would happen at some point,\" said Daniel Miller, a geomorphologist who studies how landscapes form and tries to predict their changes. \"We just didn't know when.\"\n\n## An Unstable Hillside\n\nDaniel Miller also documented the hill's landslide conditions in a report written in 1997 for the Washington Department of Ecology and local Native American tribes. He knows the hill's history, having a half-dozen folders stuffed with maps, slides, models and drawings done since the 1950s. They all tell the story of an unstable hillside that has defied efforts to shore it up.\n\nThat is why he could not believe what he saw in 2006, when he returned to the hill within weeks of a landslide that plugged the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, creating a new channel that threatened homes on Steelhead Drive where Saturday's mudslide occurred. Instead of seeing homes being vacated, he saw carpenters building new ones.\n\n\"Frankly, I was shocked that the county permitted any building across from the river,\" he said.\n\n\"We've known that it's been failing,\" he said of the hill. \"It's not unknown that this hazard exists.\"\n\nDaniel Miller believes officials should have understand the danger of a massive landslide, but his view stands in contrast to what John Pennington, head of Snohomish County's Department of Emergency Management, said at a news conference Monday. \"It was considered very safe,\" Pennington said. \"This was a completely unforeseen slide. This came out of nowhere.\"\n\nAt least five homes were built in 2006 on Steelhead Drive, the year of another slide, according to Snohomish County records, and another home was built in the neighborhood in 2009.\n\n\"They didn't even stop pounding nails,\" said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer who studied the area with Miller soon after the 2006 slide. \"We were surprised.\"\n\nSnohomish County Executive John Lovick and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night that they were not aware of the 1999 report. \"A slide of this magnitude is very difficult to predict,\" Thomsen said. \"There was no indication, no indication at all.\"\n\n## 5 Landslides Since The 1940s\n\nIrvin Wood and his wife, Judith, owned the last home allowed to be built in the slide zone.\n\nThe Woods used the property as a weekend getaway. But they were not there on Saturday when the mudslide wiped out their mobile home and swept away neighbors who are now missing and presumed dead.\n\nWood said nobody was warned about the likelihood of a massive landslide, but he thought it was not realistic for people to think the government could prevent the disaster.\n\n\"That's like saying the river is going to flood,\" Wood said. \"If the hillsides were going to (slide) away, they were going to (slide) away. That's kind of what happens around here.\"\n\nThere have been at least five landslides in the area since the 1940s.\n\nA slide in 1949 was nearly 1,000 feet long and took out about 2,600 feet of the river bank, according to a report that was commissioned by the state. The scarp - the face of the cliff where the slide broke away - was 70 feet tall in places.\n\nAccording to the report, a main cause of the slides is the river eroding, or slowly washing away, the \"toe\" left behind by a previous slide. The \"toe\" supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door. Eventually, the toe would fail from too much erosion, and weight and gravity would pull the mountain down again.\n\nSaturday's monster slide left a scarp of nearly 600 feet, about nine times taller than the 1949 slide and four times taller than a slide in 1967.\n\n\"We always thought there was a possibility that a catastrophic event could come,\" said Pat Stevenson, the environmental manager of the Stillaguamish Tribe, a local Native American tribe. \"We were hoping that wouldn't happen.\"\n\n## \"They Are In Mourning\"\n\nThere were discussions over the years about whether to buy out the property owners in the area to keep anyone from living there, but nothing came of them.\n\n\"I think we did the best that we could\" given the reality \"that nobody wanted to sell their property and move,\" Drury said.\n\nStevenson said county officials who approved the homes seemed more focused on whether they were in flood areas than on the risk of a landslide.\n\nRon and Gail Thompson moved into a one-bedroom cabin on five acres on Steelhead Drive in 2003, said their daughter, Jennifer Johnson, of Arlington.\n\n\"I had conversations with the Army Corps of Engineers the last time this happened. They showed me a map and said mom and dad's house would be safe,\" she said Monday. \"When we moved them in there, I never in a million years, never in a billion years, thought about (a mudslide). Dad was like, 'We're going to be fine,' and I just believed him.\"\n\nJohnson's parents and 85-year-old grandmother left their house eight minutes before the slide hit on Saturday morning for a shopping trip to Costco, Johnson said. The couple lost everything they had.\n\n\"They are in mourning. They're in shock,\" she said. \"They're heartbroken for their neighbors.\"'"

            "text": "\tFLINT, Mich. - Ariana Hawk heated a bowl of distilled water in the microwave, dipped a washcloth in it and wiped her 2-year-old son's itchy, irritated skin.\n\nShe said she has been cleaning Sincere Smith's body this way - or with wet wipes - since last summer. The boy's doctor doesn't want him bathing in the tap water at their Flint home.\n\n\"I can't afford to go buy 20 gallons of water just to bathe him one time,\" said Hawk, a single mother of three.\n\nSincere has rough patches on his legs, arms and face, she explained. His skin condition started with a rash on his stomach after Flint switched its water supply source from Lake Huron to the more polluted Flint River in April 2014.\n\nHawk blames the water for the child's suffering and plans to sue.\n\n\"We get treated like ... we don't matter,\" she said. \"That's how it's been feeling.\"\n\n## Pets And Plants Affected Too\n\nResidents across Flint echo her frustration. Some of them stopped using the water immediately after the cost-saving change because of its smell, color, taste and source, while others continued to drink and cook with it.\n\nPeople, pets, even plants have been affected by the poisonous water, which is contaminated with lead, they said.\n\nCommunity members feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed. They are bracing for what will happen next in Flint, a city with 99,000 residents, 40 percent of whom live in poverty.\n\nThe city has seen a spike in the levels of lead in children's blood. Lead poisoning, experts say, affects intelligence and can have a lifelong impact, causing learning disabilities, speech and language problems, as well as an increased risk for behavioral problems.\n\nKids absorb lead more easily and have been exposed to lead if they drank Flint water since April 2014, health officials said.\n\n## Lead Levels Have Spiked In Children\n\nDr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician at Flint's Hurley Children's Hospital, found a dangerous spike in children's blood lead levels. She said there is a lag period between lead exposure and symptoms, which can appear three to five years down the road.\n\nTo limit the impact of lead-poisoning in children, she suggested better nutrition, health care and early education programs.\n\nPamela Battle, a Flint resident with seven children ranging in age from 1 to 16, said she got a water filter Monday. Before that, she was using water from her faucet to cook and put it in bottles for her two youngest children.\n\n\"We were drinking it regularly,\" said Battle. \"The whole family. Everyone here.\"\n\nAt the urging of her mother, Battle went to Freeman Elementary School last Tuesday with some of her kids to get their blood checked for lead. The school hosted an event where she learned about lead poisoning and its effects on children.\n\n\"I'm really concerned now,\" she said.\n\n\"I love my kids,\" Battle said. \"I want them to grow up like I grew up\" with no worries about water.\n\nShe said she has no choice but to stay in Flint with her children and live with the water crisis, but others have had enough and plan to leave.\n\n## Governor Says More, Faster Help Needed\n\nKerry Wheeler said she, her 11-year-old daughter and their dog are moving to another town to escape the water situation.\n\nWater in her home has varied from clear or cloudy to brown or yellow. At times, it has been so discolored that she refused to let her daughter bathe in it, she said.\n\nMichigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of emergency Jan. 5 and acknowledged that actions taken by the state have not been good enough. He said that \"more work needs to be done with more urgency.\"\n\nState efforts were raised this week to get free bottled water, filtering supplies and water-testing kits to Flint residents. Members of the Michigan National Guard have been sent to Flint, and Snyder requested federal help for the water crisis.\n\nOn Saturday, President Barack Obama declared a federal emergency in Flint and ordered federal aid to help.\n\n## Free Water, Filters Handed Out\n\nThroughout last week, people lined up to pick up free water and filters at fire stations. More free supplies have been passed out door-to-door by Michigan State Police troopers, volunteers and others.\n\nFlint Mayor Karen Weaver said Thursday night that the city has made progress but needs more people to help.\n\nThe city changed its source of water back to Lake Huron in October, but concerns about contamination remain because the water from the Flint River damaged pipes. Dan Wyant, the former head of the state Department of Environmental Quality, resigned last month. The agency failed to require the addition of anticorrosive chemicals to the water that would have protected the pipes.\n\n## Public Trust Is Gone\n\nSnyder has repeatedly apologized for the state's role in the water crisis, but many say he still hasn't done enough.\n\n\"That apology ain't going to help these kids,\" said Hawk, who said she doesn't know what dangers her children may face because of their exposure to lead. \"That apology's not going to help the families that's suffering.\"\n\nWeaver said that public trust has been shattered, and the solution is to fix the infrastructure and provide long-term help for Flint residents.\n\n\"We didn't deserve to be in this position, in this situation,\" she said, \"and what happened here in Flint should never happen to any community.\"'"

            "text": "\tIt's a drag to eat kale that is not as crisp as it was when first plucked from the ground. Eating squash that's a few days old is not bad, but it could be better. It could be 1 day old. Or not old.\n\nA new study, published this week by a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University, found that Americans are pretty picky about what gets to stay in their refrigerators. One of the most common excuses for tossing out food is that people \"want to eat only the freshest food.\" The other common reason is a fear of food poisoning.\n\n## Fresh Is Relative\n\nAn accompanying chart lists the most common excuses in order of popularity. Most of them have a tinge of privilege - where people feel comfortable throwing out food that is likely still edible, just because they can afford to.\n\nThis sort of fussiness over food has has become increasingly popular here in the United States. Though it can be a good thing. It has, after all, fostered a growing appreciation of fresh fruits and vegetables, which has in turn helped support smaller family farms, many of which have fallen victim to the modern day food system.\n\nBut caring too much about how green an avocado is or how many days it has been since a peach was first picked by a farmer can also be a very bad thing. Sometimes it encourages people to throw out perfectly edible things because they are not fresh enough by their new standards.\n\n## Too Much Waste\n\nThe amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has ballooned in recent years. In 2012, the nearest year for which estimates are available, Americans threw away roughly 35 million tons of food, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That is almost 20 percent more food than Americans tossed out in 2000.\n\nRoughly half of all food waste comes from families and other individuals, as opposed to businesses.\n\nThe problem is often caused by the unreasonable standards we have set for foods sold commercially. Several studies have pointed to this very inefficiency, whereby consumers mistake cautionary labels for full-stop warnings about foods.\n\nThis most recent research confirms that food poisoning is indeed on many people's minds. But it also suggests that food snobbery is not helping either. There are legitimate reasons, after all, to throw away food. \"I am too good to eat this less-than-ideal apple,\" however, is not one of them.'"

            "title": "Sink your teeth into this story: Scientists find a new taste",
            "text": "\tTaste is the sense that lets us appreciate the beauty of good food. It is something that scientists already understand fairly well. The sensation we feel when eating a piece of cake, chewing on a hamburger or taking the first bite of a piping hot piece of pizza is triggered when chemicals in our food interact with receptors in our mouths and send messages to our brains.\n\nFor hundreds of years, scientists believed there were four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Recently, a Japanese chemist discovered a fifth basic taste called umami. It is triggered by monosodium glutamate, or MSG, as it is more widely known. Umami could perhaps be best described as savory, a food that has a rich, salty flavor that is not sweet. It is especially common in truffles, brothy soups, meat and anchovies.\n\nNow scientists believe they have found a sixth basic taste that could profoundly change the way we eat.\n\n## In Touch With A New Taste\n\nIn a new study, researchers found evidence that fat actually interacts with human taste buds in a way similar to the five basic tastes. Scientists have known for some time that receptors in our mouths recognize fat. It led many scientists to believe that it could change the way we perceive and experience food, in the same way that tastes such as sweet and sour do. Now there's evidence that it does.\n\n\"Fat is likely another one of the basic tastes. I think we have pretty clear evidence for this,\" said Richard Mattes, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University, and the lead author of the study.\n\n## Fat, Glorious Fat\n\nThe findings could be great news for food lovers around the world as chefs are always looking for new ways to expand their cooking skills. Mattes said that if people learn to work with the taste of fat correctly in the kitchen, it will allow us to make lots of foods taste better by either reproducing the taste of fat or introducing substitutes that successfully mimic it.\n\n\"We could isolate it and use it in the same way we have used the other basic tastes,\" Mattes said.\n\nThere are literally thousands of taste buds on a single human tongue, not to mention on the tops, bottoms and sides of our mouths. Receptors are all over our taste buds, too - there are as many as 100 taste receptors on each taste bud. How we experience a mouthful of food depends on how the chemicals in the foods interact with the receptors on our tongues. The basic tastes blend together like primary colors to produce wildly different paintings of flavor.\n\n## The Fat-Detector Test\n\nIn order to figure out that fat could be another one of the basic tastes, Mattes conducted two experiments. In the first, more than 100 participants were given solutions that had one of six different tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami and fatty. They were then asked to sort them into as many groups as they believed were necessary. The participants had little trouble identifying sweet, sour and salty as unique tastes, but, interestingly, they put the remaining three into one general group.\n\n\"We're pretty sure that they did that because bitterness, umami-ness and fattiness, when isolated, can be pretty strange,\" Mattes said. \"So they put them in a 'This is bad' or 'This is strange' group.\"\n\nThen the researchers pressed the issue further, and that's when a clear division surfaced. In another experiment, they gave participants solutions containing only the three \"bad\" or \"strange\" tastes, and the participants easily divided the tastes into three groups.\n\n\"It was really very telling,\" Mattes said. \"We already knew that people have a taste receptor for fatty acids. Now we know that it's a distinguishable taste - that it doesn't have overlap. The combination of those two things is what is important.\"\n\n## A Singular Sensation\n\nThe fat taste that Mattes is talking about is hidden in a bite of steak or a dollop of olive oil - just as umami is hidden in a bite of anchovy. Fat is what's called a triglyceride, because it is made up of three fatty acids. The combination of the three - which are different in size and therefore different in flavor - gives fat the mouth feel and creaminess we associate with it.\n\nThe kind Mattes is talking about is actually only one of those three fatty acids: the longest. It is the one that stimulates the flavor profile that is unique to fat.\n\nAs with primary colors, a primary taste can be recognized as such only if it doesn't share characteristics with other primary tastes. The fact that people can so easily recognize fat as a unique sensation in this situation is evidence that it is a primary taste, especially since it already meets all of the other qualifications.\n\nThe impact of Mattes' research could extend well beyond the reach of his lab. It might very well end up affecting what is on your plate, and, more specifically, how it tastes.\n\n\"Understanding this could have huge implications for the food industry,\" Mattes said. \"It could make a lot of food taste a lot better.\"'"

            "text": "\tCALAIS, France - The school's floor is sandy like the nearby dunes and its roof is held up by tree branches covered in flowered cloth. Inside, the students seated at small desks are listening with soldierly attention.\n\n\"'Light' is 'lumiere,'\" said the teacher, giving a French lesson in English to migrants who have come from far corners of the globe to this vast camp in the French port city of Calais. \"A lamp gives you light.\"\n\nThe single-room schoolhouse is located on one edge of the camp known as the \"jungle,\" and the four to six classes held there every day are packed with students.\n\nThe Chemin des Dunes School opened its small door - found in a garbage can - on July 11. It was the brainchild of Zimako Jones, a Nigerian and one of an estimated 3,000 migrants who are living in dwellings of sticks and tarp. They are among waves of migrants fleeing violence and poverty and arriving on Europe's shores, crossing the internal borders of European countries and straining asylum systems across Europe. They are hoping to be allowed to stay and to be granted asylum, which is offered to people who would be endangered if they were sent back to their home countries.\n\n## Common Struggle Unites Diverse Nationalities\n\n\"It helps build bridges between the different nationalities,\" Virginie Tiberghien, one of about 20 volunteer teachers, said of the school. \"It really helps maintain a sense of humanity even if their daily lives are very difficult.\"\n\nMost of the migrants in Calais hope to sneak away through the Channel Tunnel, which connects France and Britain under the English Channel. They believe Britain offers them better prospects for jobs and prosperity. With help from the school, which offers a haven from the cruelty of daily life, some are trying to learn enough French to end their travels and apply for asylum in France instead.\n\nThe school offers French, English, painting and tai chi, a Chinese form of exercise - or whatever else the teachers might propose.\n\nBut the graffiti on the outside canvas wall of the schoolhouse perhaps best reflects what is at stake: \"Never give up hope,\" says one, while another says, \"Hey everybody. We are in school.\" The word \"ciel,\" French for \"sky,\" and a picture of a bird decorate one wall.\n\n## Learning Without Regard To Religion, Skin Color\n\nZimako dreamed up the idea for the school and built it with the help of five Sudanese, mostly out of an urge to improve the lives of people in the camp.\n\n\"I thought of doing this to help the people of the jungle, to unite them,\" he said. \"It's a school without religion, without color. We are all together, people.\"\n\nZimako also wanted to help himself. He arrived in southern France as a migrant in 2013 and moved in April to Calais, where he is seeking asylum. Fluent in French and English, he was swamped with so many requests from needy migrants to help them translate that he was tired.\n\nToday, a big chalkboard covers the front wall of the classroom, and pictures of objects from animals to airplanes are posted on walls with their French names. The classroom can squeeze in up to 35 students, who are mainly adults of different ages.\n\nTiberghien is a speech therapist teaching a French class, and Chris Jaumotte, a Belgian artist living in the area, teaches French and art.\n\n## Dignity Accompanies Each Lesson\n\n\"We give them a bit of dignity. I think their dignity is being trampled here,\" Jaumotte said, referring to the tarp shelters where those in the camp take shelter. The artist gives the students an A for their concentrated effort.\n\n\"This is a jungle,\" said 26-year-old Ahmed Riaz of Pakistan, who hopes the school will help him find his way out of the camp. He ended up sitting in the schoolhouse literally by accident - after breaking a leg when he tried to catch a ride to Britain through the Channel Tunnel. Riaz, who is seeking political asylum in France, has attended French class at the school since it opened.\n\n## Aid Groups Help Provide Classroom Staples\n\nHumanitarian associations have helped contribute supplies such as notebooks and pens. Jaumotte bought the paints, brushes and small pots for each desk in the art class.\n\nAt one desk, a young African had painted a boat at sea, full of people, much like the boatloads of migrants who make the perilous passage across the Mediterranean, as many in the camp have done. He titled the picture in red \"Dangerous Days.\"\n\nZimako is humble about his accomplishment, and he keeps thinking big: He wants to build a second, larger school.\n\n\"It's ideas at work,\" he said. \"It's not me.\"'"

            "text": "\tFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Lynda Walsh wants kids to look fashionable no matter how tight their budget is.\n\nTo provide young people with clothing of all sizes and accessories to match, Walsh recently opened the Cool Clothes Closet of South Palm Beach County. Kids can shop at the nonprofit boutique without worrying about how much money is in their wallet.\n\nThe 69-year-old retiree's main goal is to provide both everyday and professional clothing - at no cost. Her boutique provides clothes to children in foster care, older kids looking for their first jobs and children of returning veterans who have not found work yet, she said.\n\n\"We are here to give clothes away to kids who need them,\" said Walsh, a court-appointed advocate for children from Delray Beach, Florida. An advocate watches out for the rights and interests of kids in the foster care system. Children who cannot live with their families or who do not have families are placed by the state with foster parents until they can find permanent homes.\n\n## Replacing Dirty, Ragged Clothes\n\nEven though the clothes are free, Cool Clothes Closet is set up like a fancy store. There are clothes hanging on racks and folded in dressers for both males and females in sizes extra small to triple extra large.\n\nWalsh's effort started in 2012, when she became a legal guardian for children in the foster care system.\n\nWalsh isn't a stranger to working with kids in rough situations. Before she moved to Florida in 2000, she worked in Chicago as a court reporter in the juvenile court system.\n\nOnce she started helping at the West Palm Beach Courthouse, she saw how shabbily dressed the kids were when they showed up to court.\n\n\"I saw teens coming to court in dirty, ragged clothes,\" she said.\n\nEven though the courthouse has a closet of clothes for kids to change into when they appear in court, she said she wanted to help kids outside of the court.\n\n## Don't Forget Accessories\n\nTo open the Cool Clothes Closet, Walsh said she asked friends and family to donate clothes and help organize the space. She said her 93-year-old mother helps wash and iron donated clothes.\n\nSince no outfit would be complete without the right accessories, there are also shoes, purses and hats for the taking.\n\nThe Clothes Closet opened its doors about four months ago, drawing its young customers through word-of-mouth recommendations. The handful of children who have been assisted so far have been grateful, Walsh said.\n\n\"Everybody has found something,\" she said. \"Nobody has gone empty-handed.\"\n\nRoberta Mizrahi, who volunteers at the boutique, said the kids are often shy about trying on the clothes. They perk up with excitement when they try on something they like.\n\n\"I think it's wonderful,\" she said.\n\nThere is no limit on how little or how much kids can take, but Walsh said the average is about two shopping bags per person. To get the full boutique experience, Walsh had custom shopping bags made.\n\n\"I didn't want people walking out of here with Publix bags,\" she said, referring to the grocery-store chain.\n\n## Getting The Word Out\n\nNow her focus is on finding shoppers and working around their schedules. The shop isn't open during regular business hours, since that is when kids are in school. Instead, Walsh schedules one-on-one appointments on weekends or after school.\n\nWalsh said she has a special place in her heart for the older kids, who are gearing up to start new chapters of their lives as adults. She makes sure the Closet is stocked with professional clothing available for job interviews.\n\n\"I can remember being their age,\" she said.\n\nTo let people know the boutique is open, she spends time reaching out to local schools, churches and after-school care programs.\n\n\"We need to connect with children and let them know we are here,\" she said.'"

            "title": "Expanded lunch program helps more schools",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - This fall, a free lunch could be coming to thousands more students around the country, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.\n\nThe expansion comes through the Community Eligibility Provision, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. It was part of a [broader school nutrition measure](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) that opened the door for districts with free or reduced-price lunches to offer the meals to every student at the school. There is no cost to them - no application necessary and regardless of household income.\n\nThe program has seen a slow state-by-state rollout since 2010. Certain schools in three states (Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan) were eligible first, based on need and their data-sharing capabilities. Last year, 4,000 more schools in 11 states participated. But all states will be covered starting this school year. Now the question facing district officials in newly eligible states is whether it makes financial - and political - sense to participate.\n\n## Districts Are Giving It Some Thought\n\nOriginally, districts had until the end of June to decide. The federal government extended the deadline into August to give districts more time, especially after some delays in publishing the list of schools or districts eligible.\n\nThere's no real-time tracking of how many new districts will participate this year, but state and local education officials are weighing it. In most states, hundreds of schools are eligible, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn areas where the program has been implemented, it's been lauded by state and district officials, teachers and child nutrition advocates. They say it is a boon for the low-income school lunch program, which provided 21.5 million free or reduced-price meals in schools last year. That's more than 70 percent of all meals served through the National School Lunch Program.\n\n\"Everyone's got a great meal that they can get at no charge. It just becomes the standard; it really unites the campus,\" said Madeleine Levin of the Food Research and Action Center. \"We're wrapping our arms around these (schools) that need support just like we do in other educational programs.\"\n\n## Many Financial Considerations\n\nUnder the [community eligibility provision](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch), the federal government pays for only a share of the expansion, leaving states to pay the balance. As a result, not all school districts are expected to participate.\n\nSchools where 40 percent or more of the students automatically qualify for the school lunch program are eligible to use community eligibility. There are more than 28,000 such schools nationwide.\n\nIn schools where nearly all students are already receiving a free lunch, there will be little change in federal funding. That's because the school is already being reimbursed for nearly all lunches served at the higher free-lunch federal rate. That can top $3 per meal, rather than the lower rate, which can be well below $1 per lunch.\n\nBut if eligibility is closer to the 40 percent threshold, the school will have to make up the difference for a portion of the meals.\n\nIn Fort Wayne, Indiana, for example, officials will offer the expanded lunch program at all elementary and middle schools starting this fall. But high schools there will have to wail. Lunch program participation at the high school level tends to be lower, and officials weren't sure including them would make financial sense.\n\nThe district had some elementary and middle schools that already had 95 percent or more of their students covered by the free-lunch program, said Krista Stockman, a spokeswoman for the district. At that point, \"It really becomes easier to give everyone the free meals,\" she said.\n\n\"It starts to become more of a hassle to have to deal with some students who are paying,\" she added. \"Overall, it just makes a much smoother process for our schools, our students and for our families.\"\n\n## Slow And Steady Participation\n\nHigh schools have always been more difficult when it comes to the free and reduced-price lunch program. There's more shame about participating, officials and experts say. In some cases, families' financial situations might improve as children grow and parents are freer to work, without paying the high cost of child care. That can reduce the number of students eligible for the program.\n\nApart from the high school question, though, other districts have taken a timid approach. Indiana's East Allen County Schools chose not to participate. Officials wanted to wait and see the effects in neighboring districts, district spokeswoman Tamyra Kelly said.\n\nIn Chicago, officials have moved slowly: They started with 215 schools, expanded to 465, and will cover all 658 schools starting next school year.\n\nLeslie Fowler is the executive director of nutrition support services for Chicago schools. She said that to make the new program work, they had to be sure enough students would qualify under existing rules. They reached their set level of enrollment under older free lunch rules, 62.5 percent of all students in the district. This made sure the difference in payment rates from Washington didn't cost the district revenue.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense to do district-wide if you don't get to that threshold because at that point you're probably losing revenue,\" she said.\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota, is another district that is moving slowly. Jean Ronnei, the chief operations officer, said the district is doing a \"test drive,\" implementing the program at one high school, one middle school and a few elementary schools.\n\n\"Not going full swoop will give us a chance to see more about what the impact will be,\" she said. She said that there are some unrelated funds, like per-student aid from the state based on free-lunch enrollment levels, that are tied to paperwork. Without it, the funds could be more difficult to collect if no application is necessary for the free lunch program.'"

            "text": "\tAccording to a new report, young women are now very close to achieving workplace equality with men - at least when it comes to wages. But what remains to be seen is whether motherhood will slow their progress. It did for women before them.\n\nThe report was issued by the Pew Research Center. As of last year, Pew found that women workers ages 25 to 34 were making 93 percent of what men of the same ages earned. This was much closer to wage equality than what was typical of earlier generations.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2012, the gap has gradually narrowed for American workers. Wages have risen for women and dropped for young men.\n\nOnly 15 percent of young women said they had suffered workplace discrimination because of their gender (that is, their sex). Female millennials - young women ages 18 to 32 - are now as likely as men to have asked their bosses for a promotion or a raise. This was not true for generations of women before them.\n\n## Still A Slippery Slope With Wages\n\nYet most young women - 75 percent - believe that more change is needed before men and women are equal at work, the Pew survey showed. Almost 3 out of 5 say that it is easier for men to get top jobs in business and government. Nearly two-thirds fear that having children will hold them back in the workplace.\n\n\"I don't think I've been held back because of my gender,\" said 25-year-old graphic designer Alexandria Manson. But in all kinds of other fields, \"I can definitely see there are way more executive men than there are women - and not because of their ability.\"\n\nMillennials have reason to worry: Earlier generations of young women seemed to be narrowing the gender gap in wages, only to slip as they aged and many started juggling motherhood with jobs.\n\nIn 1995, for instance, women hitting their late 20s and early 30s earned 85 percent as much as their male counterparts, according to a Pew analysis of U.S. government data. By 2012, those same women were now in their 40s and 50s. And they were only making 76 percent as much as men of their same age.\n\n\"The question mark is, what will happen to millennials 10 or 15 years into their career?\" said Kim Parker, Pew's director of social trends research. \"Will they slide behind?\"\n\n## A Parenthood Penalty?\n\nAmong Americans of all ages, mothers were almost three times as likely as fathers to have quit their jobs at some point to care for a child or other family member, the Pew survey found. Mothers were also more likely to reduce their hours or take time off for family.\n\n\"Nowadays, a childless woman may be able to work every bit as much as her male counterpart,\" sociology professor Barbara Risman said. \"What's holding people back is when they become parents.\" This is true not only for mothers, she said, but also for fathers \"who take equal or primary responsibility for raising children.\"\n\nAmong working parents with children younger than 18, mothers were roughly three times as likely as fathers - 51 percent versus 16 percent - to say parenthood had hampered their careers. Even among millennial parents, mothers were much more likely than fathers to say that working parents have trouble advancing.\n\nWhen Kylie Anderson worked a string of internships and jobs in the entertainment business, dreaming of writing scripts for movies, she noticed other women struggling to balance work and children. None seemed to breeze through it, said Anderson.\n\nWhen it comes to her own career, the 22-year-old concluded, \"having a child would be game over, at least for a while.\"\n\nEven among millennials, women are still less likely than men to aspire to becoming the boss. Pew found that gap persists despite the fact that most millennial women are as focused on their careers as men, if not more so.\n\n\"I get frustrated with my friends because they don't aspire,\" said Jordan Boldt, a 30-year-old mother who decided to stay home with her daughters. \"It's like we grow up thinking that we can't go far.\"'"

            "title": "Harsh parenting can have ill effects on a child's mind",
            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA -Mothers and father everywhere are capable of grabbing their child's arm too roughly or speaking too harshly.\n\nThis goes for rich parents, as well as poor ones. But low-income parents, who struggle with overwhelming stress from hunger or joblessness or poor housing, treat their children harshly more often, researchers say.\n\nAnd their children suffer from it in ways science is just beginning to understand.\n\nAlthough not legally defined as child abuse, harsh or authoritarian parenting causes toxic stress in children, researchers say. It can change the structure of their brains and the way their brains function. It also increases the chances of bad behavior, and may lead to heart disease and other health problems.\n\n## Damages Brain Development\n\n\"This is an incredibly important public health issue,\" said Joan Luby, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. After studying 145 children over 12 years, she wrote an article about the effect of poverty on children's brains in the journal JAMA Pediatrics in October.\n\nThink of harsh parenting as being as destructive as lead poisoning, said Daniel Taylor, a pediatrician at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia.\n\nThis kind of parenting often involves \"quick 'do-as-I-say' orders from Mom or Dad,\" Taylor said. Without the buffering effect of a loving, supportive attitude by their parents, it causes the release in children of stress hormones such as cortisol. Stress hormones are released when the body perceives it is in danger, and these hormones can be toxic to developing brains.\n\nThey can cause damage to a child's amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. The child may become hyperactive, get into fights, have a short attention span, and cannot calm down, Taylor said.\n\nToxic stress also may damage the hippocampus, a part of the brain that affects memory, he said. So these children may have trouble remembering things, which reduces their ability to read and do well on tests.\n\nIf toxic hormones are released constantly, children will suffer elevated blood pressure, sugar levels and heart rate. This puts them at high risk for developing heart disease, said social worker Marcy Witherspoon, an expert on child welfare and brain development.\n\nHarsh parenting crosses the boundaries of race and income. But Taylor and others believe that poor neighborhoods likely hold countless generations of families suffering from damaged brain development.\n\n\"If a child's developing brain was being damaged by high lead levels, landlords would be sued, houses repaired,\" Taylor said. \"If a child's brain was being damaged by mercury in the water, the system would be changed.\"\n\nBut, he asked, \"Who is going to pay, who is responsible for ensuring our children are not affected by the toxin of child poverty in America?\"\n\n## \"I Control Myself\"\n\nDave, who grew up in a poor family, participated in a recent parenting workshop run by Witherspoon. He said he suffered from toxic stress during his childhood during which, he said, \"my over-disciplining, yelling, cursing mother ripped me apart.\"\n\nHe's now a single father who lives in Philadelphia with his two young children.\n\n\"My mother would always tell me I'd never amount to anything,\" Dave said. \"I was depressed.\"\n\nHe is fearful that he'd pass along toxic stress to his children. \"There are only two ways you come out of a situation like mine,\" Dave said. \"You're either a victim and let the bad experiences control you, or you become better in spite of it.\"\n\nDave believes that, in part by writing poetry and by drawing, he made peace with his upbringing and prevented passing down toxic stress to his kids.\n\nDave said he is proud that even if he is angry with his children, he doesn't embarrass them.\n\n\"I don't say they're bad, only that they're doing something bad. I control myself,\" Dave said.\n\nNot all poor children suffer from toxic stress.\n\nSome parents do a good job of protecting their children's brains by being engaged and attentive, said Maria McColgan, medical director of the Child Protection Program at St. Christopher's.\n\nOn the other hand, middle-class people are quite capable of delivering toxic stress to their children, a 1998 California study showed.\n\nMore recently, a Philadelphia study showed that more than 33 percent of Philadelphia adults experienced emotional abuse during childhood. But high levels of abuse go along with high poverty.\n\n## Stopping The Cycle\n\nParents don't have to be harsh to do damage. A poor mother distracted by lack of food can become incapable of connecting with her children. This emotional neglect can also cause toxic stress, said Bruce McEwen, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University in New York.\n\nFor good mental health, parents and children need to engage in \"serve and return\" mode, meaning that a child says something or makes a sound and a parent always responds, like serving and returning a tennis ball. Doing this supports development of language and emotions, McEwen said.\n\nBut, he added, if a parent stops responding, \"it's a form of emotional abuse.\"\n\nDespite the pain of toxic stress, there is some good news: \"You can heal from it,\" said Witherspoon, the expert on brain development.\n\n\"As long as one adult in a child's life has his back, believes in him, creates hope for the future, that's a positive,\" she said.\n\nIn Witherspoon's parenting classes, parents are taught to stop and give their children attention for the things they do correctly, she said.\n\nThey're made to recognize that they create toxic stress in their children because they themselves were victims of it. This knowledge helps them stop treating their children the way their parents treated them, and stop the cycle.\n\nParents need advocacy, empathy and support to stop taking their stresses out on their kids, Witherspoon said.\n\n\"To help,\" he said, \"I say to parents, 'Life sounds really hard. Tell me about it.'\"'"

            "text": "\tPAHOA, Hawaii - Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, is on the move, slowly but surely. As she travels, she is depositing lava across the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nSince June, lava from a vent at Kilauea volcano has been sliding northeast toward the ocean. People in the small town lying in its path say the lava will reshape the community yard by yard.\n\nA retired woman name Jamila Dandini said Pele is \"so gentle, but so unrelenting - she is just slow and steady.\" Dandini had stopped at a coffee shop down the road from where scientists have forecast the lava will likely cross.\n\nLast month, scientists said the lava flow was two weeks away from hitting the main road in Pahoa, a small town in the Puna region with about 950 residents. The lava slowed but has largely remained on course.\n\n## \"It's Like Slow Torture\"\n\nLate Wednesday, it was about 225 yards away from Pahoa Village Road, which goes through the commercial center of the Big Island's rural, mostly agricultural Puna district. It was traveling about 5 to 10 yards an hour.\n\nThe slow pace has given residents time to pack their valuables and get out of the way. However, it's been agonizing for those wondering whether the lava might change direction and head for them. It's been stressful as well for those trying to figure out how they will cope once the lava blocks the town's only roads.\n\n\"It's like slow torture - it speeds up, it slows down. It speeds up, it slows down,\" said Paul Utes, who owns the Black Rock Cafe. \"It's not like any other event where it comes and goes and it gets over with and you can move on.\"\n\nUtes' restaurant is not in the predicted path, though it's just a few hundred yards south of where the lava will likely cross the main road.\n\nHowever, he worries this could change. Even if the cafe is spared, he doesn't know how traffic will be diverted once the flow crosses the road, how supplies will reach his restaurant and what his customers will do.\n\n## No More Bus Stop\n\nFor the time being, business is up because more locals and tourists have been streaming into town hoping to get a glimpse of the molten rock.\n\n\"The anxiety building up is kind of hard to deal with,\" Utes said.\n\nThe lava has already brought changes that are beginning to have an effect on daily life in Pahoa.\n\nThe county bus no longer passes through the main street lined with wood buildings dating to the town's heyday as a lumber- and sugar-plantation town. So Dandini has to walk into town from where the bus drops her off on the outskirts.\n\nOnce the lava crosses the main road and the bypass road it will effectively slice Pahoa in half. Most residents won't be able to get to the area's only supermarket, though it's just a mile from the town center.\n\nPuna will be cut off even more if the lava makes it all the way to the ocean, some 6 miles away.\n\n## \"An Island On An Island\"\n\nSome businesses are closing or moving, while others are vowing to stay.\n\nDandini likened the coming isolation to being on \"an island on an island.\"\n\nShe predicted it would be an opportunity for people to work together to solve their problems. Some residents, she said, have been discussing pooling their resources for supply runs to Hilo, the nearest city, because it could take hours to get there once Pahoa's main roads are cut off.\n\nSo far, lava has burned a garden shed, tires and some metal materials.\n\nDozens of homes, business and other structures are near the lava, and that number could increase as the flow front widens.\n\nErbin Gamurot, 48, a handyman, said Pele just wants to visit her sister, Namakaokahai, the sea goddess.\n\n\"She's doing what she gotta do - that's her way, that's her nature. Who can stop her?\" he asked.'"

            "title": "\"We've taken the hysteria out of head lice,\" a school principal says",
            "text": "\tLOVELOCK, Nev. - For years, checking for lice eggs was part of school nurse Deborah Pontius' job description. On some days in this isolated central Nevada town, she'd actually sift through the hair of students found with live head lice.\n\nBut something bigger bugged her: the district's policy of sending children home when they were infested with head lice - grayish-white insects that suck blood from the scalp and cause severe itching.\n\nPontius saw students with head lice miss weeks of school. A re-entry ticket involved painstaking inspections, with parents required to prove that not a single hitchhiker resided on a child's head. Aside from the \"ick\" factor, she wondered, was there a reason to seclude the youngsters?\n\nAs chief nurse for the Pershing County School District's 600 students, Pontius consulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics. She interviewed families of lice-infested students.\n\n## Letting Students Stay In School\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, it turned out students did not contract the bugs in the classroom. Furthermore, the stubby-legged louse does not fly or jump, and needs close bodily contact to spread. So it seemed reasonable that students under care for the infestation could remain in class without risk to others.\n\nPontius persuaded the district to change its policy. A growing number of school districts have followed suit.\n\nWith Pontius co-writing the new policy paper, the National Association of School Nurses changed its recommendations to allow students with head lice - known as pediculosis - to stay in class. But Pontius, 55, knows the battle isn't over.\n\nParents complain that school officials' failure to issue warning letters when a student is found with head lice leaves them without tools to fight infestation. One New Jersey district has signaled it may reintroduce the lice ban due to objections by school board members. And the National Pediculosis Association (NPA) objects to the changes: It has warned that easing school restrictions could harm efforts to halt the spread of head lice.\n\nThe NPA has voiced its opposition to the new Los Angeles Unified School District policy that permits children to attend school even if they show signs of lice eggs, or nits. \"L.A. County and other communities are trading in their nit-free standard for children in the classroom in favor of chasing lice with pesticides.\"\n\nIt's unclear how many districts nationwide have opted for less-restrictive lice policies, but Nevada offers a hint: Of 14 counties with chief school district nurses, four have eased their rules on head lice since 2011. Others are cautiously considering the move.\n\n## A Contentious Issue\n\n\"We know people will overreact,\" said Sheila Story, chief nurse for the Carson City School District. \"Head lice just gets everyone overexcited.\"\n\nEven in Lovelock, the new rules have caused tension among parents, teachers and the school board.\n\n\"This is one of the most contentious issues school boards nationwide have to deal with,\" Pontius said. \"The best I can hope is that people accept that this condition isn't worth taking a child from school. What people really want is for the lice to go away, and that's not going to happen.\"\n\nThe CDC estimates that 6 million to 12 million U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 11 are infested each year by lice. The bugs crawl among children during sustained contact at sleepovers, play groups and other such activities. The wingless insects live their entire lives on human scalps, feeding on blood and attaching their eggs to hair follicles. Fortunately, they do not carry disease.\n\nCDC officials support the policies of the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose 2010 report said, \"No healthy child should be excluded from or allowed to miss school time because of head lice.\"\n\nUnder Lovelock's guidelines, Pontius calls the parents of students with lice and recommends chemical treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. She does not send a general notification letter to other parents for fear of causing panic.\n\n## \"Nit-Pickers\" And \"Lice Ladies\"\n\nPontius also gives out a fact sheet she calls \"Lice 101: Everything You Really Didn't Want to Know About Lice.\" She and other National Nursing Association board members who worked on the group's new policy jokingly called themselves \"nit-pickers\" and \"lice ladies\" to take the edge off what they say is an overblown health scare.\n\nBut Pontius hasn't been able to banish the idea that head lice are a sign of bad parenting. \"With even the mention of head lice, people itch - they scratch their heads,\" she said. \"Many mistakenly see the bugs as signs of a dirty home.\"\n\nShea Murphy, principal at Lovelock Elementary School, at first opposed Pontius' plan, but has changed her mind. \"We've taken the hysteria out of head lice,\" she said.\n\nPockets of resistance remain, however. Lovelock teacher Dana Montes calls lice a classroom nightmare. \"One girl, all she did was sit there picking out the lice and putting them on the desk.\" She believes the bugs move among hats and coats on racks or among students working in close quarters.\n\nThat's how she got a case of head lice from a student six years ago: \"I leaned over her at the reading table and saw lice in her hair. Then one dropped onto the desk. By then it was too late.\"\n\nThe bugs are gone, but not forgotten. \"When I die and go to heaven,\" Montes said, \"the first question I'm going to ask God is: 'Why did you create lice? What was that all about?'\"'"

            "text": "\t### PRO: Fight efforts to water them down\n\nWASHINGTON - As a new school year begins, American parents should enthusiastically join first lady Michelle Obama's campaign for healthier school lunches. Her drive is based on sound nutritional science with the goal of healthier, happier kids.\n\nThe first lady has made improving childhood health through better eating and more exercise her signature issue.\n\nThat's a wise choice, since childhood obesity reached epidemic proportions: In 2012, 1 in 3 American children were overweight or obese. Overweight children are at higher risk of developing a variety of ailments, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes that diminish their lives and cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year.\n\nOne part of Obama's overall program is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. It's an update to the national school lunch program, which has helped pay for school meals since 1946. More than 30 million students now participate, but the program hadn't had a major overhaul in 15 years.\n\n## Making School Meals Healthier\n\nFollowing recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, school meals are now supposed to contain fewer calories, less fat and salt, and more fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Most parents would agree these are admirable goals.\n\nLess noticed than the menu changes are other parts of the new law that improve access to school meals for low-income and foster kids.\n\nIt's important to note that the federal government only sets guidelines - local school systems create their own menus. And contrary to ridiculous rumors, nothing in the law prohibits bake sales or birthday cakes in the classroom.\n\nStill, as should be expected when making big changes to a national program, there have been glitches. For instance, it turned out many high school athletes needed more protein than the guidelines allowed. The government responded by amending the regulations.\n\nThe vast majority of school systems are working with Washington to implement the changes - more than 90 percent are going along with the new guidelines. Studies show most kids have grown to like the new, healthier options.\n\nBut, just as with health care reform, there are those who, because of their beliefs or politics, prefer attacking the law to improving it. There have been efforts in Congress to waive the new nutritional standards for a year. Some nutrition advocates see the influence of junk-food sellers in the legislative efforts to stall or roll back the new standards.\n\n## Getting Kids To Go Along\n\nIt should be no surprise to any parent that kids resist healthy food. But, just as is true around the family dining room table, with sufficient time and encouragement, children can be persuaded to try new foods. Eventually, they come to enjoy them. School systems that phased the changes in slowly found greater student acceptance.\n\nOrganizations that work most intensively to promote good nutrition, such as the Food Research and Action Center, wholeheartedly support the new meal standards and are fighting efforts to water them down.\n\nA congressional study from earlier this year found that the new standards were achieving the goal of better nutrition for kids. It blamed the problems of implementation on the speed and size of the changes.\n\nThe federal government has been contributing food and money to our schools to improve student nutrition for decades. Such aid is good for the kids, good for education and good for our country. Over the years, assistance has been extended to cover breakfast as well as lunch - and improved, such as in the mid-90s, the last time school meals were updated.\n\nObama's campaign is just the latest effort to make sure our kids eat right at school. It deserves every parent's support.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: William Rice is a policy specialist with Americans for Democratic Action (www.adaction.org), the nation's oldest liberal advocacy organization.

McClatchy-Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of McClatchy-Tribune or Newsela.\n\n### CON: They aren't fit for public consumption\n\nWASHINGTON - The main focus of the national school meal programs should be meeting students' needs. But for that to happen, there must be recognition that parents - not the first lady or Congress - know what's best for their children.\n\nUnfortunately, the school meal standards that started to go into effect two years ago under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 ignore parents. Instead, the standards favor a federal government that thinks it knows everything.\n\nThose who dare to speak against these standards have quickly felt the wrath of Michelle Obama and her fans in the administration.\n\nIt's not just policymakers who have felt the anger of the first lady. The School Nutrition Association, representing more than 55,000 school nutrition experts, sent a letter to the first lady expressing \"disappointment regarding your July 22nd comments disparaging school nutrition professionals.\"\n\n## Program Has Excessive Restrictions\n\nThe new meal standards try to control every aspect of what's served to children. They place severe restrictions on calories, nutritional content and portion sizes. Some schools have left the program, willing to sacrifice the massive amounts of money it offers in exchange for freedom from its excessive restrictions.\n\nThe assumption underlying these new standards is that the federal government must control nutritional policy in the schools. Our government seems to believe parents can't be trusted to teach their children how to make dietary choices that meet their unique needs.\n\nProponents claim that parents need help because they can't ensure their kids are eating properly at school. Of course, parents can't know every single thing that their children eat at school, but this doesn't mean parents haven't provided their children with the necessary knowledge to make informed choices. But even assuming that schools need to limit food choices, this doesn't justify federal control.\n\nParents concerned about the food provided to their children at school are much better off going to local officials to address these issues. They will generally get the chance to meet with the officials and have their voices heard.\n\nParents aren't going to get very far trying to convince D.C. politicians about their specific concerns. Local officials who would like to help have their hands tied with these new standards because they don't have the necessary flexibility to address many concerns.\n\nIf the new standards provided greater flexibility to states and local authorities, it would help officials better meet the needs of their students. Not only that, but it would also empower parents by giving them a greater say in the food provided through meal programs.\n\n## Government Ignores Complaints\n\nThe federal standards have encountered a lot of criticism from nutrition officials as well as students. The independent Government Accountability Office surveyed state nutrition officials. It found that local school food authorities had a slew of real-world concerns about the lunch standards, ranging from \"increased plate waste\" - bureaucrat speak for uneaten food - to the costs of meeting the new federal dietary code.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association has echoed these concerns. The National School Board Association cautioned, \"School boards cannot ignore the higher costs and operational issues created by the rigid mandates of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.\" The mandates are so excessive that some schools have reportedly raided their teaching budgets to cover the extra costs.\n\nWorse, students are disgusted by the food provided to them. According to the GAO report, students in one district held a three-week boycott, refusing to eat school lunches. Students are posting their anger over the program using Twitter at \"#ThanksMichelle.\"\n\nThe first lady and other proponents of the standards have turned a deaf ear to the complaints. They've even opposed giving some financially struggling schools a one-year reprieve from complying with the standards. Nothing, it seems, not even the mounting evidence of the program's failure, will be allowed to slow its implementation.\n\nAnd that's a shame. Washington always hungers for power, but these federal meal standards aren't fit for public consumption. They need to be scrapped.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Daren Bakst is a research fellow in agricultural policy at The Heritage Foundation, (heritage.org), a conservative think tank on Capitol Hill.

            "title": "Helping homeless college students ",
            "text": "\tATLANTA - College student Javon Butts had his routine worked out pretty well.\n\nMost days, it went like this: Start classes at 8 a.m., finish up around noon, then head off to work. His recent life as a student at Kennesaw State University (KSU) was far from perfect, but it was temporarily manageable.\n\nAnd then his car's transmission failed.\n\nThe vehicle that left him stranded wasn't just his transportation - it was his home as well.\n\nHe's not alone, says Marcy Stidum, coordinator of KSU's CARE center, which helps homeless students. Most every college in the nation has students like Butts. They attend classes each day, work on assignments and blend in. But when other students retreat to dorm rooms or apartments for the night, they turn to their cars, campus buildings and the couches or floors of friends.\n\n## \"Living In Their Car\"\n\nTo tackle the problem, Georgia state officials are creating an outreach program to help homeless students at each of the state's public campuses. For now, though, KSU is the only Georgia college with a staff person dedicated to helping such students.\n\n\"People say these students aren't homeless, they are in college,\" said Stidum. \"Grants and loans pay for tuition, but it's the other things like housing that they can't afford. They are not the stereotypical homeless. These are students with clothes on their backs, with an iPad, living in their car, and starving.\"\n\nStidum came to KSU to work in the school's mental health program, but a year into that job she received a call about a homeless student. After helping almost a dozen homeless students that semester, she realized it was a serious problem. Since fall 2011, KSU's CARE center has helped 61 homeless students, including Butts.\n\nA sophomore finance major from Gainesville, Butts came to KSU in August 2012 after transferring from a South Carolina college. A bad experience there and a strained relationship with his family left him looking for a fresh start.\n\nAt first Butts, 20, settled comfortably into college life, playing paintball in his spare time and living in a university dorm. In fall 2013, he was using his student loan money to pay his monthly student housing bill.\n\nBut before he paid the third month's rent, his mother and sister needed help paying their bills, so Butts gave them his rent money. Unable to get the money back, he got further and further behind on his financial obligations and was eventually evicted.\n\n\"I wanted to look out for them,\" he said. \"But in reality you have to look out for yourself.\"\n\n## Finding Housing\n\nDuring the 2012-2013 academic year, more than 58,150 college students nationwide identified themselves as homeless on forms they fill out to get loans and scholarships from the government. That was an increase from the previous year's 53,705, according to information obtained by the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY).\n\nMoreover, the more recent figure is likely understated. Some students living on friends' couches, for example, don't consider themselves homeless, and some others are too embarrassed to identify themselves that way, said Barbara Duffield, NAEHCY's executive director.\n\nLast year NAEHCY received 260 requests for assistance, and calls from Georgia outnumbered all other states.\n\n\"That lets me know that the state (department of education) is working with NAEHCY and letting kids know about this,\" said Cyekeia Lee, NAEHCY's national higher-education coordinator for homeless youth. \"But it also lets me know that gaps still exist for these students.\"\n\nUnder Georgia's new program, each college would have staff like KSU's Stidum, assigned to identify and provide support for homeless students.\n\nThese days Butts, who wants to be a financial analyst, keeps pretty much to himself. The less other students know about his situation, the better. He has a hotel room but can't afford it for long. With Stidum's help, he is looking for a cheaper off-campus apartment until he has saved up enough from his job and student loan to move on campus in the fall.\n\n## Working Out A Budget\n\nWhat Georgia has begun to do is similar to approaches in other states where campus coaches help guide homeless students through the college process, but also teach life skills like paying bills. Nationally, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is pushing a bill designed to help homeless students. If passed, it will make getting loans and scholarships less complicated, reduce paperwork and establish contacts at each college to help students along the way.\n\nThat type of help is benefiting students like Samuel Robinson, 38, who has been homeless for more than a year.\n\nHe didn't start out that way. After graduating from high school in the bottom of his class, Robinson worked low-paying, unskilled jobs for a while before getting a degree in general studies and business. He left small-town Georgia for better opportunities in the Atlanta area, but again found only low-paying employment. He enrolled at KSU in 2010, and was slowly working his way through school when he lost his job two years later.\n\nStidum is helping Robinson work out a budget to pay off outstanding college fees in time to re-enroll for the summer semester. He is still living with friends, but he now has a job to pay for his living expenses there.\n\nLike Butts, Robinson never told his family about his struggle.\n\n\"I don't want pity,\" he said. \"It's embarrassing to be an adult and be homeless.\"'"

            "text": "\tFORT MILL, South Carolina - How hot is Ed Currie's world-record-holding chili pepper?\n\nIt's so hot that when you walk into the chili sorting room at his company, your eyes burn and your throat tightens from the sizzling fumes of hundreds of peppers.\n\nIt's so hot that workers who peel the chilies and scrape out seeds must wear two pairs of gloves because the chili oils can tear through one pair in just 15 minutes.\n\nThe pepper - Smokin' Ed's Carolina Reaper - is the world's hottest chili pepper, according to Guinness World Records.\n\n## How Hot Is It? Don't Ask\n\nThe Carolina Reaper rates a searing 1.56 million Scoville heat units (SHUs), hotter than the previous record holder - the Trinidad Scorpion Butch T from Australia, at 1.46 million SHUs. A very hot jalapeno might reach 10,000 SHUs.\n\nChili heat rankings may seem trivial, but they are a burning issue for people who sell hot sauce, salsa and other spicy things.\n\nAfter Guinness named the Reaper the world's hottest pepper one year ago, sales at PuckerButt, Currie's company, soared. Sales are eight times higher than they were last year, Currie said.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary, Currie recently munched on a plump Carolina Reaper, one of eight to 10 \"weapon-quality\" peppers he said he eats whole every day.\n\n\"Agh ... I'm ... losing ... the ... ability ... to ... talk,\" Currie said, gasping.\n\nHis throat was on fire. His face was blood red. His eyes watered. He choked down the rest of the Reaper and gulped down cold carbonated water. \"Eating them whole like that is just stupid,\" he said.\n\nAfter several minutes of gasping, choking and stomach cramps, Currie reported that \"it still hurts.\"\n\n## Salsa, Hot Sauce, Chili Seeds\n\nCurrie, 51, first became fascinated with crossbreeding plants when he was a boy in Michigan. He read library books about plants and read horticulture magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.\n\nHe began crossbreeding peppers after reading scientific papers suggesting that their chemical compounds might reduce the risk of heart attacks and cancer, two diseases that run in his family, Currie said.\n\n\"I wanted to find out how not to die,\" he said. \"I wanted to keep on partying.\"\n\nIn 2001, Currie moved to South Carolina and began working at a bank. At home, he made salsas and hot sauces from peppers he grew in his yard.\n\nThe peppers helped him woo and wed his wife, who loves salsa. She helped convince him later to sell his salsas rather than giving them away to friends and neighbors.\n\nCurrie opened a small booth at a flea market. Two years ago, he opened a storefront location on Main Street in downtown Fort Mill. He quit his bank job to dedicate himself full-time to his company.\n\nToday, the 8-year-old company sells salsa, hot sauce, chili seeds, chili jellies, chocolates, peanut brittle and brownies to customers worldwide.\n\n## Scaling The Pepper Peak\n\nIt took Currie 12 years of crossbreeding to reach the peak of the pepper world. He said he tested hundreds of hybrid combinations before finally finding the perfect combination. In the end, he combined a \"really nastily hot\" La Soufriere pepper from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and a Naga pepper from Pakistan to create Smokin' Ed's Carolina Reaper - called \"a tidal wave of scorching fire\" on the company's website.\n\nIn his fourth year of the breeding the Reaper - it takes years for hybrids to reproduce and stabilize - Currie asked a friend to taste the new hybrid. \"He took a bite and fell to his knees and threw up, so I knew I had something,\" Currie said.\n\nStomping through one of his pepper fields outside Fort Mill, Currie carries on a nonstop conversation about each hybrid planted among long rows of peppers. He discusses sun, soil, nutrients and taste.\n\nThe peppers are curvy and alluring: orange, red and green spheres glowing in the late autumn sunshine. Currie stops and caresses several plants.\n\nCurrie is an independent person who insists on doing things his own way, and it took him more than two years to fill out the Guinness paperwork. \"I don't follow directions well,\" he said.\n\nFinally, Currie submitted 15 pages of scientific documentation, based on years of testing by chemists at Winthrop University in South Carolina. Their official rating of the Reaper - 1.56 million Scoville heat units - was accepted by Guinness. The Scoville scale is named after the American chemist Wilbur Scoville, who invented a procedure to test pepper heat in 1912.\n\n## Reaper Is Aptly Named\n\nOne scientist's opinion of the Reaper? \"Too darn hot for me to taste,\" said Cliff Calloway, a chemistry professor at Winthrop who tested the Reaper for more than five years using gas chromatography. In fact, he said, just the Reaper fumes and residue on his lab gloves were too hot for him.\n\nThe Reaper is the hottest pepper he has ever tested, Calloway said. The human body responds to the chemical \"heat\" from the Reaper as if it were burned with a match, he added.\n\nCurrie explained that capsaicinoid compounds in peppers attach to taste receptors in the tongue.\n\n\"It tricks the body into thinking it's being burned,\" he said. \"Your body signals that as heat.\"\n\nCurrie grows more than 15,000 chili pepper plants at 30 sites in North and South Carolina, plus sites in four other states, and at his home. He keeps plot locations secret, fearing competitors will sneak in and steal his peppers.\n\nShould anyone else bring out a pepper hotter than the Reaper, Currie is ready. He has eight other hybrids that are hotter than the Reaper, he said. The hottest averages 2.83 million SHUs in scientific lab testing, he said, far higher than the Reaper's 1.56-million rating.\n\n## This One's Top Secret (For Now)\n\nThe hottest pepper - its name is top secret - \"tastes awful,\" Currie said. \"It has a few seconds of flavor, and then the heat builds and builds and just doesn't let up.\"\n\nForty minutes after chewing one, he was still drinking water, he said. He woke up hours later at 2 a.m. \"with an awful gut ball\" - terrible stomach cramps.\n\nCurrie said he's tasted the new hybrid more than 50 times.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"I'm stupid,\" he said.'"

Upper-class housewives emerge from air-conditioned sedans with leather seats.\n\n## Look For The Red Bandana\n\nUnfazed by the din, Mehboob, 45, slides a smaller stool toward a visitor and flashes an inviting smile.\n\n\"Would you like me to clean your ear?\" he asks.\n\nIt seemed an unusual request, particularly on the busy, fast-paced and less-than-clean streets of India's commercial capital. Who in this city has time to stop and get his ears cleaned? And who would think of having it done on the street, by a man with a battered leather bag full of unmarked bottles dangling from his shoulder?\n\nYet swabbing dirt and wax out of people's ears has been Mehboob's business for more than two decades. Amid the snack sellers and cobblers, a few hardy kaan saaf wallahs, as ear cleaners are known in Hindi, still dot the sidewalks of Mumbai. They are identified by the red handkerchiefs tied around their heads.\n\n## A Time-Honored Profession\n\nA young man in an orange plaid shirt approaches Mehboob, who motions toward the empty stool. Gaurav, a 21-year-old housekeeper here for his occasional cleaning, sits down stiffly, like a boy in a dentist's chair.\n\nMehboob props his bag of tools on one leg. He pulls out a steel pin the length of a pencil, wraps the tip in a wad of cotton and guides it toward Gaurav's aural canal.\n\nIn Mumbai, a city of more than 12 million where seemingly no job is too small, many of the last remaining traditional ear cleaners hail from southern India. Some trace the profession to the 18th century.\n\nMehboob, who was born outside Hyderabad, learned the trade when he came to look for work in Mumbai 25 years ago, when it was still known as Bombay. After he had labored in construction for a few years, a fellow southerner taught him how to clean ears.\n\n## \"A Soothing Effect\"\n\n\"It was just something to do,\" he says. In the crowded city, with vehicles and construction sites fouling the air with fumes and dust, getting one's ears professionally cleaned was \"a normal practice,\" he said.\n\nMehboob charges 20 rupees, or about 30 cents, for a standard cleaning of both ears with cotton and hydrogen peroxide. The process takes less time than a good shoeshine. The deluxe treatment can include daubs of lotion, coconut oil and a dark liquid that Mehboob described as an ayurvedic tonic, and costs 50 rupees, or 80 cents.\n\n\"That's if the ear is inflamed, or if it's really red,\" he says. \"The lotions provide a soothing effect.\"\n\nHis method is to dip the cotton-tipped pin in hydrogen peroxide and scrape the outer ear canal before proceeding to the inner canal. An old pair of tweezers helps pick out stubborn bits of dirt and wax.\n\n## Mixed Reputation\n\nA routine day brings about a dozen customers, he says. For long stretches he sits alone in front of a former phone booth, its rusted doors padlocked shut. In the late afternoon, he moves farther down the road, hoping to catch commuters disembarking from a train on their way home.\n\nIt is unlikely that most young people who pass him on the street know what he does, or recognize the meaning of the red turban. Most of his regular customers are elderly, he says, although they are loyal, some even summoning him to their apartment for house calls.\n\n\"Rich people,\" he says proudly.\n\nMumbai's ear cleaners have a mixed reputation. Foreigners tell stories of being accosted near the Gateway of India monument by red-turbaned men waving needles. With the arrival of cotton swabs and a move toward obsessive hygiene, the trade seems destined for extinction.\n\n## The Unsung Of Mumbai\n\nIn a decent month, Mehboob saves around $80 after deducting the little he pays for rent. He shares a room nearby with 15 men - day laborers, taxi drivers, security guards - most of them migrants, all Muslims in a staunchly Hindu neighborhood.\n\nThey are the unsung of Mumbai, the people who run the basic machinery of the city - and then there is Mehboob, a fading relic in every way.\n\nHe owns nothing of value here, not even a cellphone. He deposits his earnings with a broker instead of in a bank, preferring to carry his savings back to his hometown when he returns every few months to visit his family and their tiny plot of farmland.\n\nYet Mehboob has trained his nephew, so there could be at least one more generation of ear cleaners in Mumbai. He dismisses the word of doctors who advise patients with earaches not to visit men like him, warning of infections and scrapes.\n\n\"Of course the doctors say that,\" he says. \"It's good for their business.\"'"

            "text": "\tSHANI SHINGANAPUR, India - Nanasahib Bankar, a prosperous farmer and businessman in this small temple town, worries about a lot of things: sugar cane prices, the health of his cattle, the success of his son's new hotel.\n\nOne thing he doesn't worry about is losing his keys. His house, like nearly all the others here, does not have a door.\n\nBankar stands under the bare door frame of the red-brick house he shares with 12 family members. With arms folded over his protruding belly, the 64-year-old says simply, \"This is the way we have always lived.\"\n\n## It's Bad Luck To Lock Up\n\nLegend has it that Shani, the Hindu god to whom the local temple is dedicated, watches over Shani Shinganapur, preventing crime and punishing thieves. The town of about 15,000 is in western India.\n\nDevotees say that to install a door with a latch or a cupboard with locks would be to question Lord Shani's powers and invite his wrath. Some older residents opt for curtains even for their bedrooms, and most residents do not lock their cars or motorbikes. Shopkeepers say they sometimes leave cash in their drawers overnight.\n\nThe only bank in town has a plexiglass front door but, apart from a safe-deposit box, remains unlocked day and night.\n\nAfter dark, when the wind rustles the palm trees and sugar cane fields, Bankar draws a simple gray curtain across his front doorway. He holds the billowy fabric in place with a slab of plywood. The main threat of a break-in, he said, comes from stray dogs and snakes.\n\nIn a bedroom, Bankar's daughter-in-law, Vaishana, a pretty young woman wearing a sari and dangly white earrings, giggles when asked where she keeps her wedding jewelry, her most valuable possession. She reaches under her bed and slides out a battered blue suitcase.\n\n\"See,\" Bankar says proudly, \"it's not locked and we don't worry.\"\n\n## Mysterious Black Stone\n\nIn a land filled with all kinds of Hindu shrines, Shani Shinganapur's peculiar folklore has brought it a small measure of fame on India's temple circuit. The legend draws thousands of visitors daily to this otherwise-nondescript town, 150 miles east of Mumbai.\n\nThe origins of the temple are as much a part of local legend as the crime-free image.\n\nHundreds of years ago - no one seems to know exactly when - the river running through the village coughed up a 5-foot block of black stone. When the stone was tapped, the story goes, blood oozed from its surface.\n\nResidents say no one dared to move the slab until, one night, a farmer dreamed that the stone spoke to him. It identified itself as Shani, the Hindu god associated with the planet Saturn. \"I want to remain here,\" the stone said, and the next day farmers heaved it up to dry land.\n\nWhen villagers sought to construct a building to house the stone, however, there were mishaps. Walls collapsed. Construction workers suffered injuries. The residents decided that no traditional temple could house Shani, so the shrine consists of a simple open-air platform on which the slab now sits. Then the villagers followed suit by doing away with doors.\n\n## The Legend Is Questioned\n\nOver the years, the legend has grown. Bankar's grandfather would tell how raiders from another village came one night and made off with a bull. They walked and walked, but when the sun rose they found themselves still in Shani Shinganapur, having wandered in circles, and were captured.\n\nTo some, such tales are pure superstition and a ploy for tourists. They say petty crime occurs, but temple officials keep the reports quiet to protect Shani Shinganapur's reputation.\n\nIf the town is so safe, these skeptics ask, why does the temple's donation box have a lock?\n\nFive years ago, a visitor from northern India complained that a tour operator had stolen his camera, cellphone and hundreds of dollars in cash while he was praying in the temple. News reports - their accuracy impossible to confirm - billed it as the first police case in Shani Shinganapur's history.\n\n## Trouble Follows Fame\n\nOne recent afternoon in the center of town, where lines snake around the stone trapezoid that forms the entrance to the shrine, a pickpocket tried to snatch money from a pilgrim but was apprehended. The suspect, police said, was from out of town.\n\nA more subtle form of thievery has taken root as the town's fame grows and more people flock here from other towns for work.\n\nWhen cars with out-of-town license plates roll along the dusty road toward the temple, teenagers on motorbikes tap on the windows, harassing visitors over parking fees. Prices for garlands, ceremonial oil and other religious offerings have also soared. This has prompted temple leaders to post signs warning visitors about jacked-up prices.\n\nFinally, in September, came an unmistakable sign that reality had pierced the town's shaky myth: A police station opened in Shani Shinganapur for the first time.\n\nTwo weeks after the ceremonial opening, a shred of cheap pink ribbon is still affixed to the door frame of Assistant Police Inspector Prashant Mandale's office. It is held in place by two strips of masking tape. The station has a small jail cell, which features a compromise: Instead of a lock, the cell door is held shut by a long metal latch, secured by a bolt out of reach of anyone on the inside.\n\nYes, Mandale says, the police station also has doors, but out of respect for local traditions they do not have locks.'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO, Ill. - For nearly a century, daily insulin shots have been a life-saving treatment for people with diabetes. Now scientists are testing an exciting new question: What if the same medicine could actually prevent the disease - and in the form of a pill instead of a shot?\n\nPeople with diabetes have a difficult time regulating the amount of sugar in their blood. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Typically, people with the disease can inject insulin to help control their blood sugar levels.\n\nThirteen-year-old Hayden Murphy is helping researchers determine whether insulin pills can prevent Type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood. So far, Hayden has been able to dodge the disease, but his little brother, Weston, has not been so lucky.\n\nAt just 5 years old, Weston has to avoid playing too hard and eating too little, which can cause dangerous changes in his blood sugar levels. The little boy's family must prick his fingers several times a day then check his sugar levels by placing a drop of his blood onto a test strip and inserting the strip into a small machine.\n\n## A Capsule A Day\n\nHayden enrolled in the insulin pill study after a blood test showed that he was in danger of developing Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\"When I got the news, I was devastated,\" Hayden said, knowing how much the disease could change his life.\n\n\"He has the daily reminders. He sees what his brother goes through,\" said the boys' mom, Myra Murphy.\n\nNow Hayden swallows a small white capsule daily and has his blood checked periodically for signs of diabetes.\n\n\"I hope it doesn't come to me, and I really didn't want it to come to Weston,\" Hayden said.\n\nHe is one of more than 400 children and adults participating in the insulin pill study. The U.S. government is funding the study, but eight other countries are helping. International partners recruit participants who have gotten the bad news that they have a high risk of developing Type 1 diabetes.\n\n## Researchers Hope For \"Pretty Big Win\"\n\nThis international effort to explore diabetes prevention is not the first experiment involving insulin pills. It is the result of a smaller study that was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nChildren in that study took insulin pills and showed immune system changes that researchers said might help prevent diabetes. But the experiment did not last long enough or look at enough people to know for sure.\n\nThe ongoing international study is much larger and more thorough. Researchers believe it will provide a clearer answer about how insulin pills affect a child's chances of developing Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\"Does it prevent indefinitely? Does it slow it down, does it delay diabetes? That also would be a pretty big win,\" said Dr. Louis Philipson, a diabetes expert at the University of Chicago.\n\n## Perplexing Type 1 Rise\n\nAbout 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is far more common, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide, including almost 30 million in the United States alone. Beyond blood sugar issues, both types raise long-term risks for damage to the kidneys, heart and eyes.\n\nCases of diabetes are occurring more frequently. Experts think the growing number of Type 2 patients has to do with rising obesity and inactivity, but the 3 percent increase in Type 1 cases each year is more perplexing.\n\nThe leader of the insulin pill study, Dr. Desmond Schatz of the University of Florida's Diabetes Center, says doctors know very little about the exact cause of Type 1 diabetes. That makes the disease especially complicated to prevent.\n\n\"For the most part, it's really shooting an arrow into a field and hoping one of the arrows hits a target,\" Schatz said.\n\n## Pinpointing The Triggers\n\nWhen a person has Type 2 diabetes, their body cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a blood sugar-regulating hormone that helps the body convert the sugars in food into energy. Type 2 diabetes can sometimes be treated with a healthy diet and exercise.\n\nIn Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making insulin altogether. Doctors treat Type 1 by replacing insulin in small doses over the course of a patient's lifetime. This is usually done with injections or a small pump.\n\nViruses and other infections have been suggested as possible triggers of Type 1 diabetes since patients' immune systems attack their insulin-producing cells. Genes are also thought to increase risks for the disease.\n\nDiabetes expert Dr. Wendy Brickman explained that the pills in the study are an attempt to sneak insulin into the body. Researchers think that treating insulin like food might trick the immune system so that it will not attack insulin-making cells.\n\nThe new insulin pill study is focused on prevention, but the pills also are being studied as a diabetes treatment. Doctors have had trouble getting insulin into the bloodstream without it being damaged by the digestion process.\n\n## Cautious Optimism\n\nResults from the prevention study are not expected until 2017, so it is still too soon to predict an outcome. If the pills work, they will most likely be less expensive than having a lifetime of diabetes, program director Lisa Spain said.\n\nHayden Murphy and his family are cautiously optimistic. After three years in the study, Hayden shows no signs of diabetes. Still, his mom says she worries every time he seems thirstier than usual - one of the symptoms her youngest boy had before being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes three years ago.\n\nThere is a middle son, too, 9-year-old Daxton, who faces an increased diabetes risk because his little brother has it.\n\n\"It definitely is a life-changing diagnosis,\" Myra Murphy said.'"

            "text": "\tTEHRAN, Iran - World leaders in Geneva negotiated the future of Iran's nuclear development program. In exchange for limiting uranium enrichment, [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) will be freed from certain trade restrictions, known as sanctions. But religious hard-liners here continued to warn of a deceitful West scheming to weaken the Islamic Republic.\n\nYet things are different for the mostly young, jeans-clad set in this busy capital city. Among them, chanting denunciations of the United States is as out of date as 1970s fashion.\n\n\"In art, in fashion, in cinema and in our daily lifestyle, we copycat American culture,\" said Sarah. She is the proprietor of a cozy cafe in the basement of a high-rise in northwestern Tehran. \"There is a big difference between the approved culture and the reality of urban lifestyles in big cities like Tehran.\"\n\nJust as Western views of Iran are far from monolithic, the view here is diverse. Especially among those born after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, roughly half the population. The passage of time, the growth of mass media, satellite television and the Internet have changed things. And the relative ease of travel - many Iranians have relatives in the West and have visited the U.S. and Europe - have helped lighten hostilities since the days of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy.\n\n## Iran's Espresso Crowd\n\nIn June, President Hassan Rouhani won a surprise landslide election. He vowed to reach out to Iran's longtime enemies and addressed a desire to put aside revolutionary chants and end the nation's isolation. He began diplomatic work aimed at ending the economic sanctions, or restrictions against trade with other countries.\n\nMany young Iranians wouldn't be out of place in London, New York or Los Angeles. They gravitate to the snug coffeehouses that have sprung up in recent years. The venues are occasionally subject to crackdowns from the nation's so-called morality police, who arrest women for violating the dress code or confiscate satellite TV dishes for obscene material.\n\nThey appear to view the caffeine-driven gathering spots, though legal, as vaguely seditious. In Iranian culture, tea remains the preferred beverage and men and women are not supposed to mingle together in public.\n\nAmong the espresso crowd, \"Death to USA!\" seems an unwelcome throwback to a distant era. It is the cherished motto of Iran's hard-liners.\n\n\"I wear jeans and I eat fake American fast food,\" said Sasan, 26, seated in a cafe near Revolution Square, who, like others interviewed, asked that his family name not be used because of privacy concerns. \"The Islamic revolutionary culture has not influenced our tastes. In fact, our parents' generation has failed to instill revolutionary values to us.\"\n\n## Waiting For Sanctions To End\n\nIndeed, many younger Iranians see the storming of the embassy and the seizure of U.S. hostages as rash acts that started decades of bad relations and economic isolation. The events were long considered iconic symbols of resistance.\n\n\"It was a blunder that my father's generation committed,\" said Amirali, 26, another cafe patron. \"Why should we suffer for their mistake?\"\n\nSome here eagerly anticipate an end to trade restrictions.\n\n\"My marketing professor was saying that if the United States and Iran resume normal relations, the Iranian middle and upper classes will rush to buy U.S. brand refrigerators, washing machines and so on,\" said Sasan. He is an engineer enrolled in a marketing course to expand his skill set in a sanctions-ravaged economy. \"I believe this 100 percent.\"\n\nThe attraction of Western products was evident on a recent day at a small refreshment stand. A pair of fashionable young businesspeople promoted sugarless fruit juice and Western-style coffee.\n\n\"We are telling our customers that one important ingredient of this juice is imported from the USA,\" said Vida, who flashed jet-black hair beneath her required, but colorful, head scarf. \"How can we chant, 'Death to USA!'?\"\n\n\"We don't want anything to do with politics,\" she added. Her partner, Omid, nodded in agreement. He was a spiky-haired 20-something wearing purple shoes and a black overcoat.\n\n## Graffiti On Empty Buildings\n\nYoung Iranians view those who have profited from the sanctions as reluctant to see any easing of trade bans.\n\n\"This whole 'Death to USA' business is serving the interests of those who make a good living as middlemen breaking the sanctions,\" said Alireza Qajar, 36. He is a plastics importer who was washing down pancakes with French-roast coffee at a cafe.\n\nOne part of the economy that has experienced a sort of boom in the sanctions era is real estate, since affordable housing is perpetually in short supply.\n\nIn some instances, empty buildings slated to be torn down have attracted another Western-oriented, edgy phenomenon. Graffiti artists, like coffee shop patrons, tend to take a dim view of the officially enforced anger toward the West. They see their temporary creations as bold individualist statements against a stagnant society.\n\n\"Here, we are free to express ourselves and vent our frustrations,\" said a tagger who goes by the handle Bum! Bum!. He is part of a crew that recently spent 16 days spray painting the walls of a condemned apartment building with whorls, curlicues and stylized letters and figures.\n\nOnce finished, the crew photographed its work - posting it on the Web before the building was torn down.\n\n\"We have practically lived here for 16 days, eating and sleeping,\" said graffiti artist Shayan, 21, an engineering student with dreams of immigrating to Canada. \"Now we have to find another place to take out our anger.\"'"

The American servicemen visited some of the places where they were held and recounted their memories.\n\nThe men, all in their 90s, opened their tour with a memorial service Monday for fallen soldiers at the Commonwealth War Graves in Yokohama.\n\nAs they marked the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, the emphasis was on forgiveness.\n\nGeorge Rogers, of Lynchburg, Virginia, said he did not hold a grudge against Japan. Now 96, he was taken captive by the Japanese and survived the infamous Bataan Death March in April 1942. The Japanese also forced him to work at the Yawata steel plant in southern Japan, or today's Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corp.\n\n## At 96, \"No Hard Feelings\"\n\nDuring his nearly 3 1/2 years of captivity, Rogers was given meager food rations and sometimes beaten up.\n\nHe said that he was lucky to survive, but that he harbored \"no hard feelings\" toward his captors.\n\n\"Just like we do what we're told to do as far as the Army is concerned, your (Japanese) men do the same thing. They tell them to do it, they do it,\" he said. \"Other than that, I think we lived.\"\n\nA month after Japan's Aug. 15, 1945, surrender, Rogers returned to the United States in skin-and-bones condition, weighing only 85 pounds (about 38 kilograms), despite being 6-foot-3. His doctor told him - he was 26 then - that he would most likely not live past 45 or 50, keep his teeth or have children.\n\nRogers, who still has his teeth, has five children, and one of them accompanied him on his trip to Japan.\n\n## He Survived Bataan Death March\n\n\"They didn't give me any food, and I didn't get much water when I needed it, but other than that, it was a long trip, very far,\" he said.\n\nRogers had hoped to revisit the steel plant where he worked, though the trip did not materialize. However, the Yawata plant was chosen as a World Heritage site and preserved due to its historical significance.\n\nDuring the Bataan march, thousands of prisoners were forced to walk more than 60 miles (97 kilometers), under severe, abusive conditions, and many died.\n\nAbout 132,000 members of the Allied forces, which fought Japan, were held as prisoners across Asia during World War II, including more than 30,000 in Japan, historians say. Of the total, about 35,800, or nearly one-third, died in captivity. The prisoners died at a rate several times higher than prisoners held by Germany and Italy, which also fought against the Allies.\n\n## Visits Aim For Forgiveness\n\nAt Monday's memorial service, the nine veterans, assisted by their family members and U.S. service members, laid flowers for their countrymen who died after being taken prisoner.\n\nThe veterans are visiting Japan at the invitation of the country's Foreign Ministry under a program for reconciliation and forgiveness that started five years ago. They are scheduled to visit some former prisoner-of-war (POW) camp sites in the cities of Osaka, Yokohama and Kamioka, central Japan.\n\nJapan has similar programs with Australia and Britain. Many former POWs still have hard feelings because of harsh treatment by the Japanese.\n\n## He Just Hopes For Peace\n\nIt took 94-year old Arthur Gruenberg, from Camano Island, Washington state, 70 years to come back. The former Marine surrendered at Corregidor, Philippines, in May 1942, and was eventually sent to work in a mine in Fukuoka, in southern Japan. By then he was blind in one eye due to vitamin A deficiency.\n\nGruenberg said he was simply impressed by Japan's postwar development and hoped it remains a peace-loving nation.\n\n\"Everything is just amazing, it's unbelievable,\" he said. \"I can't say it (my feelings) has changed much; I just hope we don't have any more wars.\"'"

            "title": "Juvenile justice program teaches boys life lessons and accountability",
            "text": "\tDALLAS - Most judges don't form personal connections with the offenders who come before the court. Judge George Ashford is different. Each Monday, he meets with minority boys in Dallas County who have gotten in trouble with the law to teach, preach and live by example.\n\nAshford, a black lawyer, is the judge of the Diversion Male Court (DMC), a six-month rehabilitation program for minority boys. DMC is staffed by men of color and was created in response to the racial imbalances in the juvenile justice system. Many of the young boys and girls who get in trouble with the law are black or Hispanic, while the lawyers and judges who are tasked with helping them to reform are often white.\n\nDMC connects minority boys in Dallas to adults with whom they can identify, and who use a variety of methods to help them improve their behavior. DMC is unique in Texas, and there are only a handful of programs like it in the country. Boys who participate in DMC have been accused of everything from aggravated assault to burglary, and the program is their last chance to avoid a juvenile record.\n\n## Emphasizing Life Lessons\n\nMore than simply telling these boys to stay out of trouble, Ashford and his team teach life lessons about accountability, respect, responsibility and empathy.\n\nAccording to Dr. Terry Smith, executive director of the Dallas County Juvenile Department and the woman who started DMC, the program helps boys mature into adulthood. \"These men are teaching them how to be men,\" she said.\n\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas criminologist Alex R. Piquero, a nationally recognized juvenile justice expert, said DMC has an interesting approach to helping youths who get into trouble with the law. \"We should continue to experiment with new approaches and alternatives to sentencing, treatment and rehabilitation,\" he said.\n\nPiquero also noted, however, that programs like DMC need to be evaluated over a long period of time in order to ensure that they are as effective as traditional court when it comes to reforming young offenders.\n\nOne mother, a volunteer minister, described DMC as \"an answer to prayer.\" Her son is relatively new to the program. \"Him getting into trouble was real hard for me. I need him to learn to follow the rules,\" she said. \"I wish they had it when my nephew got in trouble. There wasn't anyone to show they cared.\"\n\n## Know Your Manners\n\nDMC does not sentence boys who have committed crimes with terms of detention or probation. Instead, these boys are enrolled in a multi-level program that promotes their personal growth.\n\nBoys in DMC have to follow a number of rules that dictate how they behave, dress and carry themselves. Whether the boys are chubby-cheeked 10-year-olds barely topping 4 feet tall or gangly 16-year-olds sporting wispy chin hair, they are required to wear pants firmly belted around their hips and collared shirts that are carefully tucked in.\n\nThey are also expected to have excellent manners. \"No, no, no,\" probation officer Herman Guerra admonishes when a boy sits down without pulling out the chair next to him for his mother. Guerra demonstrates: \"Stand behind it; with both hands, pull it out.\"\n\n## Helping Them To Open Up\n\nAshford wears a suit and tie instead of a robe when he talks to DMC boys, and he does not sit on the elevated bench where judges normally command the court. With one boy, he discusses boxing; with another, auto repair. Every conversation leads back to a life lesson.\n\nWhen a small 12-year-old with glasses and a wispy voice sits down, Ashford asks what he did on the recent snow day. The boy mumbles a short answer, and Ashford persists, trying to get the boy to open up.\n\n\"How are you doing now in science?\" he asks.\n\nThe boy's grades are OK. However, James Hill, a probation officer, tells the judge that other kids at the boy's school bully him.\n\nAshford tells the boy that because he has done everything he's been asked, he will be promoted to the next stage of the program, where he will learn new character traits, perform community service and come to court every other week.\n\n## Program's High Expectations\n\nWhen Smith decided to create DMC, she approached veteran juvenile officer Mario Love.\n\n\"I actually laughed,\" Love said, describing his first reaction to the idea.\n\nHe was doubtful that the program could work, and so were Ashford, Guerra and Hill.\n\n\"I'm happy to say I was proven wrong,\" says Love, who is now a passionate advocate for the program.\n\nSince DMC began, 258 boys have been referred by the district attorney's office, the lawyers who normally argue for probation and detention for offenders. Some 143 enrolled in the program, and 25 more are currently under consideration.\n\nDMC is demanding. Probation officers meet with each boy weekly to see if he is abiding by the 7 p.m. curfew and how he is doing at school. The officer also administers random drug tests. Another officer who is in charge of making sure the boy does not skip school may call the boy each morning to wake him up, and text him throughout the day to check on his whereabouts. Each boy must keep up with his school work and is tutored if necessary.\n\nAll participants are required to learn \"character traits\" such as trustworthiness and respect and to write a half-page journal entry every day documenting how these traits affect their behavior.\n\n## Building Blocks Of Character\n\nOverall, the program focuses on building character. Sometimes this requires adapting to the needs of each youth. When Love learned that a 17-year-old in the program had recently become a father, he added parenting classes to the barber classes the boy was already taking.\n\n\"We know you're here because of an offense, but we need to look at what's lacking around you and what services can we put into play to make you a better person,\" Love said.\n\nAccording to Ashford, the program can help kids who have developed bad habits and made bad decisions to turn their lives around. He described how a youth's experience at DMC can lead to a dramatic change. \"He gets some positive influences,\" he said. \"He gets the probation officer who really shows him they are concerned about him, care about him. They get the right kind of feedback from the judge, that, you know, we're really trying to help you. Maybe some of the services kick in, the counseling addresses some issues in the home that help both him and the parent.\"\n\n\"Those cases are deeply satisfying,\" he observed.\n\n## Uncomfortable, But Necessary Topic\n\nRace is central to the structure and approach of DMC, and Smith recognizes that race can be an \"uncomfortable topic.\" \"Does that mean we ignore it?\" she asked.\n\nBlacks make up about 22 percent of Dallas County's juvenile population but about 44 percent of those in the county's juvenile justice system, according to the Juvenile Department. In other words, an unusually large proportion of African-American youth end up in trouble with the law. Experts call this \"over-representation.\" Hispanic youth are slightly underrepresented, meaning that the proportion of Hispanics who enter the juvenile justice system is below average, while white youth are highly underrepresented.\n\nMany experts say that these numbers do not necessarily mean that black and Hispanic kids commit more crimes than white kids do. Rather, minority boys may be more likely to be caught and punished for the crimes they commit because they lack the resources many whites have.\n\n## Biases In The System\n\nDarlene Byrne, a state district judge in Travis County who is president-elect of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, said that there are racial biases in how youths are treated in the juvenile justice system.\n\nExperts point to the case of Ethan Couch, a white teenager who killed four people in Tarrant County two years ago while driving drunk. Couch was 16 at the time of the crash, and it was his third alcohol-related offense, yet a judge did not sentence Couch to serve jail time. It would have been very unlikely for a black teen to receive such a forgiving sentence, the experts say.\n\nPiquero said that it's hard to know why minorities are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system, but argued that biases may not be the whole explanation. \"It's real simple to look at who is in the facilities and say, 'Oh, well the system is totally biased,'\" he said. \"That may be true at some level or to some extent. We just don't know how much.\"'"

            "text": "\tImagine for a moment that all of the nation's fast-food establishments - all the drive-thru windows, the beckoning dollar deals and wafting odor of french fries - were to vanish overnight. Would the number of our kids who carry an unhealthy amount of extra weight plummet?\n\nThe answer is very likely no, says a study published this week in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. You can shut off the supply of 24-ounce fountain drinks, bacon cheeseburgers, fried chicken and stuffed tacos.\n\nBut the children who frequently eat at fast-food restaurants will go home and do what they generally do when not eating at a fast-food restaurant: They'll snarf cookies and chips, chug sugar-sweetened soda from a bottle, and heat up frozen pizzas.\n\nResearchers from the University of North Carolina led by nutrition professor Barry Popkin studied the issue. They found that children who frequent fast-food restaurants tend to eat food that would probably make many of them overweight or [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) anyway. They do this even when they are not eating at those restaurants.\n\nThe authors of the latest research combed through a national database of Americans' health and nutrition behaviors. They grouped 4,466 American kids - from ages 2 to 18 - according to what they ate when they were not eating food purchased at a fast-food restaurant.\n\n## What They Eat, Not Where, Important\n\nParticipants were designated \"Western diet\" consumers if their consumption from non-fast-food sources was relatively high in saturated fats and added sugars. Others were classified as following a \"prudent diet.\" They ate more fruits and vegetables, leaner proteins and less added sugar and saturated fat.\n\nAfter doing so, the authors went back to the children's detailed food consumption record. They categorized some of the children as nonconsumers of fast food. Those children had food tracking records that indicated no calories consumed from a restaurant or eating establishment without servers. Others were called low consumers. Their food tracking records indicated that no more than 30 percent of their calories came from such an establishment. The last group was called high consumers.  More than 30 percent of the calories consumed came from a fast-food restaurant.\n\nThe result: Those who followed the Western dietary pattern when not dining at fast-food restaurants had the highest rates of being overweight or obese. This was true even for those who were considered \"nonconsumers\" of fast food. Those who followed a \"prudent diet\" when not dining on fast food were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese. This was the case even for those who were considered high consumers of fast food.\n\nOn average, low consumers of fast food were 1.5 times as likely to follow a Western diet pattern of consumption than people who were considered nonconsumers of fast food. High consumers of fast food were 2.2 times as likely to do so.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that the location where foods are obtained may not be as important as the nutritional quality of the foods consumed,\" the authors wrote in Thursday's study. They also suggest that \"the effect of public health efforts targeted at fast-food restaurants may also be overestimated.\" Those efforts may be \"necessary but not sufficient to reduce child obesity if the remainder of the diet is not addressed.\"\n\nThe study was sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The authors - Jennifer M. Poti, Kiyah J. Duffy and Popkin - declared they had no financial conflicts of interest with respect to the article.'"

            "text": "\tNOGALES, Ariz. - Lizbeth Mateo paid her tuition on Sunday for Santa Clara Law School, before classes start next month. On Monday, she emailed the school. \"I'm letting them know I may not make it in time,\" she said.\n\nShe could be late because of a protest at the U.S.-Mexico border. Mateo, who is 29 and came to the U.S. illegally at 10, flew back across the border. She was protesting the thousands of people deported over the last five years as the government tries to improve and enforce its immigration system.\n\nMateo and two other young immigrants who came to the U.S. as children protested on Monday in Nogales. They asked to come legally across the border they crossed in secret years ago and had avoided most of their lives.\n\nThe immigration debate has focused on how a bill now in Congress might affect about 11 million people who entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas. Mateo and other protesters say the debate is missing those already expelled from the country. Statistics show deportations went up from just under 300,000 in 2007 to about 400,000 in 2011.\n\n## Asking For Humanitarian Parole\n\nThe protest group on Monday grew quickly. About 30 others joined the activists at the U.S. border, taking them by surprise. The immigrants, organized by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, planned to ask for humanitarian parole, which would let them into the country, or asylum if that failed.\n\nSix other immigrants who had returned to Mexico more than a year ago joined the three protesters. The nine were questioned and transferred to a holding facility in Florence, Ariz. Activists who spoke to their lawyer said that they were denied humanitarian parole, and that immigration officials would consider their request for asylum while holding them in Florence.\n\nImmigration officials wouldn't comment on Monday's events, and have said before that people had to meet standard immigration requirements to enter the country. The protest draws attention to the troubles of children who came to the country illegally. Many have grown up and gone to schools in the U.S. -- like Mateo, who graduated from California State University, Northridge. They hope to keep a connection to their pasts without fear of losing their futures in the U.S.\n\nWith Mateo were Marco Saavedra, 23, of New York and Lulu Martinez, 24, of Chicago. Both came to the United States when they were 3 years old.\n\nSaavedra, who graduated from Kenyon College in Ohio, says he's American in every way, except for having legal papers. He said his 60-year-old grandfather, who lives in Mexico, makes a dangerous trip each time he visits relatives in the United States. \"Why does it have to be almost a death sentence every time he wants to go see his daughters?\" Saavedra asked.\n\n## At Considerable Risk\n\nWearing graduation caps and gowns, Mateo, Saavedra and Martinez chanted \"undocumented, unafraid\" as they paraded Monday from Nogales, Sonora, to Nogales, Ariz. They were joined by five other young immigrants, also dressed for graduation. Unlike the original trio, who had traveled to Mexico to make a political point, four of the others had voluntarily left the U.S. years ago because life had become too difficult. The fifth was deported.\n\n\"They are insane, but my respect is with them,\" Luis Leon, one of the five, said of the other three. \"Nobody throws away 20 years of their lives for someone else.\"\n\nLeon came to the U.S. when he was 5, and had been living in North Carolina. He returned to Mexico in 2011 because he thought U.S. lawmakers would never fix the immigration system, and he regrets that now. He's tried to return to the U.S. six times but without success.\n\nAs they headed for the border, the eight immigrants were joined at the last minute by another who had left on his own before. As word spread, as many as 30 more young people showed up at the border, but their status was not clear.\n\nBy returning to Mexico voluntarily, the three immigrants have put themselves at considerable risk. Under an immigration reform package backed by the Obama administration, young immigrants deported could apply to return to the U.S. But immigration experts say those who leave voluntarily would not have that option.\n\n## Hard Crossing Remembered\n\nMateo, Saavedra and Martinez are old hands at activism and civil disobedience. Saavedra once occupied an immigration facility in Florida, and was detained. Mateo joined a sit-in at the Tucson office of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\n\nThe authorities gave Saavedra and Mateo the chance to apply for a program which lets those who arrived as children stay in the U.S., at least for now. Both turned it down and said they want their cases judged, to put a spotlight on the immigration system.\n\nMateo remembered crossing the desert with her mother to enter the United States 19 years ago. \"I've never been as thirsty as then,\" she said.\n\nShe described how they drank from rank pools of water and how her mother pulled and pushed to keep her going north. Eventually, they settled in Los Angeles.\n\nIf she is deported, Mateo said she wouldn't try to cross the border. She said she couldn't go through that again.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Eliseo Medina usually sits down for a turkey dinner with his family in Oxnard, Calif., on Thanksgiving, filling tacos with stuffing and extra jalapenos.\n\nThis year, the former secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union is feasting on nothing but water. Medina is in the 17th day of his hunger strike to protest Washington's inaction over immigration reform.\n\nWhile the rest of the nation is gorging on Thanksgiving meals, the immigration activist and two other fasters will be in a heated tent on the National Mall at the foot of the Capitol.\n\n\"We are a little thinner,\" said Medina, who has lost 19 pounds. \"It's a good diet.\" He said the goal of the fast was to bring attention to the plight of immigrants. \"We are trying to connect with people on a human level, not on a policy or political level.\"\n\n## Want Reform Sooner, Not Later\n\nMedina, who is gaunt and has a patchy beard and a wooden cross hanging from his neck, says he hopes that his fast will pressure House Republicans. They have held up action on an immigration overhaul.\n\n\"We want to see it sooner rather than later because of all the deaths and the deportations,\" he said.  Roughly 200 people a year die trying to cross the Sonora Desert along the southwest border with Mexico.\n\nSome high-profile Democrats have dropped by his tent to lend support, including Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as well as two Republican members of Congress, Jeff Denham and David Valadao, Californians who support an immigration measure.\n\n\"It is a tremendous commitment, what they have been through,\" Denham said in a telephone interview. \"I think it's going to have an impact with more and more members. ... It helps us bring great recognition to the overall issue.\"\n\nDenham says he pressed House Republican leaders last week to act more quickly. But prospects for legislative action before the end of the year appear dim.\n\n## Nurse Checks Vital Signs\n\nMedina, 67, says his family is worried about his health.\n\nAt night, Medina sleeps in a room of bunk beds with the other fasters at the Washington Seminar Center, a religious retreat on Capitol Hill.\n\nA full-time nurse checks vital signs twice a day for Medina and two other fasters - Dae Joong Yoon, 43, and Christian Avila, 23 - who also stopped eating Nov. 12. The three risk damaging their livers and other organs as the nutrients in their bodies become more depleted.\n\nDuring his fast, Medina has found that he needs less sleep. \"I wake up and start thinking about what more I should be doing. Then I drive my staff crazy,\" Medina said. \"At 1 o'clock in the morning, every idea I have is brilliant.\"\n\nMedina isn't surprised that some Republicans have dismissed the fast as a publicity stunt. \"(They see us as) these ragtag people sitting at the foot of the Capitol reminding them of what they have to do,\" he said. \"It's a hard thing for them.\"\n\nOthers say Medina's fast is raising public awareness in the tradition of labor leader Cesar Chavez, who organized farm workers in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\"It moves people who have been getting complacent and saying, 'It is not going to happen and we should move on and focus on some other issues,' \" said Miriam Pawel, a former Los Angeles Times editor and the author of a forthcoming biography, \"The Crusades of Cesar Chavez.\" \"It reminds people of the injustices.\"\n\n## Inspired By Chavez\n\nWhen Biden sat with the fasters Friday, he told them to call him \"Joe,\" not \"Mr. Vice President,\" Medina said.\n\nMedina would like to see the White House do more. Congressional action is needed to address the problems of the immigration system, but the Obama administration, he said, could use executive orders to slow the rate of deportations and keep more families together. (Pressed by a protester in San Francisco on Monday, President Barack Obama said that he was doing all he could legally.)\n\nMedina recalls being stunned in 1968 when he heard that Chavez was fasting to draw attention to labor conditions on farms. Medina was 22 and had been helping Chavez by organizing a boycott of table grapes in New York City and remembers thinking to himself, \"Is he going to die? What will happen to us?\"\n\nChavez abstained from food for 25 days until New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was about to launch his campaign for president, traveled to Delano, Calif., and gave Chavez a piece of bread to break the fast. \"It was a big validation of what we were trying to do,\" Medina said.\n\nHe says that 1968 fast drove him to get more involved in union activity. He devoted his career to encouraging immigrants to join unions, eventually rising to the No. 2 position at SEIU, which represents janitors, security guards and other service workers, then quit that post earlier this year to lead an advocacy program in Washington for immigration reform.\n\nHe expresses hope that his fast will spur the same kind of change that Chavez's inspired in him.\n\n\"It's been 45 years since that fast, and I've never been let down by the American people,\" Medina said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Many men lost their lives in the Battle of Gettysburg and many were recognized for their bravery. It took more than 151 years, though, for First Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing to be recognized for his heroism with America's highest medal for valor.\n\nOn Thursday, President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Cushing's family in a moving ceremony at the White House.\n\nNormally, the nation's highest medal for bravery is given within a few years of the heroic deed.\n\n\"But sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the passage of time,\" Obama said. \"This medal is a reminder that no matter how long it takes, it is never too late to do the right thing.\"\n\n## Suffered Terrible Injuries\n\nOn July 3, 1863, Cushing, only 22 when he was killed, was the commander of an artillery unit that had been almost completely wiped out by Confederate fire. Despite terrible injuries, he refused to leave his cannon, the only artillery piece in his unit that was helping to hold off the soldiers of the Confederate South. His bravery, along with so many others on the battlefield, helped the North win the Civil War and end slavery.\n\nCushing was awarded the medal through the efforts of Margaret Zerwekh, an amateur historian who researched the Cushing family after moving to the Cushing family home in Delafield, Wisconsin, in the 1960s. As she pored through accounts of Cushing's heroism, she felt he deserved the Medal of Honor.\n\nThrough more than three decades Zerwekh never gave up, despite numerous setbacks. Zerwekh, now 94, was at the White House to witness a ceremony she spent so much time and effort to make happen.\n\n\"He deserved it,\" Zerwekh said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Obama singled out Zerwekh for her efforts, which started in the early 1980s.\n\n\"They say the wheels of democracy grind slowly, but 151 years slow?\" said Wisconsin Representative Ron Kind, who attended the ceremony. He is the descendant of two brothers who fought during the Civil War. \"This is the classic example of how two individuals can make a difference - Alonzo Cushing and Margaret Zerwekh.\"\n\n## \"A Stone In His Name\"\n\nA total of 63 Medals of Honor have been awarded for heroism during the Battle of Gettysburg. Few Medals of Honor have been awarded after death for service in the Civil War, said Laura Jowdy, an archivist with the Medal of Honor Society.\n\nIt took an Army department weeks to track down members of Cushing's family. Cushing died before having children and none of his brothers had children.\n\nReceiving the Medal of Honor was Helen Loring Ensign, 85, of Palm Springs, California, a distant cousin of Cushing through his mother.\n\nWearing a button with Cushing's picture, Ensign stood next to the president as the citation was read.\n\nEnsign has visited Gettysburg many times and stood at the spot where Cushing fell next to his artillery gun, a spot now memorialized with a stone marker.\n\n\"I remember being very, very proud to see a stone in his name. Gettysburg was a part of our family history,\" Ensign said.\n\n## A West Point Graduate\n\nFamily members attending the ceremony included several named Cushing or Alonzo. Some learned of each other through efforts to trace the family tree for the Medal of Honor ceremony, said Ensign's niece Jessica Loring. In Washington, D.C., this week, family members met Zerwekh for the first time.\n\n\"We owe a great debt to her for doing this,\" said Loring.\n\nCushing's family wants to loan his Medal of Honor to museums and schools, Loring said, \"because it's important to show the price of freedom.\"\n\nOn Friday, Cushing will be inducted into the Pentagon Hall of Heroes, and later this month, the Navy cruiser USS Gettysburg will honor Cushing by naming its officer's dining hall after him. Next week, the U.S. Military Academy will add his name to its memorial to graduates who earned the Medal of Honor.\n\nWhile researching his 1993 biography \"Cushing of Gettysburg: The Story of a Union Artillery Commander,\" Kent Masterson Brown read Cushing's letters and journals and learned he was a strong patriot who acted as a father figure to his younger brothers.\n\nCushing graduated in 1861 from West Point, a military school for officers, which he was encouraged by his mother to attend because there was no other way he could afford a college education.\n\n## Commander Of Battery A\n\nOn July 3, 1863, he was commander of Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery, which was stationed on Cemetery Ridge near a small grove of trees on the Gettysburg battlefield. Before the desperate and ultimately disastrous Confederate attack, called Pickett's Charge, Confederate guns practically wiped out Cushing's unit. Soldiers were only a few hundred yards away from each other, trying to kill each other.\n\nPaul C. Jussel, a military studies professor at the U.S. Army War College, said the battle was the last great effort Confederate General Robert E. Lee made for the South. \"Ultimately, it doesn't work and Cushing had a lot to do with that.\"\n\nDuring the Confederate attack Cushing was struck in the shoulder and abdomen, but continued to whisper commands to his soldiers. Historians estimate it was two hours from the time of his initial wounds until he was killed. About 8,000 soldiers were killed during the three-day battle, and more than three times that number were wounded.\n\nAlthough Cushing was told to get medical help, he refused to leave.\n\n\"He said 'No, I'll fight it out or die in the attempt,'\" said Brown.\n\nWhen he was buried at West Point, Cushing was laid to rest underneath a tombstone inscribed \"Faithful until death.\"'"

            "text": "\tCAIRO - On Saturday a Cairo court sentenced former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi to death. Morsi was accused of conspiring with foreign religious extremists to break out of prison and overthrow the Egyptian government.\n\nThe verdict marks a stunning blow to the pro-democracy revolt that sprang up in Egypt four years ago. At the time, thousands of Egyptians rose up against a corrupt police state. The president at the time was named Hosni Mubarak, and he was a brutal leader. Many of the people who were against his leadership, including Morsi, were Muslim. Morsi is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is both a religious and a political group.\n\nSecurity forces had arrested Morsi during the 18-day rebellion in 2011. He escaped from prison several days later. He was then elected president in the country's first free and fair democratic election in 2012, before Egypt's military forced the Islamist leader out of office in a dramatic coup d'etat a year later.\n\n## 2011 Revolt Now Seen As Criminal\n\nSaturday's verdict appeared to criminalize the events of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. The court claimed that Morsi and fellow Islamists conspired with foreign Islamist groups to escape incarceration and stage a violent revolt against the state.\n\nMore than 100 other people were accused, most of whom are not in Egyptian custody, and were also sentenced to death on the same charges. In a separate case, 16 other defendants were given the death penalty. They were accused of leaking state secrets to Iran while Morsi was in power. The judge in those cases did not sentence Morsi, postponing his final verdict until next month.\n\n\"Today will be remembered as one of the darkest days\" in Egypt's history, Amr Darrag, a senior Brotherhood official and former member of Morsi's cabinet, said in an email. Darrag is living in Turkey to avoid prison.\n\n## \"Lies, Hearsay And Paranoid Conspiracy Theories\"\n\nSaturday's judgment was based on \"lies, hearsay and paranoid conspiracy theories,\" the statement said. It is \"another deeply disturbing attempt to permanently erase democracy\" in Egypt, Darrag said.\n\nIn recent months, Egyptian courts have sentenced hundreds of people to death in a series of mass hearings that rights groups have said defy international standards for fair trials. Tens of thousands have been imprisoned.\n\nMorsi's death sentence marks a stunning turnaround for the Islamist leader and the Brotherhood group from which he hails. The movement secured a majority in Egypt's parliament in 2012. Morsi's presidency had offered hope that the country could break the military's decades-long control of government.\n\nHowever, Morsi proved to not be an effective leader. While he granted himself sweeping powers, he failed to bring state institutions under his control. When massive crowds took to the streets to demand Morsi's resignation in June 2013, Egypt's defense minister and current president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, ordered his arrest.\n\nEl-Sissi then presided over a widespread crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and others who opposed his rule.\n\nLast month, another Egyptian court sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison. It charged him with inciting violence against protesters of his government in 2012.\n\n## Charges Included Foreign Connections\n\nSaturday's ruling found Morsi guilty of a supposed grand conspiracy. He was accused of working with operatives from Iran, as well as foreign fighters from both Palestine and Lebanon, who want to push out Egypt's government and make the Muslim Brotherhood more powerful.\n\nThe court alleged that Muslim Brotherhood operatives were trained by fighter groups and Iran inside Gaza, a strip of land bordering Egypt and Israel. It said they later used their expertise to stage the prison break north of Cairo. The court also said that Morsi and the other accused were \"looting poultry and livestock\" from prison grounds. Thousands of prisoners around the country escaped during the uprising four years ago, after Egyptian security forces withdrew from the streets in the face of a popular revolt.\n\nBecause the court's proceedings were closed to the media, it is unclear what proof the court had to prove such a conspiracy. Some of the people charged included fighters who had been jailed in Israel or were dead at the time.\n\nOnly 27 defendants appeared in court Saturday. Morsi arrived smiling and wearing a blue prison uniform.\n\nAs the verdict was read, Morsi and the other defendants chanted against the military.'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE, Wash. - Civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal's story has stirred a national conversation around some of the most sensitive issues in American life today - race, gender, identity and cultural inheritance. Chances are, though, that Dolezal never dreamed that this would be her teachable moment.\n\nDolezal, 37, resigned on Monday as president of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The civil rights organization works to eliminate racial discrimination, particularly for African-Americans or colored people. Dolezal gave up her position amid revelations that she is a white woman pretending to be black. Her character was exposed last week by her white parents, who live in Montana and have not seen their daughter in years.\n\nDolezal's case highlights Americans' conflicting feelings about the country's increasingly multicultural population and about who gets to decide what race people identify with. The swift, loud response to her startling situation swirls around the issue of white privilege and the adoption of a different cultural identity.\n\n## She Resigns NAACP Job As Controversy Grows\n\nThis much is known for sure: An ambitious activist in a midsized city unleashed a storm of anger and sympathy last Thursday. The debate spread across the country and shows no sign of resting. On Monday, Dolezal sent a letter of resignation to the NAACP's national headquarters and posted a lengthy explanation on the Spokane chapter's Facebook page.\n\nShe spoke about the fight that lies ahead to move \"the cause of human rights and the Black Liberation Movement along the continuum ... and into a future of self-determination and empowerment.\" She did not address the allegations that she lied about her race. She did not apologize for the controversy.\n\nBaz Dreisinger is the author of \"Near Black: White-to-Black Passing in American Culture.\" Many people have liberal and flexible ideas about race, she said. Still, \"they're really stuck in a very black-is-black and white-is-white ideology. When a scenario like this comes around to upend those categories, it's a shocker.\"\n\n## At Black College, She Claimed Discrimination\n\nDolezal has been praised for revitalizing Spokane's chapter of the 106-year-old civil rights organization. But according to court documents obtained Monday by the Los Angeles Times, when she was a graduate student in art at Howard University, she sued the historically black school in Washington, D.C. Dolezal  charged that she was a victim of racial discrimination.\n\nShe claimed that university officials removed some of her artwork from a student exhibit in 2001 \"for a discriminatory purpose to favor African American students\" over her, according to an appeals court's summary of her arguments.\n\nHer claims were dismissed by both lower and upper courts. A spokeswoman for Howard University declined to comment Monday, calling the matter resolved.\n\nDolezal recently walked away from a TV reporter who confronted her about her race. The reporter from KXLY in Spokane showed Dolezal a photograph of an elderly black man whose picture was on the Spokane NAACP's Facebook page and asked whether it was her father. \"Yes, that's my dad,\" she replied. Then, when asked whether she is African-American, Dolezal replied, \"I don't understand the question,\" and walked away.\n\n## Her Parents Adopted Four Black Children\n\nDolezal's mother and father, who adopted three African-American children and one Haitian child, say she has passed as black despite not having any African-American heritage.\n\n\"She may have felt that she had some advantage in her activism by being portrayed as a black woman,\" her mother, Ruthanne Dolezal, said on NBC's \"Today\" show Monday morning. \"We hope that Rachel will get the help she needs to deal with her identity issues.\"\n\nRachel Dolezal's father said they had not spoken up about their daughter's race before because they had never been asked.\n\n\"We had never been asked to be involved, we had never been questioned before, but just short of a week ago, we were contacted by the Coeur d'Alene Press,\" Lawrence Dolezal said on the \"Today\" show.\n\n\"I guess it was part of some investigative reporting that was being done and somehow they got wind of us as her parents as a possibility, so they contacted us to see if we were, in fact, her parents,\" Lawrence Dolezal said. \"We taught our children, as we raised all six of them, tell the truth, always be honest. So we weren't going to lie; we told the truth: Rachel is our birth daughter.\"\n\n## Civil Rights Group Liked And Respected Her\n\nThe NAACP national president, Cornell William Brooks, spoke in an interview on Monday with the Times. The disgraced former chapter leader was widely liked and respected in Spokane, he said. There is \"a great deal of disappointment and pain now.\"\n\nBrooks also insisted that \"racial identity is not a qualifying or disqualifying characteristic for leadership or membership within the NAACP. It's just not something that's a criterion. ... It would be surprising to me that it even comes up.\"\n\nWhat is important is the organization's \"institutional integrity,\" Brooks told the Times. \"Having credibility in terms of truth-telling is critically important.\"\n\nWhen asked about the fact that Dolezal lied about her identity, Brooks said, \"No. Lying is not consistent with our values.\"\n\nEd Prince is the executive director of the Washington State Commission on African American Affairs. He said the outrage over the Dolezal case \"goes to the heart of white privilege. An African-American can never wake up and say, 'I'm gonna make my hair blond, put on white makeup and go through my day as a white person.'\"'"

The mostly silent marchers carried flowers and tied black ribbons to railings to honor him.\n\nThe killing of Nemtsov has shaken the Russian opposition, a group of people who disagree with the Russian government's decisions. The opposition sees President Vladimir Putin as responsible for Nemtsov's death. It is unclear, however, whether the shooting will be enough to revive the weakened anti-Putin movement.\n\nThere has been tension in Russia since the country began supporting pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine used to be part of the Soviet Union, which broke up more than 20 years ago. Now, Putin has made several aggressive attempts to bring parts of Ukraine back under Russian rule, some people say.\n\nYet even with Russia's conflict with Ukraine and the country's economic crisis, support for Putin remains strong. In the past year, more than 80 percent of people in the country have said they support Putin.\n\n## A Pile Of Flowers\n\nBack in 2011 and 2012, many anti-Putin protests brought hundreds of thousands to the streets of Moscow. Since then, however, Putin has isolated and intimidated people who disagree with his political decisions. He has jailed some, pushed others into exile, and raised fines and potential jail time for people who are arrested at protests.\n\nAt 55 years old, Nemtsov was among the few opposition figures who refused to back down. Nonetheless, even as they wept at his loss, very few people at the march believed that his death would bring major change in Russia. The government's control over national television, where most Russians get their news, is just too powerful, they said.\n\n\"Maybe if 100 people were to die people would rise up, but I don't really believe in that,\" said Sergei Musakov, 22. \"People are so under the influence of the (TV) box that they will believe anything that television tells them.\"\n\nThe government has called people in the opposition like Nemtsov traitors. Some officials of the government said the opposition leaders were serving the hostile countries in the West, such as the United States and parts of Europe.\n\nAbout 30,000 people went to the march, making it the largest opposition rally in more than a year. The demonstrators carried Russian flags and signs that read \"I am not afraid\" or \"Propaganda kills.\" In the area where Nemtsov was killed, a pile of flowers grew by the minute, as mourners threw bouquets of every color.\n\n## Shot On A Bridge\n\nNemtsov was shot shortly before midnight on Friday as he walked across a bridge near Putin's official residence, the Kremlin. The killing came just hours after a radio interview in which he argued against Putin's actions in Ukraine. Russia has been giving money and support to people in eastern Ukraine who are fighting the Ukrainian government to become a part of Russia once more.\n\nAt the time of his death, Nemtsov was working on a report. He believed he discovered that Russian troops were fighting alongside Ukrainian separatists, despite the government saying otherwise.\n\nOther opposition activists said they hoped Nemtsov's death would encourage people to take action, rather than silence them.\n\n\"Essentially it is an act of terror,\" said Ilya Yashin, an opposition leader and friend. \"It is a political murder aimed at frightening the population, or the part of the population that supported Nemtsov or did not agree with the government. I hope we won't get scared, that we will continue what Boris was doing.\"\n\nMikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister who joined the opposition, told the crowd the killing should be a turning point for Russia. People should \"start reconsidering everything that's going on in our country,\" he said.\n\n## Who Was Behind The Hit?\n\nSince Nemtsov's death, investigators, politicians and political commentators on state television have suggested numerous explanations for the attack. One theory seemed to be that Western secret services were behind the hit. The theory was that the Western secret services killed Nemtsov to create chaos in Russia.\n\nSome bristled at Western media coverage that suggested Nemtsov was killed because he opposed Putin.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had no information on who was behind the shooting.\n\n\"We hope there will be a thorough, transparent, real investigation, not just of who actually fired the shots, but who, if anyone, may have ordered or instructed this or been behind this,\" Kerry said.\n\n## Dim Prospects For Change\n\nFor those at the march, it is the widespread influence of state television that makes the prospects for change seem dim.\n\n\"From my experience, trying to convince people isn't possible,\" said Mikhail Trofimenko, a 42-year-old screenwriter. \"I think things will only get worse, but I hope that by some miracle Russia will not fall apart and remain a united country.\"\n\nHe held up a painting of the Russian flag with four bullet holes in it, the number of times Nemtsov was shot.\n\nAnother mourning march was held earlier Sunday in St. Petersburg, drawing several thousand people.\n\nNelly Prusskaya, a 66-year-old doctor, said she came to pay her respects to Nemtsov. \"I also came to say that I'm against the war in Ukraine,\" she said. \"I'm against political murders.\"'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - The protest chants are angry, but simple: \"I can't breathe!\" \"Hands up, don't shoot!\" \"Black lives matter!\" Demonstrators have shouted these slogans from coast to coast after two grand jury decisions that cleared white policemen in the deaths of unarmed black men.\n\nNow, activists are counting on the rage and pain behind those words to create a new civil rights movement. They want the United States to face the issues of race and police, and push the government to automatically investigate when police abuse their powers.\n\n\"They're asking for something simple. They want to be treated the same,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said of protesters Thursday. De Blasio sought to calm the city experiencing its second day of protests after a grand jury on Wednesday decided not to indict, or charge, policeman Daniel Pantaleo in the killing of a black man.\n\n## Decision Sparks Protests\n\nOn July 17, Eric Garner died after allegedly being put in a chokehold by Pantaleo, a white police officer, during an arrest. Garner's death was captured on cellphone video.\n\nOn Wednesday, mainly peaceful demonstrations broke out in New York soon after grand jury's decision. Protesters blocked major streets and gathered at landmark sites, including Times Square and Grand Central Terminal railroad station.\n\nMore large demonstrations erupted Thursday night in New York and throughout the nation, including Boston, Washington, Pittsburgh and Chicago. As night fell in New York, helicopters thundered over Manhattan while protesters gathered in Foley Square, near the courthouse and police headquarters.\n\n\"It was a murder on video and there was no justice,\" said Mickey Thomas, a 21-year-old Hunter College student. \"I definitely think we've had enough. I feel like there is a new civil rights movement.\"\n\nIda Dupont is a Pace University sociology professor specializing in criminology. She too thought the Garner incident was an \"open-and-shut case\" because of the video.\n\nDupont said she was out protesting to show her outrage.\n\n\"I've been talking to my students about it,\" she said. \"All the young people know something is seriously wrong.\"\n\n## Rally For Change\n\nLast week, violence, arson and looting erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, after a grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, a white policeman, in the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, another unarmed black man. Protesters have taken to the streets almost daily there since Brown's shooting on Aug. 9.\n\nAt a Thursday news conference, black leaders urged protesters from around the country to come to Washington, D.C., for a Dec. 13 rally. They plan to press for federal intervention when police use excessive force.\n\n\"Marches and boycotts led to the '64 Civil Rights Act,\" Al Sharpton, of the National Action Network, said. The Civil Rights Act, passed by Congress in 1964, outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\n\nSharpton said that just as federal legislation led to change 50 years ago, similar action is needed now. He said prosecutors should no longer handle cases involving their own local police force.\n\n## Change Is Being Eyed From The Top\n\nThose pushing for change have the attention of some of the nation's top leaders. These leaders view their demands through personal eyes - from President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who are black, to de Blasio, whose wife is black.\n\nThe New York mayor spoke emotionally this week of the concerns he and his wife had for their 17-year-old son, Dante. \"I couldn't help but immediately think of what it would mean to me to lose Dante,\" de Blasio said. \"Life could never be the same.\"\n\nHolder has launched federal inquiries into several police departments in recent years, which have led the federal Justice Department to order reforms. But those investigations often follow years of claims of abuse. Right now, there is no guarantee an investigation will take place. The black leaders demanded that the Justice Department automatically investigate cases in which law enforcement officials face possible criminal charges stemming from civilian deaths or injuries.\n\nThe impact of Garner's death and the recent case of a 12-year-old black boy killed by Cleveland police could inspire protesters to push for change, experts said.\n\n## \"A Rising Awareness\"\n\nConnie Rice is a civil rights attorney and founder of the Advancement Project in Los Angeles. She said that if the protesters translate their demonstrations into political action, \"we'll see a response that's more than lip service.\"\n\n\"It's a continuation of a very old civil rights era,\" Rice said of the latest cries for change. \"It's not going to look like it did, but that doesn't mean it's new.\"\n\nOne question is whether the current anger will bring actual change.\n\n\"The luxury that some have is to just express outrage,\" Sharpton said. \"Those of us who have the connections to actual victims - we have to sit with them and say how this will achieve justice.\"\n\nDarnell Hunt, a media and race expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said only time would tell whether Sharpton fulfills his goals. But, he said, there does seem to be \"a rising awareness around questions of race and fairness.\"\n\nThe New York Police Department said Thursday it is investigating the officer's actions on the day Garner died. Pantaleo could face punishments, including being fired from the NYPD, said Lieutenant Colonel John Grimpel, a department spokesman.\n\nPantaleo and the police officers union have denied that he used a chokehold on Garner, which is banned by police rules.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - He was a high school dropout, sometime community college student and failed Army recruit.\n\nBut Edward Joseph Snowden eventually used his computer skills for America's spy services, rising from a lowly security position to life as a well-paid temporary worker for the National Security Agency. At age 29, he rented a bungalow with his girlfriend north of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and claimed to earn $200,000 a year.\n\nOn Monday, hours after he admitted disclosing a trove of intelligence secrets to the media, Snowden checked out of the glitzy Mira Hotel in Hong Kong, and then dropped out of sight.\n\nThe secrets he revealed included U.S. government programs that tracked information about people's telephone calls and Internet usage.\n\nWhether he has gone into hiding, is seeking asylum with a sympathetic government, or been taken into custody by U.S. or Chinese authorities, is unclear.\n\n## Patriot Or Traitor?\n\nAlso unclear is how the American public will view Snowden's actions. Before fleeing, Snowden gave a 12-minute videotaped interview to _The Guardian_, the British newspaper that broke many of his disclosures. He said he was determined to shine a light on what he called the federal government's almost unlimited tracking of private citizens' phone calls and Internet usage.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg, who leaked a secret report about how the U.S. government misled the public about the Vietnam War in the 1970s, told the Associated Press that Snowden's leaks were the \"most significant disclosures\" in the nation's history, and said what the government was doing was \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nBut others say that what Snowden did could hurt the U.S. war on terror, and was illegal.\n\n\"I don't look at this as being a whistle-blower. I think it's an act of treason,\" U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) told reporters. Other lawmakers have voiced similar sentiments.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Obama administration, saying that the telephone data collection program was illegal. It asked a judge to stop the program and get rid of the records.\n\n## Public Supports Security Over Privacy\n\nSo far, public opinion has come down on the side of preventing terrorism, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center and _The Washington Post_.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of those polled said investigating security threats takes a higher priority than preserving personal privacy. Younger Americans were more likely to favor privacy. But even a slight majority of people under 30 still came out for investigation.\n\nSnowden chose privacy.\n\n\"I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,\" he said.\n\nSnowden was born in North Carolina. His family soon moved to a Baltimore suburb near NSA's vast headquarters at Fort Meade. He told the _Guardian_ that he struggled in high school, eventually dropping out. A neighbor recalled him as a quiet boy who often was on his computer.\n\nHis parents are divorced. His father, Lonnie Snowden, was an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, according to public records, and lives in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley. His mother, Elizabeth Snowden, is chief deputy clerk in charge of administration and information technology at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore.\n\nA spokeswoman for Anne Arundel Community College said an Edward Joseph Snowden took classes there intermittently from 1999, when Snowden was about 15, through the fall of 2005. He earned a high school equivalency degree, but did not get a college degree.\n\n## From Soldier To Spy\n\nIn May 2004, Snowden enlisted in the Army, hoping to join the Special Forces. He reported to Fort Benning, Ga., but was discharged four months later, the Army said Monday.\n\nSnowden told the _Guardian_ that he left the Army after he broke both legs in a training accident.\n\nThe following year, Snowden got his start in intelligence by landing a job as a \"security specialist\" at the Center for the Advanced Study of Languages at the University of Maryland. The center is run by the NSA.\n\nAfter that, Snowden said, his computer skills helped him get a job with the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn 2007, he said, the CIA sent him to Geneva for two years to maintain security for the CIA's computer network. The CIA considers Geneva an important spying base because it hosts so many foreign diplomats and financial institutions.\n\nSnowden said he began to grow disillusioned with the CIA while in Switzerland. He claimed that CIA officers deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk, and then offered to fix his drunken-driving arrest if he agreed to disclose secret financial information.\n\n\"I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good,\" he said.\n\nStill, Snowden continued to move up the ranks in the intelligence community. He passed a government background check which made him easily employable in the private sector, and in 2009, he left the CIA to work as a contractor at an NSA facility on a military base in Japan.\n\nThat's when he first saw the astonishing breadth of the cyber-agency's surveillance capabilities, he said.\n\n## A Civil Liberties Proponent\n\nSnowden became a firm proponent of civil liberties. His laptop bore a sticker promoting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that advocates for Internet users' rights.\n\nIn 2012 he made two contributions totaling $500 to the presidential campaign of Ron Paul, the libertarian Republican congressman from Texas, according to federal records.\n\nSometime that year, Snowden moved to Honolulu. Last March, he took a job with Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor, as an infrastructure analyst at the NSA's huge mountaintop facility on Oahu. He rented a single-story blue bungalow in Waipahu, an upscale suburb 10 miles from the NSA facility.\n\nBooz Allen said Tuesday that it had fired Edward Snowden \"for violations of the firm's code of ethics and firm policy.\"'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK - Voters in New York City elected their first Democratic mayor in two decades on Tuesday, choosing Bill de Blasio, who ran on a liberal, tax-the-rich platform.\n\nHis plans contrasted sharply with billionaire Michael Bloomberg's record during 12 years in office.\n\nDe Blasio, 52, the city's public advocate, defeated Republican Joe Lhota, former chief of the metropolitan area's transit agency.\n\nHe will take office on Jan. 1 as the 109th mayor of the nation's largest city. He had been heavily favored, holding an overwhelming lead in the polls for weeks.\n\n## \"Tale Of Two Cities\" Campaign\n\nBloomberg, who first ran as a Republican and later became an independent, guided the city through the financial meltdown and the tough period following 9/11. He is leaving office after three terms.\n\nDe Blasio ran as the anti-Bloomberg. He railed against economic inequality and portrayed New York as a \"tale of two cities\" - one rich, the other working class - under the pro-business, pro-development mayor. Bloomberg made his fortune from the financial information company that bears his name.\n\nDe Blasio, who hails from Brooklyn, reached out to New Yorkers he contended were left behind by the often Manhattan-centric Bloomberg administration. He called for a tax increase on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten. De Blasio also pledged to improve economic opportunities in minority and working-class neighborhoods.\n\nHe decried alleged abuses under the police department's stop-and-frisk policy. His campaign enjoyed a surge when a federal judge ruled that police had unfairly singled out blacks and Hispanics under the policy. The candidate, a white man married to a black woman, also received a boost from a campaign ad featuring their son, a 15-year-old with a big Afro.\n\nDespite his reputation for idealism and optimism about his political goals, he has also shown a practical and businesslike side. De Blasio worked for both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and was known for closed-door wheeling-and-dealing while serving on the City Council.\n\n## Voters Hungry For Change\n\nLhota, 59, slammed de Blasio's \"tale of two cities\" appeal as class warfare. He argued that de Blasio's time in the 1980s with the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua as an aid worker and activist made him a Marxist.\n\nLhota also credited stop-and-frisk with contributing to the city's drop in crime. He charged that a de Blasio victory would return the city to its crime-filled past, a point he made with a TV ad that showed images of violence from decades ago.\n\nPolling shows New Yorkers mostly approve of Bloomberg's policies. But those same surveys revealed the city was hungry for a change.\n\nWhile registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city 6-to-1, the last time a Democrat was elected mayor was 1989. David Dinkins, de Blasio's former boss, was victorious then.\n\n## Lhota Campaign Struggled\n\nIf de Blasio's margin of victory holds, it will surpass Abe Beame's 40-point win in 1973 as the largest by a non-incumbent since five-borough elections began in 1897.\n\nLhota, a one-time deputy mayor to Rudolph Giuliani, announced his mayoral bid on a surge of acclaim for his leadership of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority during last year's Superstorm Sandy. But his campaign struggled out of the gate, and he was slow to raise money.\n\nDe Blasio was an afterthought for much of the crowded Democratic primary, spending most of the year in a distant fourth, trailing City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, former Rep. Anthony Weiner and the Democrats' 2009 nominee, Bill Thompson.\n\nBut Thompson's campaign never ignited, and Quinn could not shake her role in the decision to amend the city's term limits to let Bloomberg run again in 2009. When Weiner's support imploded after another sexting scandal, many of his backers went to de Blasio.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - In an effort to energize his slow second term, President Barack Obama made a promise on Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. He vowed to sidestep Congress \"whenever and wherever\" necessary to close the economic gap between rich and poor. He revealed an array of modest executive actions, including an increase to the minimum wage for federal contract workers. He is also planning to make it easier for millions of low-income Americans to save for retirement.\n\n\"America does not stand still and neither do I,\" Obama declared in his prime-time address. A joint session of Congress was present and millions of Americans watched his speech on television.\n\nObama's hour-long address served as the opening charge in a midterm election fight to control Congress that will quickly consume Washington's attention. Democrats are seeking to cast Republicans as uncaring about the middle class. They have urged Obama to focus on the gap between the wealthy and poor, and to help kids born poor get a chance to enter the middle class. His emphasis on executive actions was greeted with shouts of \"Do it!\" from many members of his party.\n\nDeclaring 2014 a \"year of action,\" Obama also sought to convince a doubtful public that he still holds power in Washington even if he can't crack through a divided Congress. The White House was burned by a series of legislative failures in 2013. Now, the president's aides say they're redefining success not by what Obama can jam through Congress but by what actions he can take on his own.\n\n## Wages And Health Care\n\nObama had only a few proposals for action by lawmakers. What he had was largely focused on old ideas that made little progress over the past year. He pressed Congress to revive a stalled immigration overhaul. He also wants to pass an across-the-board increase in the federal minimum wage and give more children access to early childhood education.\n\nRepublicans have lost popularity in recent months, too. They have also been talking about income inequality in recent months. But they blame the widening gap between rich and poor on Obama's economic policies.\n\nAt an emotional high point in the speech, Obama singled out Cory Remsburg. Remsburg is an Army Ranger who was a guest of first lady Michelle Obama. He was nearly killed in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) during one of his 10 deployments. He rose slowly from his seat and was greeted by long and thunderous applause from the president and lawmakers.\n\nEven as Washington increasingly focuses on income inequality, many parts of the economy are gaining strength. Corporate profits are soaring and the financial markets are hitting record highs. But with millions of Americans still out of work or struggling with wages that haven't increased in years, Obama has found himself in the sometimes awkward position of promoting a recovery that feels distant for many.\n\n\"The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead,\" Obama said. \"And too many still aren't working at all.\"\n\nThe president earned some of his loudest applause - at least from Democrats - when he took on lawmakers who oppose his health care law. The law floundered in its initial rollout last fall. Obama said that while he doesn't expect to convince Republicans on the merits of the law, \"I know that the American people aren't interested in refighting old battles.\"\n\n## \"Give America A Raise\"\n\nThe president's speech drew an interesting mix of visitors to the House chamber. Among those sitting with Mrs. Obama were two survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing, as well as Jason Collins, an openly gay former NBA player.\n\nRepublican House Speaker John Boehner brought business owners from his home state of Ohio who say Obama's health care law is hurting their companies. Willie Robertson, a star of the television show \"Duck Dynasty,\" also scored a seat alongside Republicans.\n\nThough Obama sought to emphasize his presidential powers, there are limits to what he can do alone. For example, he can raise the minimum hourly wage for new federal contractors from $7.25 to $10.10, as he announced. But he'll need Congress in order to extend that increase to all of America's workers.\n\nRepublicans quickly said this plan was ineffective. Said Boehner: \"The question is how many people, Mr. President, will this executive action actually help? I suspect the answer is somewhere close to zero.\"\n\nWhite House officials countered by saying many more working people would benefit if Congress would go along with Obama's plan to raise the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) for everyone.\n\n\"Give America a raise,\" Obama declared.\n\n## Immigration Law Makeover\n\nThe president also plans to pass a law to help workers whose employers don't offer retirement savings plans. He wants to help companies that hire the long-term unemployed, and he wants to create programs that train workers and improve environmental policies.\n\nThe president's plan to make changes himself is, in a way, his admitting that he failed to make good on two major promises to the American people: that he would unite Washington and that his re-election would clear the way for congressional action on major projects.\n\nSome Republicans have warned that the president's focus on executive orders could backfire by angering Republican leaders.\n\nObama isn't abandoning Congress completely. He made a renewed pitch to make over the nation's immigration laws, perhaps his best opportunity for signing major bills into law this year. But it is unlikely, with many Republicans against Obama's plan to create a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people already in the U.S. illegally.\n\nSeeking to give Republicans some room to maneuver, Obama did not specifically call for a citizenship pathway Tuesday, saying only, \"Let's get it done. It's time.\"'"

They have also faced their share of criticism.\n\nA radio host once said Amy Carter was ugly. Susan Ford had her dates critiqued. Chelsea Clinton's appearance was criticized. In recent decades, it has been almost all girls and young women who have become targets.\n\nNow, biting criticism of Sasha and Malia Obama by a Republican congressional aide has sparked a round of outrage. The outrage is particularly strong among African-Americans who consider the Obamas an example of black family success.\n\nThe fact that Obama is the first African-American president means a lot to people, said James Peterson, director of Africana studies at Lehigh University.\n\n\"The symbolic nature of this president and this first family in many black households outweighs the substance of the presidency itself,\" Peterson said. \"I'm a substance guy, but the symbolic nature of this president is a force to be reckoned with.\"\n\n## Social Media Has Far Reaches\n\nElizabeth Lauten, communications director for Representative Stephen Fincher, a Tennessee Republican, reportedly resigned Monday after receiving heavy criticism on social media for a post on her Facebook page. Lauten's post sharply criticized Obama's teenage daughters last Wednesday during the annual pardoning of a Thanksgiving turkey at the White House.\n\n\"Try showing a little class,\" Lauten wrote on Facebook. \"Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.\"\n\nLauten apologized Friday on Facebook. \"I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged as a teenager,\" Lauten wrote.\n\nBut the damage had already been done.\n\n\"Black folks might not be gung-ho for Team Obama these days, but the Obama girls are untouchable,\" said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African-American studies at Duke University. \"When (Lauten) discussed them lacking class, that not only struck a chord with blacks but with non-blacks, because the Obamas are viewed as role models for families.\"\n\n## Former First Daughters Were Targets\n\nToday, criticizing presidential children - especially young ones - is considered off limits, but the practice is almost as old as our country itself.\n\nFormer first daughter Patti Davis wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia on Sunday. She noted that she was criticized for an outfit she wore to an event with Queen Elizabeth II when her father, Ronald Reagan, was president. \"There were 150 people there; 149 of them were properly dressed,\" she said the journalist wrote.\n\n\"As first daughters, you can't win,\" Davis wrote to the girls. \"There will always be (mean) people sitting at their keyboards, seething with anger at their own lives, ready to take it out on you.\"\n\nFirst daughters Amy Carter and Chelsea Clinton both came under particularly harsh criticism. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh once called Carter the \"most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country.\" He eventually apologized.\n\n## Chelsea Bites Back\n\nLater, holding up a photograph of then 13-year-old Clinton on his 1993 television show, he asked his viewers, \"Did you know there is also a White House dog?\"\n\nClinton has said that she developed a thick skin as a way to deflect attacks.\n\n\"I have the dubious honor of being compared to a dog as a 13-year-old by Rush Limbaugh,\" she said earlier this year, addressing the National Conference for College Women Student Leaders at the University of Maryland. \"That was not about me, that was about him.\"\n\nPresident George W. Bush's twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, were criticized for underage drinking and for sticking out their tongues at photographers.\n\nHistorian Doug Wead, a staffer in the George H.W. Bush White House who wrote about what he called the \"triumph and tragedy\" of first families in the book \"All the Presidents' Children,\" says the critiques of first families stretch back into earlier eras.\n\n## History Of First Children In The Crosshairs\n\nIn 1966, Lyndon Johnson's 18-year-old daughter Luci complained that \"we don't get paid, but we sure get criticized.\"\n\nIn a Newsweek magazine interview, she noted that when her grades \"weren't so good, complete strangers scolded me. And they got better and we sort of leaked the news about my B average - people said I was bragging.\"\n\nSusan Ford was criticized for wearing blue jeans in the White House and had her high school dates critiqued.\n\n\"I kept thinking, 'I want to be normal. But I can't be normal,'\" she said at the time. \"Everyone was watching.\"\n\n\"The idea that children aren't involved, that it's taboo, is incorrect. But in recent times we've all been very respectful,\" Wead said.\n\nHe said he thought that was why Lauten's remarks were so controversial.\n\n\"The American people instinctively realize that whatever political differences they may have with the Obamas, they're good parents and you can see that,\" he said.\n\n## On Alice Roosevelt's Heels\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's oldest daughter, Alice, moved into the White House when she was 17. Her behavior constantly brought her under close scrutiny.\n\n\"The pulpits of America were filled with sermons every weekend about Alice Roosevelt,\" Wead said. Roosevelt smoked, and she drove a car by herself. When she drove from Washington to New York, the press would follow as if it were Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic, Wead said.\n\nAt one point, President Roosevelt told an exasperated visitor, \"I can run the country and I can be a father to Alice Roosevelt, but I can't do both.\"'"

Obama used the historic occasion to try to put back together a \"coalition of conscience\" to bring about wider equality.\n\n\"In the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president spoke at a ceremony on the anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The 1963 protest became the most iconic moment of the civil rights movement. Obama, the first African-American president, spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where King described his dream of racial equality as many black Americans still struggled to vote.\n\nObama's remarks capped several days of events in Washington observing the anniversary. Thousands marched Saturday on the National Mall to call attention to current civil rights causes: gay and lesbian rights, voting rights and gun laws. The commemoration Wednesday was a more solemn and polished affair. Speakers included former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, Oprah Winfrey and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only speaker from the 1963 march.\n\n## Cites King As An Inspiration\n\nThe president addressed a crowd lined up along the reflecting pool and huddled under umbrellas on a drizzly summer day. Obama paid tribute to the 1963 marchers, both King and \"those ordinary people who names never appear in the history books.\"\n\nHe noted that \"no one can match King's brilliance\" but called on all citizens to keep up the fight for more opportunity. \"The arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice,\" he said, quoting King. \"But it doesn't bend on its own.\"\n\nObama has often cited King as an inspiration and a touchstone. The president's speeches regularly quote King, or borrow from his writings. The president has a bust of King and a copy of the program from the original march in the Oval Office. Obama took the oath of office this year using a Bible owned by King. The gestures have cemented a symbolic connection between the two most recognizable black leaders in U.S. history.\n\nBut Obama's relationship with the civil rights movement is not so simple. Obama, whose mother was white and father Kenyan, has wrestled with this racial identity and his connection to the movement that defined a generation of black political life.\n\nHe has identified with the Joshua generation, the label given to the children of the movement's founders who are tasked with carrying on the work and the memories. Yet Obama has also criticized the civil rights movement, saying it is fractured.\n\n## Talking About Race In America\n\nObama on Wednesday repeated some of that critique. Over the years, legitimate outrage over discrimination devolved into \"excuse-making for criminal behavior,\" Obama said. \"What had once been a call for equality of opportunity ... was too often framed as a mere desire for government support. As if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child.\"\n\nAs president, Obama has been criticized for dodging direct conversations about race in America, although he has recently spoken more candidly about the discrimination he sees in the criminal justice system, as well as inequality in education and economics.\n\nObama also has grappled publicly with living up to King's teachings on nonviolence - to meet \"physical force\" with \"soul force\" - while fulfilling his role as commander in chief of the U.S. military.\n\nAs he spoke Wednesday, his administration was weighing a missile strike against the government of Syria in response to chemical attack that killed hundreds in Damascus suburbs a week ago.\n\nAdministration officials have described the attack as a moral outrage. They suggested that a military response is justified.'"

            "text": "\tEnding a year of speculation, President Barack Obama's presidential library and museum will be built in Chicago, the president and first lady announced Tuesday.\n\nIn a video, the Obamas said the library will be located on the city's South Side. No decision has been made yet whether it will be built in Jackson or Washington parks.\n\n\"All the strands of my life came together and I really became a man when I moved to Chicago,\" the president said in the video, which showed him seated with his wife. \"That's where I was able to apply that early idealism to try to work in communities in public service. That's where I met my wife. That's where my children were born.\"\n\n## First Lady Considers Herself \"A South Sider\"\n\nMichelle Obama, who is from Chicago, said she was \"thrilled to be able to put this resource in the heart of the neighborhood that means the world to me. Every value, every memory, every important relationship to me exists in Chicago. I consider myself a South Sider.\"\n\nThe Barack Obama Foundation, which is in charge of the project, said it would seek out universities, community leaders and organizations as it sketches out plans for the library.\n\nFor more than a year, the University of Chicago had been engaged in a fierce competition with Columbia University in New York, the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\n## Project Will Include All Finalists\n\nThe University of Chicago has pledged to make resources available for the library. The foundation said it also plans to work with the three other universities that were finalists.\n\n\"The foundation intends to maintain a presence at Columbia University for the purpose of exploring and developing opportunities for a long term association,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\n\"In addition, the foundation will work with the state of Hawaii to establish a lasting presence in Honolulu,\" the foundation said.\n\nAlthough Obama was born in Hawaii, the University of Chicago had long been considered the front-runner. However, its bid to build the library on the South Side became caught up in a battle over the use of public parkland.\n\n## City's Election Delayed Announcement\n\nThe original plans to announce the library in March were delayed until after the April 7 election for Chicago mayor.\n\nIn late April several news organizations, including the Chicago Tribune, reported that Chicago had been selected to host the library.\n\nThe decision ends a yearlong competition that began with 13 proposals that eventually were narrowed down to four finalists.\n\nThe University of Chicago had long been considered the most likely candidate. Obama taught constitutional law there for a dozen years and first lady Michelle Obama formerly worked there as a hospital administrator. Chicago's South Side also is where Obama launched his political career as a state senator in 1996 and where the first lady was born.'"

            "title": "Michelle Obama gets ready to fight for healthier foods in school lunches",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Michelle Obama has steered clear of most messy legislative battles. But on Tuesday the first lady publicly took on lawmakers, food companies and lunch ladies who say the school lunch law she championed nearly four years ago is leading kids to brown bag it.\n\nThe attempt to scale back new nutrition standards for the [federal school lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) is unacceptable, Obama declared. She delivered the remarks at a meeting with school nutrition officials that launched her public campaign to defend the law. The first lady blasted lawmakers for playing \"politics with our kids' health.\" She suggested they were trying to \"roll back everything we have worked for.\"\n\nShe said, \"It's unacceptable to me not just as first lady, but also as a mother.\"\n\nThe unusually confrontational remarks were a departure for the first lady. She has largely sought to work with the food industry and around Congress in her campaign against [childhood obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). As the nation's best-known healthy-eating advocate, Obama has typically emphasized partnerships and pledges with the makers of gummy fruit snacks and sweetened cereals. She's been aiming for incremental changes in their products and increased marketing of healthier options.\n\n## Whole Grains, Fresh Fruit\n\nThe Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 set new standards for school food. But since pushing for the law, Obama has rarely waded into legislative or regulatory debates. The law set guidelines for the amount of sodium in school lunches and breakfasts and targets for more whole grains and fresh fruit.\n\nThe law is being challenged in Congress. The School Nutrition Association, a coalition of school officials and the food companies that sell mini-pizzas and chicken nuggets to schools, wants the law gone. Its members include Pizza Hut, Coca-Cola, Chobani Greek yogurt and Tyson Food Service, according to the group's website.\n\nThe group supported the law in 2010, but now its leaders say the regulations it created are too rigid.\n\nHouse Republicans have backed the group's efforts. A House committee is to vote Thursday on a provision that would allow school districts that have been operating at a loss to seek a one-year exemption from the nutrition guidelines. The measure is expected to win approval in the House.\n\nThe exemption is aimed at schools that have seen resources slide. In some districts, more paying students are opting out of school lunches and bringing their own food. Some districts say they have had trouble finding affordable products that meet the nutrition standards. Meanwhile, they say, they have watched students throw away large amounts of the healthy food that land on their trays.\n\n## Fruits And Veggies Optional?\n\n\"These new federal regulations should not drive local school nutrition programs underwater. This temporary one-year waiver simply throws them a lifeline,\" said Brian Rell, a spokesman for Republican Rep. Robert B. Aderholt of Alabama, chairman of the agriculture subcommittee, which approved the provision last week.\n\nSupporters of the exemption described it as a modest attempt to add flexibility to the program. They said the first lady's response seemed out of proportion.\n\nBut the White House has appeared eager to play offense to protect a key piece of how the first lady will be remembered. White House officials helped with a letter by former presidents of the School Nutrition Association opposing the exemption plan.\n\nThe association is also seeking other changes to the law. They propose scrapping a requirement that foods be 100 percent whole-grain by July 2014 and sticking with the current 50 percent target. They want to hold to the newly enacted standard for sodium rather than a lower target scheduled to go into effect in a few years. And they support eliminating the requirement that students take a fruit or vegetable, regardless of whether they plan to eat it.\n\n## Is Pizza Sauce A Vegetable?\n\nThe association \"does not want to gut the nutrition standards - we support many of the requirements,\" said Leah Schmidt, president. \"Our request for flexibility under the new standards does not come from industry or politics. It comes from thousands of school cafeteria professionals who have shown how these overly prescriptive regulations are hindering their effort to get students to eat healthy school meals.\"\n\nThe White House argues that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the program, has been flexible. The USDA already delayed a whole-grain provision for pasta. This was in response to complaints that some such pastas were unpopular and could be hard to find. Officials argued against having lawmakers determine what is healthy, noting that lawmakers have bent to food industry complaints in the past, such as an effort in 2011 to classify pizza with tomato sauce as a vegetable.\n\n\"What we're not going to do is put politics and interests ahead of what's good for our kids and allow politicians to set nutrition standards,\" said Sam Kass, director of the first lady's anti-obesity campaign. Kass is also the White House chef. He said the first lady's office hoped to amplify the voices of those school officials who think the guidelines are helping kids eat healthier diets. The USDA estimates that 90 percent of schools are in compliance.\n\nOn Tuesday, David Binkle, director of food services for the Los Angeles Unified School District, joined the first lady for the event. Binkle noted that he was a member of the School Nutrition Association. But he said its \"hard line\" on the law did not reflect his views. Binkle said he had not had trouble procuring food that meets the federal guidelines or stricter local nutrition standards. He also noted that the \"plate waste\" critics point to was a problem before the 2010 law.\n\n\"In fact, we don't serve the typical corn dog and chicken nuggets,\" he said. \"We don't even have pizza on the menu.\"'"

            "text": "\t_The following is a speech that President Barack Obama gave on Oct. 1, in response to a shooting that killed 10 people at a community college in Oregon._\n\nThere's been another mass shooting in America - this time, at a community college in Oregon.\n\nThat means there are more American families - moms, dads, children - whose lives have been changed forever. That means there is another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relive their own pain, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.\n\nI've been to Roseburg, Oregon, where the shooting took place. There are really good people there. I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today.\n\n## A Blanket Of Comfort For The Grieving\n\nIn the coming days, we'll learn about the victims - young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will cover everyone who is grieving with our prayers and our love.\n\nBut as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to stop this violence from happening someplace else in America - next week, or a couple of months from now.\n\nWe don't yet know why this individual did what he did. And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, no matter what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or who want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.\n\n## Gun Laws Must Change To Prevent More Tragedy\n\nEarlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, \"The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws - even in the face of repeated mass killings.\" And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine, as does the conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this.\n\nWe talked about this after shootings such as the ones in Columbine, Colorado, and in Blacksburg, Virginia. We talked about it after the shootings in Tucson, Arizona; in Newtown, Connecticut; in Aurora, Colorado, and in Charleston, South Carolina. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.\n\nAnd what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out: We need more guns, they'll argue. We need fewer gun-safety laws.\n\nDoes anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country and they know that it's not true. We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws - including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.\n\n## More Guns Do Not Equal More Safety\n\nThere is a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the idea that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, is not borne out by the evidence.\n\nWe know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to create laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. These countries include friends of our government such as Great Britain and Australia. These are countries like ours.\n\nAnd, of course, what's also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama made this issue political. Well, this is something we should make political. It is relevant to our common life together. I would ask news organizations - because I won't put these facts forward - have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports. This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you. We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil. And we should do this. But we still have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting more data, or information, on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?\n\n## We Must Stand And Face The Victims Of Our Inaction\n\nThis is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce car deaths. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives. So the notion that gun violence is somehow different -- that our freedom and our Constitution forbids any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations -- doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up. If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.\n\nAnd I would particularly ask America's gun owners to think about whether your views are properly being represented by the organization that suggests it's speaking for you.\n\n## How Many Must Die Before We Embrace A Change?\n\nAnd each time this happens I'm going to bring this up. Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws. This is not something I can do by myself. I've got to have a Congress and I've got to have state lawmakers and governors who are willing to work with me on this.\n\nI hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my remaining time as president to offer my condolences to families for something like this. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say, and it can change.\n\nMay God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May He bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back. And may He give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The American public feels unusually poorly about the direction of the country and is increasingly fed up with Washington gridlock. It's so bad that President Barack Obama is facing his worst disapproval ratings since he took office.\n\nPeople gave elected officials unusually low grades, according to a new McClatchy-Marist poll. About a third rated them \"D\" and 38 percent gave them an \"F,\" .\n\n\"The lack of confidence in Washington to right itself is showing up,\" said Lee Miring, who is director of Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York.\n\nObama's disapproval rating climbed to 53 percent - the worst in 29 polls since he took office in January 2009. Only 43 percent approved of his job performance. The disapproval number was up sharply from the 47 percent reading in September and tops the previous high of 52 percent in September 2011.\n\nObama retained strong support among Democrats - 77 percent to 18 percent approval - and disdain from Republicans - 90 percent to 8 percent disapproval. Independents disapproved 56 percent to 41 percent.\n\nObama's personal ratings were also down, with more people having an unfavorable impression of him, 52 percent to 46 percent. It was the first time since November 2011 the negative number was higher, and the worst he has endured.\n\n## Website Failure And Stagnant Economy\n\nObama in recent weeks has been battered by controversy over his health care program. The highly touted website where people could sign up for coverage proved to be a dysfunctional embarrassment. Obama had to backtrack from his assertion that people could keep their plans if they wanted.\n\nCongress fared even worse in the survey, with voters not approving of the Republicans performance, 74 percent to 22 percent - the highest since the question was first asked in April 2011. Republicans control the House of Representatives and 45 of the Senate's 100 seats.\n\nPeople soured on Democrats, too, with 64 percent disapproving of congressional Democrats, who control the Senate. Both Republican and Democratic disapproval numbers were up sharply from the last poll in July.\n\nThe key reason for the glum ratings is the economy. Though indicators suggest a healthy comeback, people aren't feeling it. Instead, said Miringoff, the two Washington stories that have dominated headlines in recent months were the 16-day October government shutdown and the health care chaos.\n\nAs a result, two-thirds saw things going in the wrong direction and only 30 percent felt matters were heading in the right direction.\n\n## Democrats And Republicans Play The Blame Game\n\nDemocrats felt better about the direction of the country, 57 percent to 40 percent. Republicans overwhelmingly saw the country moving the wrong way - 95 percent to 4 percent, while independents agreed, 69 percent to 26 percent.\n\nThe federal budget drama is the most obvious symbol of Washington inaction. Lawmakers have wrangled all year, passing stopgaps after extended, often bitter debate. Negotiators this week are said to be close on a deal that will avoid another shutdown when money again runs out Jan. 15.\n\nObama got low marks for his handling of the economy, with 58 percent disapproving of how he's dealing with it.\n\nRepublicans were blamed by 48 percent for the budget mess, while 38 percent named Obama.\n\n## Doubts About Iran Pact\n\nObama also suffered in foreign policy.\n\nThe latest poll was conducted after the administration announced a pact with Iran that eases some punishments on that country. In return, Iran agreed to some limits on its nuclear program.\n\nThat plan has won little congressional support, as lawmakers from both parties expressed doubts. Forty-six percent approved of Obama's handling of foreign policy, while 51 percent did not.\n\nVoters have mixed views about how all this will translate in next year's elections. Equal numbers - 43 percent - said they would vote for a Republican or a Democratic candidate. Independents preferred Republicans, 41 percent to 34 percent, while moderates favored Democrats, 49 percent to 35 percent.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - President Barack Obama canceled his trip to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow next month, the White House said Wednesday. Russia has granted national security leaker Edward Snowden the right to stay in the country, while the U.S. wants him to return to face American charges.\n\nThe decision was not solely based on Snowden. The United States has grown frustrated with Russia on missile defense and arms control, trade and commercial relations, and human rights.\n\n\"We have reached the conclusion that there is not enough recent progress in our bilateral agenda with Russia to hold a U.S.-Russia Summit in early September,\" according to a statement released by White House press secretary Jay Carney. Summits are meetings between heads of states and are typically major events.\n\nCarney said the United States values cooperation on a variety of issues between the two nations. They include a new nuclear weapons treaty and cooperation on Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.\n\n## At Odds Over Syrian Civil War\n\nObama, who is traveling in California, said in an interview Tuesday that he was \"disappointed\" by Russia's move to grant Snowden asylum for one year. But he said the two nations still work together on Afghanistan and the investigation of the Boston Marathon bombing.\n\n\"There are times when they slip back into Cold War thinking and Cold War mentality,\" Obama said on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. \"What I continually say to them and to President Putin, 'that's the past.'\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with their Russian counterparts Friday in Washington to discuss the relationship.\n\nThe decision will only hurt an already uneasy relationship between Obama and Putin. The two remain at odds over the civil war in Syria. The United States also has been frustrated with Russia's decision to ban U.S. adoptions of Russian children, and with potential human rights violations. Obama also has criticized a new law in Russia that is seen as hostile to gays and lesbians.\n\nSnowden is accused of leaking information about the government's program of monitoring cellphone calls and Internet usage. He has been charged with espionage. He fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia. He was in the Moscow airport for more than a month before Russia granted him asylum last week.\n\n## Russia Dislikes Missile Shield\n\nMoscow has accused the United States of installing a missile shield in Eastern Europe as a way to block Russian influence.\n\nObama will attend the Group of 20 economic summit in St. Petersburg, but will no longer meet with Putin in Moscow in early September as he had planned. Instead, he will travel to Sweden. The G20 is a group of 19 big countries and the European Union.\n\nObama and Putin last met in June at the Group of 8 summit in Northern Ireland. The G8 is a smaller group of major countries. The United States has informed Russia that \"it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared agenda.\"\n\nThe decision to scrap the meeting dismayed experts on U.S.-Russia relations. They argue that it will do little to improve relations between the two superpowers.\n\n\"All this does is say 'You're not worth our time, we have better things,''' said Matthew Rojanksy, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute on Russia. \"In no sense does this encourage Russia to come back with a better offer.\"\n\n## Senator Calls Putin A Bully\n\nBut lawmakers have been angered with Russia's decision to grant Snowden temporary asylum. Both Republicans and Democrats applauded the move.\n\n\"This should help make it clear that the Russian government's giving Edward Snowden 'refugee' status is unacceptable,\" said House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the president made the right decision.\n\n\"President Putin is acting like a schoolyard bully and doesn't deserve the respect a bilateral summit would have accorded him,\" he said. Schumer had urged Obama to cancel the meeting.\n\nThe G-20 summit is scheduled to take place in St. Petersburg Sept. 5-6. Obama will make his first visit to Sweden before the summit.\n\n\"Sweden is a close friend and partner to the United States,\" Carney said. He said the country plays a leading role on trade and the environment.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., upset both athletes and Olympic officials on Wednesday when he suggested that the United States should consider boycotting - that is, pulling out of in protest - the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.\n\n\"I love the Olympics, but I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world,\" Graham told NBC News.\n\nKevin Bishop, Graham's communications director, said the senator was referring to a number of things. Such as Russia's political and military support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad, who is opposed by the United States, is currently battling rebels attempting to overthrow him.\n\nAnd Russia is giving temporary asylum to former National Security Agency (NSA) employee Edward Snowden. He recently leaked details about the way the NSA has been secretly monitoring phone calls and computer messages in the U.S. and overseas. Snowden is being sought by the U.S. government.\n\n## U.S. Olympic Committee Opposes Idea\n\nBishop emphasized that Graham wasn't specifically calling for a boycott, but wanted to raise the idea. Bishop did not respond to a request for an interview with Graham.\n\nThe mere suggestion of a boycott was enough for the U.S. Olympic Committee to release a statement that said members \"strongly oppose\" the idea. Comparisons were drawn with the 1980 Olympic boycott, in which the United States and 64 other nations refused to send athletes to Moscow.\n\nAt the time, tensions were very high between the United States and the Soviet Union (as Russia was then known). The two superpowers and their allies were still caught up in the Cold War - so-called because the United States and the Soviet Union were competing with each other, but not actually fighting.\n\n\"Our boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games did not contribute to a successful resolution of the underlying conflict,\" said Patrick Sandusky, U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman. \"It did, however, deprive hundreds of American athletes, all of whom had completely dedicated themselves to representing our nation at the Olympic Games, of the opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\nThe committee makes the final decision on whether to send athletes to the Olympics.\n\n## Athletes Who Missed The Games\n\nBack in 1980 one of those athletes was Ron Neugent, a member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team. Neugent, now an orthodontist in Wichita, Kan., had taken a year off from the University of Kansas to focus on his training. He lost out on his chance, however, when President Jimmy Carter declared that the United States would not send a team to Moscow, to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\"I'm an American. I understand that our country has to do some things for leverage around the world,\" Neugent said in an interview Wednesday. \"But I am also a human being, and as an athlete, you have a very short window to try and take part in the Olympic Games.\"\n\nDespite training for the 1984 games in Los Angeles, Neugent couldn't qualify, and he lost his chance to compete for his country. As it happened, the Soviet Union and its allies boycotted the Olympics that year, as a protest against the 1980 boycott.\n\nRenaldo Nehemiah found himself in a situation similar to Neugent's. The world-record holder in the 110-meter hurdles, he stayed home with the U.S. Olympic track and field team in 1980. He was never able to reach the games after that.\n\n\"Punishing athletes because the government can't resolve their issues isn't right,\" he said in an email. \"Sports have nothing to do with politics.\"\n\n## Olympic Boycotts Don't Work\n\nPoliticians in Washington haven't shown strong support for Graham's suggestion. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, as well as Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., told reporters Wednesday they disagreed with Graham.\n\nDuring the daily White House news briefing, press secretary Jay Carney repeatedly declined to comment on the possibility of a boycott. Sochi was a topic last Friday during a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. However, the press release summarizing the call mentioned only that both countries were cooperating on security for the games.\n\nRobert Edelman, a professor of Russian history and the history of sport at the University of California, San Diego, pointed out that the 1980 boycott failed to sway Soviet foreign policy. Indeed, the Soviet Union remained in Afghanistan until 1989.\n\n\"Jimmy Carter and his administration were very, very naive in the way that they understood [how] international sports works,\" he said Wednesday. \"We know that when the Soviets were making the decision to move in [to Afghanistan], the question of whether the Olympics would be boycotted or not was simply not discussed.\"\n\nAnd while the United States may currently have some substantial disagreements with Russia over foreign policy, he said, their relationship and Russia's conduct are nothing like they were during the Cold War. A 2014 boycott would make Carter's decision seem wise by comparison, Edelman said.\n\n\"Certainly the tendency of Putin since his re-election has been - I guess you could call it regressive and more nationalistic,\" he said. \"But the idea ... that it is equivalent either to what the Soviet government was like, or especially what [dictator Joseph] Stalin was like, is absurd.\"'"

            "text": "\tBOSTON, Mass. - The deadly attacks in Paris, France left schools and parents around the world with a difficult task. They needed to know what to say to children, and how to say it.\n\nMany teachers were not sure whether to discuss what happened in Paris on Friday night with their classes. Also, parents wondered whether to talk about the violence or how to explain it. From country to country, the topic was tackled in different, and similar, ways.\n\nMany schools held moments of silence to honor the hundreds of people who were killed or injured by gunmen during attacks at a half-dozen sites in Paris. The sites included restaurants, a concert hall and a soccer stadium. Some schools held open discussions about terrorism and the Paris attacks. Many teachers of younger children tried to shield them from the topic.\n\nAt Miami's George Washington Carver Middle School, teacher Sindy Garcia started her eighth-grade social studies class with a moment of silence. She then showed a video designed to teach students about the attacks. During a discussion afterward, some in the class asked what ISIS stands for and why the group wanted to attack France. The Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n## Teachers Take Cautious Approach\n\nThe group is trying to set up its own country governed by Islamic law. It has captured parts of Iraq and Syria. The extremists are also called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\n\"I tried to give them just enough facts that they're informed but not enough to overwhelm them,\" said Garcia. She is head of the school's social studies department. \"They'll know the number of deaths they'll know the number of injured, but I won't show more than that.\"\n\nAt the Lycee Fran\\xc3\\xa7ais de New York, students were called into assemblies by grade. There, they could discuss the news and their reactions.\n\n\"We took a really careful approach,\" said Elisabeth King, a spokeswoman for the French-language school in New York City. \"It's really about listening and alleviating fear.\"\n\n## French Newspaper Prints Children's Edition\n\nIn Paris, schools reopened Monday with normal routines. In one public school, a teacher drew a classroom of 7-year-old children to a corner, had them sit close together on the floor and explained there were attackers at a stadium. The teacher said there were more and more police coming every minute to protect people.\n\nA French newspaper, Liberation, published a special children's edition Monday.\n\nAt Downtown Magnets High School in Los Angeles, social studies teacher Daniel Jocz dropped his lesson plan to discuss the attacks. He asked his 11th grade students if they had any questions. Then, he went on to teach them the basics of the history and politics of the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n\"I want them to have a clear picture of the complexity,\" he said. \"And I realize it's a daunting task because many of them have not had any historical background.\"\n\nIn Toronto, the school district issued guidelines Monday to help teachers and parents talk about the attacks with children. Tips included addressing students' concerns about the events and asking questions about their feelings.\n\n## Kids Should Share Thoughts, Educator Says\n\n\"It is normal for people to try to make sense of things when a serious loss occurs. Allow your child to share his or her ideas and speculations,\" Donna Quan, director of education, said in the guidelines. \"Help them to separate what they know from what they are guessing about.\"\n\nExperts say parents should avoid talking about the attacks with children younger than 6. For older children, parents should invite them to watch the news as a family and then discuss it, said Dr. Steven Berkowitz, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania. He studies how children and teens think and behave.\n\n\"For a lot of kids this is part and parcel of the world they've grown up in,\" he said. \"Often, kids may have less of a reaction to these events than we do as adults, and sometimes we're surprised by that, and we shouldn't be.\"\n\nBerkowitz said parents should be careful to avoid passing their own anxiety on to their children.\n\n\"A lot of adults are pretty overwhelmed and scared by this, and they have to be aware of their own feelings,\" he said. It's important that adults \"get support from somebody else and not put it onto the kids,\" Berkowitz said.\n\n## Some U.S. Schools Cancel Trips To D.C.\n\nIn the United States, each school decides on its own how to respond to the news. Hartford, Connecticut, distributed suggestions from the National Association of School Psychologists to principals on how to help children cope with terrorism.\n\nSome schools canceled or postponed trips to Washington, D.C., for fear of similar attacks.\n\nIn other countries, government officials may decide how schools should handle the subject. In Italy, the minister of education asked schools and universities to devote a minute of silence and at least an hour of reflection to the attacks.\n\nMinister Stefania Giannini said that educators must help students \"reject, today more than ever, any temptation toward xenophobia or racism.\" Xenophobia is the hatred and fear of people from other countries.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama on Monday called on Americans to stand up against religious hatred, as he offered his support to the families of those killed in an apparent hate crime.\n\nOn Sunday, three people were killed at two Jewish community centers in the Kansas City area.\n\n\"Nobody should have to worry about their security when gathering with their fellow believers,\" Obama told religious leaders at the White House for the annual Easter prayer breakfast. \"No one should ever have to fear for their safety when they go to pray. And as a government, we're going to provide whatever assistance is needed to support the investigation.\"\n\nObama noted that he had a connection to two of the victims. A teenager and his grandfather were shot in a parking lot behind the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. Both were Christian. They attended the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, Obama said.\n\nThat church's pastor, Rev. Adam Hamilton, delivered the sermon at the prayer service at the National Cathedral marking Obama's second inauguration and attended last year's prayer breakfast at the White House. Hamilton broke the news to his church members at the Palm Sunday service, the president said.\n\n## \"Keep Coming Together\"\n\nObama noted that the killings happened as Jews were preparing to celebrate Passover, the holiday that marks the freedom of the Jewish people from slavery in Egypt 3,300 years ago. The killings also came as Christians were observing Palm Sunday, which celebrates the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem. That the killings happened at the time of these religious celebrations \"makes this tragedy all the more painful,\" Obama said.\n\nPolice have arrested Frazier Glenn Miller, 73, in connection with the shooting. Civil rights supporters say Miller has ties to the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that promotes white supremacy. Miller has a long history of promoting hate against Jews, among others. Police say they do not believe that the shooter knew his three victims.\n\nObama called on the religious leaders to \"keep coming together across faiths to combat the ignorance and intolerance, including anti-Semitism.\" Anti-Semitism is prejudice against Jews, which Obama said \"can lead to hatred and to violence.\"\n\n\"This Easter week, of course, we recognize that there's a lot of pain and a lot of sin and a lot of tragedy in this world,\" he said. \"But we're also overwhelmed by the grace of an awesome God.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We're all children of God, we're all made in his image, all worthy of his love and dignity, and we see what happens around the world when this kind of religious-based or -tinged violence can rear its ugly head. It's got no place in our society.\"\n\n## Visit To Vatican\n\nObama mentioned his recent trip to Vatican City, the center for the Catholic faith located in Rome, Italy. There he met for the first time with Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church. Obama, who is not Catholic, has said he is inspired by the pope and praised his focus on inequality and inclusion in the church.\n\nThe president urged the religious leaders to mind the message coming out of Rome.\n\nThe [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) tells people to see the \"dignity in each human being,\" Obama said. But Obama said it's also his deeds that people should follow. The pope is known for \"hugging the homeless man or washing the feet of somebody who, normally, ordinary folks would just pass by on the street.\"\n\nObama said the pope reminds us that we \"no matter what our station, have an obligation to live righteously and that we all have an obligation to live humbly.\" That, Obama said, is the example that religion teaches us to follow.'"

            "title": "California governor says no more Redskins name in high schools",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Four California high schools will have two years to pick a new school mascot. All of the schools currently identify their sports teams as the Redskins, but now that name is banned in California. Governor Jerry Brown recently signed legislation that makes the state the first in the country to bar public schools from using the Redskins name for their sports teams.\n\nThe mascot legislation, unique to California, will prevent public schools from using a word that many Native Americans regard as insulting. The word dates back to 1699, and is listed in the Merriam Webster dictionary as a \"usually offensive\" term for a Native American.\n\n## All Schools Do Not Support The Ban\n\nIn California, only four public schools still use the name Redskins, and Tulare Union High is one. Sarah Koligian, the superintendent of Tulare Joint Union High School District, said officials were disappointed by Brown's decision. However, she added, they will change the name of their sports teams.\n\n\"We will adhere to the law as it is written. Together with our Board of Trustees, school community and our Tulare community we will seek their input to determine our new mascot,\" Koligian said.\n\nThe Chowchilla Union High School District also uses the mascot. They plan to ask the public to help come up with a new name. The superintendent there, Ronald V. Seals, said Chowchilla has used a Redskins mascot and logo since 1928 without complaints. \"You don't pick a mascot that you don't respect, dignify, love, honor, all those things,\" he said. \"It's just taking away something that's so near and dear to their hearts ... and by people who don't even live here.\"\n\nTwo other schools, Gustine High in Merced County, and Calaveras High in Calaveras County, California, are also known as the Redskins. They too, will now have to come up with a new name and mascot.\n\n## Washington Redskins Fighting Name Change\n\nA National Football League (NFL) team has been facing similar pressure to change its name. Native American groups are protesting the continued use of the Redskins name in their court battle with the Washington Redskins. The NFL team, based in Washington, D.C., faces fierce opposition from the groups who consider its name to be a racial insult.\n\nLast year, a federal court panel ruled that the Washington Redskins will lose the trademark on its name, and this year a federal judge upheld that decision. The team is fighting the decision in an appeals court.\n\nOneida Native American Ray Halbritter is a member of a group called Change The Mascot. He sees a clear connection between the California mascot ban and the NFL Washington Redskins battle.\n\n\"This landmark legislation eliminating the R-word in California schools clearly demonstrates that this issue is not going away, and that opposition to the Washington team on this issue is only intensifying. The NFL should act immediately to press the team to change the name,\" Halbritter said.\n\n## Smokeless Tobacco Is Out Too\n\nIn addition to the ban on the Redskins name, the California governor signed two other sports-related bills into law. One measure bans players and coaches from using smokeless tobacco at professional baseball parks. The other recognizes competitive cheerleading as a high school sport.\n\nThe smokeless tobacco measure bars players and coaches from having the product on the playing field at all California professional ballparks.\n\nSmokeless tobacco is a form of cured tobacco. The two main types most commonly available in the United States are chewing tobacco and moist snuff. Both are used by placing the tobacco between the cheek or lip, and the gum.\n\nMajor League Baseball, whose teams use the parks, said it supported banning smokeless tobacco when the proposal was introduced earlier this year. Smokeless tobacco is already prohibited in minor leagues.\n\nPublic health officials who support the proposal say that more young people are using smokeless tobacco, even while cigarette use drops. They say smokeless tobacco still contributes to oral, pancreatic and esophageal cancers, as well as other diseases.\n\nIn California, the smokeless tobacco law expands on local bans already in place in San Francisco and Los Angeles. It is not yet clear how the statewide ban will be enforced.\n\n## Cheerleaders Get Recognition\n\nThe governor also approved a bill last week that requires the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) to oversee competitive cheerleading as an official sport by the 2018 school year. The CIF is the governing body for high school athletics in California, and already oversees many other high school sports.\n\nCompetitive cheerleading is when cheer squads compete against each other. Teams perform routines with music that include stunts, jumps and tumbling.\n\n\"The formal recognition will give cheerleading the respect and safety standards that athletes deserve,\" Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez of San Diego said. She introduced the bill. Gonzalez is a former high school and college cheerleader, and said at least eight other states already treat competitive cheerleading as a sport.\n\nThe two laws regarding the mascot ban and the inclusion of competitive cheerleading will both take effect in 2017. The smokeless tobacco ban at professional ballparks goes into effect before next season.'"

            "text": "\tIt was a steamy August morning, a day when you can't stop imagining how good a mouthful of ice would feel.\n\nIce was part of Aja Evans' midsummer day's dream too. Evans was thinking about how good it would feel to be back on it, how the success from her rookie season as a bobsled pusher still sent chills of excitement through her.\n\nSo Evans, in trying to reach her dream of reaching the Olympics, had slogged her way through traffic from her mother's house to the training center. It was one stop on her path to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nEvans, 25, went into the gym to begin a workout with her trainer, Jacob Ross. She was wearing a purple top, black tights, pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces, and a smile that flashed brightly on her face, at least when it was not contorted by effort.\n\n## \"Cool Runnings\"\n\nIn this session, there would be sets of box squats, in which she eventually lifted 365 pounds; sets of dead lifts up to 195 pounds; and crouching carries of a 40-pound SandBell, a weight that looks sort of like an accordion. She also would repeat flips of a 400-pound tire; and, most eye-catching of all, box jumps.\n\nBox jumps involve springing forward from a seated position to a stack of pads about 2 feet in front of the seat. Evans launched her 5-foot-10, 175-pound body to the top of a 4-foot, 3-inch high stack.\n\nSports success is in her family's DNA. Her father, Fred, was an NAIA swimming champion for Chicago State - the first black swimmer to win a national title for college athletes. Her uncle is longtime Major League Baseball player Gary Matthews and her cousin Gary Matthews Jr. has played baseball in the major leagues for 12 years.\n\n\"But no one grows up bobsledding in their backyard,\" Ross said. Evans' introduction to bobsledding was even more unlikely considering she's from the south and west sides of Chicago.\n\nLike many people, Aja Evans' knowledge of bobsledding had consisted of what she saw in the film \"Cool Runnings.\" The movie tells the story about even more unlikely bobsledders, from Jamaica.\n\nShe learned more about bobsledding during the 2010 Winter Olympics. Her University of Illinois track coach, Mike Erb, decided to compare Evans' scores in sprinting, jumping and power to those used to test the bobsled athletes. Erb realized her combination of skills was ideal for a sled pusher and encouraged her to try the sport.\n\n## Noise, Bumps And Shaking\n\nAn online search told her about bobsled tests in the summer of 2012. She went, got the highest score (794 of 800), then stunned everyone by winning the dry-land push trials.\n\nThree months after the combine tests, Evans found herself on ice at the Olympic bobsled track in Lake Placid, New York. She was about to plunge into the unknown: sitting in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds at speeds beyond 70 miles per hour.\n\nBonny Warner, who has been in the Olympics three times on another kind of sled, the luge, once said, \"The ground shakes when a bobsled goes by.\" She described steering it as akin to trying to maneuver an overloaded Mack truck. The bobsleds, she said, \"sound like a locomotive in a tunnel and are as smooth and graceful as a drunken elephant.\"\n\nExperienced bobsledders tried to prepare Evans for what her first run would be like - the noise, the bumps, the shaking, the G-force in the curves. It was even worse than they said, and Evans initially wondered what she was doing there.\n\nWith the encouragement of her mother, Sequocoria Mallory, Evans decided that if she made it through that second run, she would stick with it. The whole way down, she was thinking, \"It's worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it.\"\n\nTwo days later, in the second of four runs of the national team trials for the 2012-13 season, Evans and driver Jamie Greubel set a start record for the Lake Placid track. \"I don't know what I'm doing,\" Evans said to herself, \"but I'm doing pretty good.\"\n\n## Rookie Of The Year\n\nBy the end of the season, she would be USA Bobsled's rookie of the year, win two World Cup medals and set start records on tracks in Park City, Utah; Koenigsee, Germany; and the 2014 Olympic venue in Sochi, where she and the top U.S. driver, Elana Meyers, also would win a World Cup silver medal.\n\nThe push phase of a bobsled race lasts 50 meters of a track that is about 30 times that long. The driver and pusher, also known as pilot and brakeman, push for 20 or 30 meters, then jump into the sled. The pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off the line the driver is steering.\n\nThe silver medal Evans won in February in her last competition of the season in Sochi was special, and still made her eyes misty when she recounted it six months later. It is also what convinced Meyers that her brakeman was willing to fight through any adversity in the sport.\n\nEvans' grandfather and constant supporter, Lemorse Mallory, died at 95, six days before the race, and she wanted to be back with her family in Chicago. Evans' mother persuaded her to stay, that her grandfather would have wanted her to compete.\n\n\"Battling all those emotions and doing as well as I did made me so much more excited to return this season,\" Evans said. \"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part, and now it's a victory lap.\"'"

            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia - At an International Olympic Committee (IOC) briefing last week, the world's sports journalists witnessed an odd pairing that said a lot about the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.\n\nSage Kotsenburg, the gold-medal-winning American snowboard dude in sweatsuit and knit cap, was sharing a podium with the suave, nattily dressed Swiss man, Christophe Dubi. He is the IOC's director of sports.\n\nThe pairing was indicative of the wildly successful union of what once were polar-opposite institutions: the stodgy, European-dominated IOC and the rebellious, U.S. extreme-sport community.\n\nThe marriage has been beneficial to both. While the Olympics provide snowboarders and freestyle skiers with an international showcase, the new sports have added youthful energy and millions of new TV viewers to Games that were growing stale.\n\n## \"Young And Cool\"\n\n\"The Olympics are the highest level of competition you can get,\" said Gus Kenworthy, a silver medalist in slopestyle skiing. \"Our sport is young and cool and has a following all its own. It's breathing new life into the Olympics. It's a cool dynamic.\"\n\nThe Winter Games, as founder Baron de Coubertin conceived them and broadcast pioneer Roone Arledge presented them for so long, have been changed dramatically by the inclusion of these sports.\n\nLoud rock music, an edgy venue announcer, rebellious attitudes - all are indicative of the changes. So is a younger TV audience that once spurned the Games.\n\nIn the crucial U.S. market, the most widely viewed segment of NBC's coverage of the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada, was Shaun White's winning the half-pipe.\n\nAnd so far in 2014, though they still have a week to run, the same is true at the Sochi Games. Twenty-four million Americans watched White finish fourth in the tape-delayed event Wednesday.\n\nThe youth movement couldn't have arrived at a better time. Figure skating, long the Winter Olympics' signature event and the sport that drove its TV ratings, has experienced a sharp decline.\n\nEver since the first Winter Games in 1924, figure skating's female gold-medal winners have been the Olympics' most popular stars. The first winner was teenage Norwegian skater Sonja Henie.\n\nBut for reasons that range from the sport's arcane scoring system to its often overly formal tone, that's no longer true.\n\nIn 1988, when Katarina Witt battled American Debi Thomas at Calgary, the women's free-skate finale attracted an astounding 46 rating. Four years ago in Vancouver, the same event scored a 13.6.\n\n## Capturing A New Audience\n\nMeanwhile, for decades, the IOC resisted any major changes. Sports such as snowboarding, with their rebellious image, weren't even on its radar.\n\n\"Snowboarding was looked at as the rebel sport,\" said White, the half-pipe gold medalist in its first two Olympic appearances. \"It wasn't fit to be on the mountain. We were outcasts.\"\n\nFinally, in a burst of revised thinking between 1992 and 2010, the IOC added short-track speedskating and freestyle-skiing and snowboarding disciplines.\n\nAt Sochi there will be more days with either freestyle skiing or snowboarding than with figure skating.\n\n\"There definitely was a lot of skepticism at first,\" said Luke Bodensteiner, an executive vice president of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association and an early proponent of the new sports. \"People always have concerns that by adding new sports you'll drain resources and participants from the existing ones.\"\n\nBodensteiner gave much of the credit for the IOC's awakening to Dubi, the 44-year-old son of an Olympic hockey player who, as the organization's director of sports, has pushed it in a new direction.\n\nFor his part, Dubi said he wasn't trying to injure or eliminate any existing sports by lobbying for the changes.\n\n\"We need to preserve our history. It's very important,\" he said. \"At the same time, we have to remain relevant and make sure that we capture a new audience as well.\"\n\n## Slopestyle's Blaring Music\n\nNo sport better typifies this new Winter Games than slopestyle. In all its forms - men's and women's, skiing and snowboarding - it's by far been the most discussed, and, for Americans at least, the most successful of the 12 first-time sports here.\n\n\"I think the world needed to see slopestyle,\" said Kotsenburg, who won the snowboarding event. \"Snowboarding is different from figure skating or gymnastics. This is what the kids are doing nowadays.\"\n\nThe international skiing community finally noticed that midway through the last decade, when it saw slopestyle's growth and potential. When the IOC convened to add or drop sports for 2014, its 300 members got a primer.\n\n\"They had little understanding of the sport,\" recalled Bodensteiner, \"but we showed them how visually appealing it was and, maybe more importantly, how it could be picked up even in nations like Great Britain or Australia that don't have big mountains or big resorts.\"\n\nWhile skaters increasingly are bound by a scoring system that demands they perform a fixed set of elements, slopestylers are free to experiment.\n\nAnd while figure skating's atmosphere often resembles that of classical music's, a slopestyle event, even at the Olympics, includes blaring music, a hip P.A. announcer, and lots of video screens.\n\nNBC's Olympics chief, Jim Bell, said the athletes were as significant as the events in the new sports' appeal.\n\n\"They're not some robotic athlete,\" Bell said. \"They've got personality. They've got spark.\"\n\nWhen Kotsenburg won his gold medal, the audience at the 10 a.m. event overflowed Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. Among the crowd were Dubi and several other IOC officials, hardly the typical demographic.\n\n\"We really had goose bumps,\" Dubi said of watching Kotsenburg soar. \"I don't know how it was for you in the media, but for us, we thought it was the ultimate experience.\"'"

            "text": "\tBALTIMORE - You start with a little girl, dropped in an orphanage and afflicted with a spinal condition that has paralyzed her below the belly button. She's cared for, yes, but as she scoots around the facility on her hands, no one seeing her can imagine a future ripe with possibility.\n\nHow do you get from there to a 24-year-old woman nicknamed \"The Beast,\" a fearsomely muscled athlete who believes her body can fulfill the most outlandish ambitions her mind conceives?\n\nGiven her biography, the latest story starring Tatyana McFadden, of Clarksville, Md., is almost too rich.\n\nStarting Friday, she'll compete in at least three events at the Sochi Winter Paralympics, a brand-new arena for an athlete who has already conquered the Summer Paralympics and the wheelchair marathon circuit. She'll take on the best in the world after just 50 days training on snow, a daunting challenge but one that exhilarates her.\n\nShe'll do so in Russia, the very country where, in that orphanage, her horizons once seemed so limited. And she'll perform in front of her birth mother and the director of her former orphanage.\n\n## Wins Four Major Marathons\n\nThe changes in McFadden amazed staffers at Orphanage 13 in St. Petersburg, who met her during a return visit in 2011. She was adopted by an American woman years ago.\n\n\"I was the first person with a disability to come back, and they were absolutely amazed - from scrawny to how strong I've become,\" McFadden says. \"It amazed them, because they've never seen someone with a disability become so successful and so independent.\"\n\n\"Very few women in the world are as fit as she is or can generate the power that she does, no matter what the sport,\" says her track coach, Adam Bleakney.\n\nAll of her previous achievements merely set the stage for 2013, when McFadden became the first person to win four major marathons - Boston, London, Chicago and New York - in the same calendar year. And those victories were sandwiched around a world championship performance in which she won every race between 100 and 5,000 meters.\n\nEven as her remarkable 2013 unfolded, McFadden had her eye on the next hurdle - winter.\n\nMcFadden had hatched her plan to try cross-country skiing - known as sit skiing in the Paralympics.\n\nWhether she would put it this way or not, McFadden seems to thrive on attempting feats that sound impossible to most.\n\n\"I guess I do,\" she says. \"My mom was like, 'Why do you want to do a winter sport? You've always been a summer athlete.' It's a new challenge and it's fun. Yeah, it's crazy to deal with the changes. But it's also fun.\"\n\n## Seeking The Next Challenge\n\n\"What can I do next?\" she says, describing her ethos. \"I think that's the fun part.\"\n\nMcFadden brought up the cross-country idea with coaches from the U.S. Paralympic team. They agreed she'd be perfect for the sport because of her upper-body power and cardiovascular endurance.\n\nBut the shift from champion marathoner to Olympics-ready skier wasn't instant, McFadden says. Though her strength made her competitive, the ideal skiing motion requires harmony between the upper body and the core muscles. That's hard for McFadden because of the extent of her paralysis.\n\n\"The endurance, strength and power she has earned on the track and in her training are her greatest assets in Nordic skiing,\" says her winter coach, John Farra. \"But otherwise, skiing is very different from track.\"\n\nOn snow McFadden isn't yet the powerful force she is on the track or a marathon course. A top-10 finish is a good result for her at the world-class level, with her best chances for victory coming at the shorter distances.\n\n\"She is still very new in the sport,\" Farra says. \"But I would not count her out in any event she enters. They don't make them much tougher than this one.\"\n\nThough McFadden is focused on Sochi as an athletic competition, there's little question the games will carry an extra layer of emotion because of her Russian background.\n\nAfter she won the London Marathon in 2011, she decided to visit St. Petersburg before returning to the U.S.\n\n## Thanking Her Birth Mother\n\nMcFadden went back to Orphanage 13, taking in the modest space that had seemed so huge to her when she was a tiny kid, navigating the halls on her hands.\n\nAfter touring the orphanage, she met her birth mother.\n\nSome articles describe McFadden as having been \"abandoned\" in the orphanage, but she doesn't regard the experience that way. Her birth mother, Nina Polivikova, was young and had no means to care for a baby with spina bifida. She had been told her child would die, that there was no hope for her.\n\n\"My birth mom, she had to do the hardest part,\" McFadden says. \"Just to give me life and then put me in the orphanage, because I was extremely sick.\"\n\nShe wanted their reunion to be free of feelings of guilt.\n\n\"Going back and showing her the person I've become was almost a way of saying thank you to her,\" she says. \"I wanted her to know, 'It's not your fault. You did what you could. You did the best that you could at that time and moment.'\"\n\nShe has remained in touch with Polivikova since their meeting and looks forward to racing in front of her and various cousins in Sochi.\n\n\"That's the first time they get to physically see me compete,\" McFadden says. \"For me, that's going to be fulfilling. I'm sure I'll never forget being able to see them at the starting line or being there when I cross.\"'"

            "text": "\tHACKENSACK, N.J. - When Mohammad Abdelhamid was 3 years old, he told his mother that he was going to be a basketball player and buy a mansion.\n\nHis mother, Azza Abdelziz, took his ambitions seriously and raised him to be an athlete. Now a high school student, he plays three sports at Fort Lee High School - soccer, basketball and baseball. Mohammad also plays for a private soccer club that travels around the region.\n\nAbdelziz cheered for her son on a recent Sunday as she watched him take on another high school team in a basketball tournament. Also in the stands were relatives, friends and college recruiters taking in the action as the warm bodies on the court pushed up the temperature in the gym.\n\nBut Abdelziz deserved as much praise from her son as she heaped on him.\n\n## Huge Sacrifices for Sports\n\nShe and other parents in the crowd have made tremendous sacrifices to help their children pursue their dreams of an athletic career. Abdelziz said that over the past 10 years, she has hosted relatives at her house less and less because of her son's game and practice schedule. She also stuck with her job as a school bus driver rather than find another one, because the hours are better for high school sports.\n\nJocelyn Picache, the mother of another Fort Lee player, said basketball is not even the most demanding of youth sports. She estimated her family spent upward of $100,000 transporting her eldest daughter around the country for gymnastics competitions from the time the girl was 6 until she was 13. Her daughter, who was a prospect for the U.S. Olympic team, had to give up the sport after a serious back injury.\n\n\"We could have made a down payment on a house\" with the money, Picache said.\n\n## For Parents, It's All Worth It\n\nIn talking about their sacrifices, though, parents were full of pride, not bitterness.\n\nHoward Breindel, the father of a player for Tenafly High School, said making sacrifices for your children is what parenting is all about.\n\n\"You have kids so you can support them through these years,\" he said, \"because after that they're gone.\"\n\nPlus, he said, by participating in sports, young athletes learn essential life lessons such as  discipline, teamwork, respect, sportsmanship and focus. Over and over, parents watching the tournament said sports will help their boys succeed in the classroom and in life.\n\nThen there is the lure of playing ball in college. Kevin Goodson, whose son plays for Jersey City's Henry Snyder High School, said that playing basketball in college was a dream for everyone on his son's team.\n\nBreindel speculated that by the time kids get to high school and see all the talented athletes out there, they become more realistic about their chances of playing at the next level. That is fine with Breindel, he said, because there is so much else to do. Breindel's son, for example, has been accepted into college to write movie screenplays.\n\n## Tough Odds, But Still Enjoyable\n\nAccording to 2013 estimates from the NCAA, a mere 3.3 percent of high school men's basketball players compete at the college level. For soccer, that percentage is 5.7 percent of high school players, 6.5 percent for football, 6.8 percent for baseball and 3.7 percent for women's basketball.\n\nOnly 0.03 percent of high school men's basketball players make it as a pro.\n\nWhile high school sports last, Abdelziz and Picache are going to enjoy it to the fullest. The two women live on different floors in the same apartment building, but they see each other most often at their sons' sporting events.\n\n\"All these kids are like my kids,\" Abdelziz said as she cheered alongside Picache. She said she especially enjoyed road trips for away games when all the players and family members go out to dinner together and stay at the same hotel.\n\nFor Picache, attending her son's games helps her relax after a long day of work.\n\n\"Once I go to the game, it takes the pressure off,\" she said. \"I forget about everything.\"'"

            "text": "\tST. LOUIS - Eric Lay and other trainers are more concerned about whether student athletes can do a decent pushup than throw a fastball.\n\nCan they do leg lunges without flailing their arms, wobbling or falling to one side? Are they able to touch their toes? Pull up to their chin? Can they shuttle back and forth?\n\nIn a nutshell, trainers want to know whether these kids really know how to properly and safely move, and later, can they add strength to those movements?\n\nIt's all part of a growing push among trainers and others in fitness fields to get schools, parents, coaches and kids back to basics with physical fitness. Instead of focusing primarily on organized youth sports, they want kids to acquire proper movement skills beginning as early as kindergarten.\n\n## An Alphabet Building Block\n\nIf it sounds like a throwback to gym class, it is. Those movements first emphasized in gym - skipping, lunging, twisting, jumping, stopping and starting - are the building blocks of high-performing athletes. They are also the key to enjoying all sorts of activities that encourage lifelong fitness, said Larry Meadors, a former national high school strength and conditioning coach with the National Association of Strength and Fitness.\n\nBut \"for some ungodly reason we've skipped teaching fundamental movement,\" Meadors said.\n\n\"We all learned the alphabet,\" he said. \"And as we learned the alphabet we learned how to put two letters (together) and then three and then four to form words, and pretty soon we had a word, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, a book. And you should apply the same things for athletics.\"\n\nYouth athletics has become a huge business with many well-meaning but poorly trained coaches. But in an age where kids have seemingly endless opportunities to play sports outside of school, good movement is not always something Lay sees. That particularly can be the case with specialized year-round, single sports, like soccer or baseball. Often he'll see unbalanced movement, from years of kicking with one leg in soccer or pitching and throwing on a softball or baseball team.\n\nThose physical fitness shortfalls can lead to injuries. That's because the kids do the same thing over and over again. And coaches and sports organizations may put too little emphasis on proper training beyond a few skills drills.\n\n\"Parents want their kids to be physically active, and sports is an option. So a lot of people think, if my kid is in a sport, that takes care of it,\" Lay said. Lay is the head trainer at Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, a private school in St. Louis. \"Sport skills are great, but there has to also be some training in fundamental movements.\"\n\n## Decline In Movement Skills\n\nMeadors is a retired educator who runs a conditioning program in the Burnsville, Minn., school district. He said he's seen a significant decline in movement skills in kids over the past decade. Meadors said he has 11th and 12th grade students with the same movement problems as 6-year-olds.\n\nPart of it is due to a decline in physical education in schools and a more inactive lifestyle. Yet kids also face problems in competitive youth sports, he said. In youth sports, they learn a limited set of movements important to the sport, but may lack other critical movement skills to help them fully succeed.\n\n\"A sports skill is only a sports skill, it's part of the game. But there is a ton of stuff the human body does above those skills that (fine tune) that performance,\" Meadors said.\n\nThe popularity of youth sports is exploding for very young children. There is increased competition, seemingly unlimited options to play and pressure to compete in a single sport, year-round, leading to a rapid increase in injuries even before middle school.\n\nMore than 3.5 million kids age 14 and younger are treated each year for sports injuries. And the numbers are increasing. More than half of all youth sports injuries can be prevented. In about half the cases, the injuries are often linked to the growing trend of children specializing in one sport and playing it year-round.\n\nInjuries in youth are the result of overall low strength levels, said Meadors in a paper. They also occur when children don't land correctly, when their muscles are too tight, their quadriceps muscles in their thighs are overdeveloped or they rely too much on a particular limb. These problems essentially are tied to poor conditioning and not knowing how to move properly.\n\nMany kids simply don't know how to correctly slow down and stop when running. Others can't land a jump properly, he said.\n\n## Few Get Conditioning Training\n\nMeadors has developed a list of appropriate of movements to learn from kindergarten through middle school.\n\nNationwide, though, few kids are getting formal conditioning training. A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows only 3.8 percent of elementary schools, 7.9 percent of middle schools and 2.1 percent of high schools nationwide provide daily gym classes.\n\nMeadors said movement problems and injuries are roadblocks to developing lifelong fitness. Research suggests that teen female athletes who suffered an injury in high school were more likely to have weight problems later in life, Lay said.\n\nAbout 70 percent of youth athletes drop out of sports by high school because of burnout. This all results in a couch potato lifestyle that contributes to [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity), diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\nMeadors said schools, parents, coaches and kids need to identify the big connection between proper movement skills, lifelong health and true athletic performance.\n\nIn the midst of intense game schedules, coaches have no time to learn proper conditioning or include it into limited practice schedules, he said.\n\n\"When we get to the point of 3.5 million kids injured in a given year - that's the fourth leading health risk by the World Health Organization. There's something wrong about that,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tRIO DE JANEIRO - Pope Francis waded into the heart of Brazil's troubles Thursday, telling residents of an often-violent slum that their leaders must do a better job of helping them.\n\nThe [pope's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) comments could be seen as provocative, but they were not out of character. The newly appointed spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics has two causes he holds dear: social justice and reaching out to the poor.\n\n\"I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources, to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice,\" the pope told a rain-soaked crowd in the Varginha favela, or slum.\n\n\"Never tire of working for a more just world, marked by greater solidarity,\" he said to enthusiastic applause. \"No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world.\"\\n## Brazil's Gaza Strip\n\nVarginha is a slum so poor and violent it is sometimes called the Gaza Strip, nicknamed after the conflict-prone region in the Middle East. The government has made small improvements in an effort to slow protests and riots. But the pope seemed to be saying that such efforts did not go far enough.\n\n\"Here, as in the whole of Brazil, there are many young people. You have a particular sensitivity towards injustice, but you are often disappointed by facts that speak of corruption on the part of people who put their own interests before the common good,\" the pope said at a recently renovated soccer field.\n\n\"To you and to all, I repeat: Never yield to discouragement, do not lose trust, do not allow your hope to be extinguished. Situations can change, people can change.\"\n\nIt was the most political message yet in the pope's pilgrimage to Brazil. Enormous protests erupted in the country last month among people angered by government corruption, excessive state spending on sports events and the lack of basic services such as education and health care.\n\nVenturing into the slum was probably the trickiest event in the pope's week in Brazil. The trip was his first overseas journey since his election in March, and one that has brought him to his native continent.\\n## Favela Spruced Up For Visit\n\nSecurity and transportation planning were complicated. The recently paved streets inside the favela are narrow; large parts of the slum are essentially in ruins, and the crowds, though perhaps admiring of the pope, are unpredictable. But the visit seemed to go off without any major problems.\n\n\"I'm so excited, I'm going to cry,\" Rosa dos Santos, one of the residents greeting the pope, told reporters.\n\n\"This is really important for us,\" said Milena de Souza, an office worker. \"He's a representative of humility and caring and most importantly, true peace, which is something we need here. Because of all the violence we've had here, hopefully, the pope can bless us.\"\n\nLess than 24 hours before the Argentine-born pope's scheduled arrival, the neighborhood of about 36,000 people was still getting cleaned up. Cement walls were being poured, and state workers were laying electrical cables. For days, military police have been out in full force, but drug traffickers' graffiti has kept reappearing.\n\n\"I am absolutely sure the only reason\" for the improvements \"is that the pope is coming,\" said Rita de Cassia.\n\nFrancis traveled to Varginha on Rio de Janeiro's northern edge in a modest silver car, not a limo, seated in the back and with the window rolled down. He then transferred to an open-sided \"popemobile\" from which he waved at followers who swarmed the vehicle. He kissed the occasional baby hoisted in his direction.\n\nGovernment sharpshooters lined the route.\\n## \"To Take A Cafezinho\"\n\nHundreds of residents and visiting pilgrims waited in cold, steady rain for the pope to arrive. Earlier in the day, he received the keys to the city and blessed some of Brazil's potential Olympic athletes.\n\nVarginha, built on old swampland, is one of several favelas that have been \"pacified.\" The drug lords who once ran the place have been ejected or subdued by authorities. The government has set aside money for community centers, libraries and a train station.\n\nBut residents say they have received more broken promises than actual help, and basic services like sanitation remain woefully unavailable. They also complain that police are heavy-handed and abusive, treating everyone like a criminal.\n\nAfter praying at the chapel, Francis entered a small, freshly painted home festooned with balloons in the Vatican colors of yellow and white. The Vatican, in Rome, is the papal headquarters.\n\nThe folksiness that has characterized the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was on display.\n\n\"From the start,\" the pope said, \"my wish in planning this visit to Brazil was to be able to visit every district throughout the nation. I would have liked to knock on every door, to say 'good morning,' to ask for a glass of cold water, to take a cafezinho, to speak as one would to family friends.\" Cafezinho is a strong Brazilian coffee traditionally served in a small cup.\n\nHe added, \"But Brazil is so vast! It is impossible to knock on every door.\"\n\nAnd so, he said, the favela would represent \"every district of Brazil.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES, Calif. - Real estate agent Ed Kaminsky has been calling anyone he might know who has an in with a Rams player or two.\n\nThe Los Angeles-area agent says he's been on the phone nonstop. \"I've been on the phone with the Rams' offices, sports agents, business managers, players, players that aren't on the team but that have relationships with players on the team,\" he said.\n\nKaminsky helps people buy and sell homes. Since the Rams' return to Los Angeles became official, he and other real estate agents have been hopping. They hope all the dialing will lead to return calls from the dozens of players, coaches and team officials who will be looking for a place to live.\n\nKaminsky is one of only a few agents in town who specialize in working with professional athletes. The agents help them find new places to live as they move from team to team. All are competing to get part of the bonanza that comes with the relocation of an entire NFL organization.\n\n## Agency Beefs Up Its Team\n\nThere are 53 players on a team. Add in coaches and assistant coaches and there will be more than 100 people looking for homes, said Kofi Nartey, an agent at The Agency, a Beverly Hills real estate company specializing in high-end properties. \"That's a lot of people looking for places.\"\n\nThe company will be adding employees just to work on moving the Rams. They will help players hire moving companies, have cars shipped across the country and research local schools, he said.\n\nNFL owners approved the move from St. Louis just last week. In anticipation of the newcomers, some agents started reaching out to their contacts months ago.\n\n\"Within the last six to eight months we've really revved up our conversations,\" said Ikem Chukumerije. He is the boss at Westside Premier Estates. \"It's all about relationships. If we don't have connections to a player but someone else does, they get the business.\"\n\n## Most Rams Players Will Rent\n\nThat business probably won't be worth much at the beginning. Real estate agents make the big money when clients buy or sell. Most agree that Rams players are more likely to rent than buy.\n\nMany players are on short-term contracts and NFL careers are notoriously brief. They average a little over three years, according to the players union. So if players have permanent homes in the St. Louis area or elsewhere, they may think twice about buying into the Los Angeles real estate market - especially given how expensive it is.\n\nThe median, or middle, home price in the Los Angeles area is $506,800\\\\. That is more than three times the median price of $160,000 in the St. Louis area, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nChukumerije recalled working with an NBA player who was renting a 4,200-square-foot home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He wanted to find something similar in Los Angeles' pricey Brentwood area.\n\n\"They were leasing in Fort Lauderdale for $5,600 a month, but in Brentwood, you're talking over $12,000,\" he said. \"We had to shift our search a little bit.\"\n\n## Agents Hope For Future Payoff\n\nBut even the lowest-paid NFL players make a league-minimum salary of $435,000, so they can afford Los Angeles-area prices. Still, the agents probably will line up a lot of rental units but arrange relatively few sales.\n\nAn agent might get paid 2 percent to 3 percent of a lease they help arrange. Even on a $10,000 a month lease, that's an annual commission of just $2,400\\\\. The rewards are tiny compared with the hundreds of thousands an agent might make on the sale of a multimillion-dollar home.\n\nBut agents say it's worth the effort. They hope to build up relationships with players now, which could lead to more business later on.\n\n\"You can do 10 leases that don't net much, but those lead to one sale that makes up for all of them,\" Nartey said.\n\n## Many Seek Home Near Training Site\n\nAside from the question of whether to rent or own, players will also have to decide where in Southern California they'd like to live.\n\nAgents think that Rams players will be interested in a few areas popular with pro athletes. Manhattan Beach has scenic beachfront property, and Calabasas has huge homes in secure, gated communities. Manhattan Beach is close to both Los Angeles International Airport and Inglewood, where a new stadium is being built. \n\nOther areas could see interest from players, too.\n\n\"For younger guys, the 21- to 25-year-olds who are single, I see them gravitating toward downtown LA and maybe Hollywood,\" Chukumerije said.\n\nMore than almost any other factor, agents said players will decide where to live based on the location of the team's training facility. That's where they will go for daily practice.\n\nNFL coaches are strict about players showing up on time at practices. Being even a few minutes late can cost a player hundreds of dollars, depending on a team's schedule of fines. Los Angeles' heavy traffic makes that a real possibility.\n\n\"The ballplayers are going to want to be somewhere convenient to the training facility. If the training facility is in whatever city, you might find players congregating there,\" said David Carter, who runs the Sports Business Institute at the USC Marshall School of Business.'"

            "text": "\tPYONGYANG, North Korea - Dennis Rodman is giving a \"birthday present\" to one of his most unlikely fans: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Rodman made the remarks on Monday before he and other former National Basketball Association players were set to play a rare game in the isolated nation.\n\nRodman's squad features ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker. They will play against a team of North Koreans on Wednesday, which is believed to be Kim's birthday. The former NBA players, who arrived in Pyongyang on Monday, also include Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks. Four streetballers are also on the squad.\n\nRodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea for the game, though he said he has gotten death threats for his repeated visits. He said proceeds from the game would go to a charity for the deaf in North Korea.\n\n\"The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way,\" Rodman said of Kim, using the leader's official title. \"I think that people thought that this was a joke, and Dennis Rodman is just doing this because fame and fortune.\" Instead, he said, he sees the game as a \"birthday present\" for Kim and his country.\n\n## A Political Minefield\n\n\"Just to even have us here, it's an awesome feeling. I want these guys here to show the world, and speak about North Korea in a great light,\" Rodman said. \"I hope people will have a different view about North Korea.\"\n\nThe game will be another milestone in Rodman's surprising relationship with Kim, who rarely meets with foreigners and about whom very little is known outside of North Korea. Rodman is the highest-profile American to meet Kim since the leader inherited power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.\n\nRodman traveled to North Korea for the first time last February with the Harlem Globetrotters for an HBO series. After spending time together, Rodman called Kim a \"friend for life.\" Rodman came back just before Christmas to hold tryouts for the North Korean basketball team, though he did not meet with Kim then.\n\nThe Hall of Fame basketball player has been given the red-carpet treatment on each of his trips, but visiting North Korea for any high-profile American is a political minefield. To keep the game itself friendly, the two sides will only play against each other in the first half, and then mix together in the second.\n\nAmericans are regarded as enemies in North Korea. The two countries never signed a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. Thousands of U.S. troops are still based in South Korea, and the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South is one of the most heavily armed borders in the world.\n\n## \"I'm Just An Athlete\"\n\nRelations are also tense because of the North's development of nuclear weapons and its threats to use them if a conflict breaks out with Washington or Seoul. Rodman has also been slammed for not trying to use his influence with Kim to secure the release of Kenneth Bae. Bae is an American missionary with health problems who is being held in North Korea on charges of committing \"anti-state\" crimes.\n\nTo make the trip more complicated, Kim's once-powerful uncle was recently executed for a long list of alleged crimes, including trying to divide the government and take power from Kim. Although that has generated speculation abroad about the government's unity, North Korean officials say the execution settled the issue and there is no instability.\n\nRodman, however, says none of that is his concern.\n\n\"I'm not a president, I'm not a politician, I'm not an ambassador,\" he said before arriving. \"I'm just an athlete and the reason for me to go is to bring peace to the world, that's it. That's all I want, no money. I want no money, no money.\"\n\nFormer Knicks player Smith said he hopes the game will lead to better relations between the two countries.\n\n\"It's new being here, but overall the concept is not new,\" he said. \"The team is made up of a lot of guys who really care, that's the most important, it's not about bringing dream-teamers. It's about guys who are coming that want to be a part of this, that care, and really that care about humanity.\"'"

            "text": "\tJIDDAH, Saudi Arabia - As the National Basketball Association (NBA) tips off its season in the United States, a group of women and girls in Saudi Arabia will be chasing their own hoop dreams.\n\nWomen's basketball is becoming popular in a kingdom that has strict rules about what women are allowed to do. Now, women are using basketball to push for greater rights on and off the courts in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"We are an activist team,\" said Lina Almaeena, who started the first women's basketball team here 11 years ago. In 2006, Jiddah United became the first sports club in Saudi Arabia to include women. \"We took it upon ourselves to really promote the sport at a time when it was a big time taboo.\"\n\n## An Act Of Defiance\n\nFor the players, basketball is not merely a sport. It's also an act of defiance in a country where female access to exercise is shunned by ultraconservatives. Physical education is still not taught to girls in Saudi public schools.\n\nWomen are bound by strict rules when it comes to what they wear. They cannot be seen by men while jogging in sweat pants, much less wearing fitted or revealing shorts. Most women in Saudi Arabia cover their hair and face with a veil known as the niqab and all women are required to wear a loose black dress known as the abaya in public.\n\nNevertheless, Saudi women's basketball is on the rise. Women from the ultraconservative kingdom are even playing in other Arab countries. Hadeer Sadagah, 20, started playing eight years ago with Almaeena at Jiddah United. She now plays at the college level for the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"I wouldn't be the person I am today without the sport and the team,\" she said. \"It made me be more active in society, school and in studies. It made me more social. It made me confident.\"\n\nAt a recent afternoon basketball practice in Jiddah, girls as young as 4 years old jumped, took shots and ran on open-air basketball courts behind gated concrete walls. Boys played in nearby courts. The children and their coaches stopped for daily prayers.\n\n## Male Coaches Can't Attend Games\n\nAlmaeena says basketball is becoming popular among Saudi girls because it offers the camaraderie of a team sport. Basketball is also seen as more acceptable by society. The girls can practice in loose, traditional clothes, and the sport can be played indoors and outdoors.\n\nThe sport has grown into a network of teams in different cities. No formal league exists but women's teams play in privately organized tournaments against a handful of other private schools, universities and club teams.\n\nDespite the growth, women's basketball in Saudi Arabia still faces a host of logistical obstacles. For one, the kingdom has rules about keeping men and women apart.\n\nWomen's teams are not part of the kingdom's federation that oversees sports. Women often struggle to find facilities to train and are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums. In Jiddah, the older female players practice and play in a female-only gym. They only play tournaments in front of other women, and even their male coaches do not attend games.\n\nIt wasn't until 2012 that Saudi Arabia sent its first female athletes to the Olympics - exactly two of them. But two years later for the 2014 Asian Games, the kingdom went back to its tradition of sending only men.\n\n## \"Immoral\" Track Suits\n\nAlmaeena's team generated some negative publicity in 2009 after they played a tournament in Jordan. The players were not wearing their abayas and photographs of them in modest track suits landed in local newspapers. They were labeled \"immoral\" and \"satanic,\" Almaeena said.\n\nIt makes sense that Jiddah would become the birthplace for women's basketball in Saudi Arabia. The coastal city is easily the country's most liberal and worldly. Jiddah's residents are a melting pot of ethnicities whose ancestors settled along an ancient trade route. The result has been a distinct and more open culture than Saudi cities like the capital, Riyadh.\n\n\"Jiddah is where women are most physically active in society,\" said Sadagah, the Jiddah-born player in Sharjah.\n\nJiddah created public spaces where women and young girls briskly stroll alongside men in sporty black robes. It is an unusual sight in a kingdom where women exercising is largely a private activity.\n\n## Sneakers And A Chauffeur\n\nHowever, even in Jiddah it is mostly rich women who play sports.\n\nJoining a club like Jiddah United costs around 600 riyals ($130) a month. Getting to a gym or sports club also requires paying for a driver, or chauffeur, because women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor now, women's basketball remains a fringe phenomenon in Saudi Arabia. But for enthusiastic players and their parents, its presence is a much-welcome source of both exercise and confidence-building life lessons.\n\nAlaa AlShuwayer, a pharmacist and mother to two young girls, recently checked out a basketball practice with Abdul Salam in Jiddah. She was considering enrolling her daughters.\n\n\"I know 100 percent there's nothing wrong with girls or boys playing sports,\" she said. \"I'd rather they play sports than buy them dresses and earrings.\"'"

Supporters say it makes teachers better.\n\nOfficials in these four-day districts make no apologies and insist their students will hold their own against students anywhere.\n\n\"Our ACT scores are the best they've been in 10 years, and our teachers love it,\" said Chris Fine, superintendent of the Lathrop school district in Clinton County, which went to four days in 2010. It was the first district in Missouri to do so after the General Assembly passed legislation a year earlier.\n\nMost of these are small, rural districts, such as Miami R-1, about an hour south of Kansas City. Its one school building, serving all grades, is surrounded by head-high corn this time of year and has so few students the boys play football for another school in a nearby town.\n\nThe Missouri law came with the requirement that any district incurring substantial drop-offs in performance must go back to the traditional five days, but no district has had to do that.\n\nWhen states first agreed to four-day schedules, the reason was to help small districts cut costs, savings that turned out to be minimal. But that's not why Miami switched this year.\n\n## Doing More In Four Than Five\n\n\"This is about making teachers better,\" Superintendent Frank Dahman said.\n\nHe is convinced that giving teachers those Mondays revs them up so they can do more with the new four than the old five days.\n\n\"Better-prepared teachers means better students, and that's where the rubber meets the road.\" No one knows for sure how many districts have gone to four-day schedules. The Education Commission of the States estimates the number at several hundred in 17 states - and going up.\n\nCutting back to four days is a big mistake, said Jennifer Davis, president of the National Center on Time and Learning, a Boston-based group that advocates more classroom time.\n\n\"The idea of narrowing the educational structure is absolutely the wrong direction,\" Davis said. \"We're past the time of graduating from high school and getting a middle-class job. Those jobs are gone.\"\n\nFor those in favor, the thinking is that the plan works best in rural areas where child care for those Mondays would be less of a problem, because a parent is at home or a grandparent is nearby.\n\nYou don't see the four-day week in large, urban districts, where parents typically work outside the home.\n\n## Child Care Concerns At First\n\nFine, the Lathrop superintendent, said child care was a major concern at first. But a community survey conducted halfway through the first year showed that more than 70 percent of parents supported the four-day schedule.\n\nDavis, with the National Center, thinks child care is often a socio-economic issue and should be a deal breaker against the four-day week.\n\n\"What about the families that can't afford enrichment activities, piano lessons and high-quality child care on those Mondays?\" she asked. \"What you would end up with in a lot of districts is kids spending those days in unsafe environments.\"\n\nDale Dennis, deputy commissioner for the Kansas Department of Education, said that for the 2010-2011 school year, the state had 16 districts going four days a week.\n\nThis year, the list includes four more, all in small, rural districts.\n\nAmanda McConnell, who had arrived at the Miami school to pick up her kindergartner, said she likes the idea of teachers having an extra day for planning, and is tired of hearing people complain that kids will be in school less time.\n\n\"They're going the same amount of time - just in a better way,\" she said.\n\n## Two Sisters Debate Four-Day Week\n\n\"But what about the kids having to stay longer each day?\" asked her sister, Amy Kelly.\n\n\"What - 20 minutes?\" McConnell said. \"I think they can handle that.\"\n\n\"I think young kids were checking out late in the day already,\" Kelly said. \"This is just going to make that worse.\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes, not two hours,\" McConnell said. \"And being off that Monday refreshes kids for the week.\"\n\nTheir mother, Susan Kelly, broke the tie: \"I would have to think more days means better retention.\"\n\nSuperintendent Dahman wants it known that by starting school a week earlier, students will be in class only 14 fewer hours over a school year. But having teachers come in every other Monday is worth 14 hours, because it gives teachers time to catch up, like on technology, especially older ones.\n\n\"Give me this time because I need it,\" said fifth-grade teacher Jeanne Burgin. \"I can use an iPad, but my students use it better than me. I have a family and my own kids. I don't want to be in here at midnight or weekends learning to use this thing.\"\n\n## Mondays For Work Or Homework\n\nStudents seem to be good with the change.\n\n\"I've got a job after school, and now I can use Monday to put in a good 10-hour day,\" senior David Weaver said.\n\nAshley Jellison, a senior volleyball player, said that because of Friday night games, athletes can't do homework that day.\n\n\"Now we have Mondays for that,\" she said.\n\nDylan Good was one student who disagreed.\n\n\"I think it's a waste of a day. We should be in school, and I think my parents would agree with me.\"'"

            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia - Slopestyle, the newest Olympic event, was always going to be a flashy addition to the Games.\n\nThe sport is an acrobatic, free-form assault on a snowy obstacle course of rails and jumps. Elements of danger wouldn't just be evident. They would be a selling point, a path that would lead \"slope\" from X Games curiosity to legitimacy at the highest levels of international sport.\n\nBut did the 2014 Winter Olympic Games go too far?\n\nOn Wednesday, Shaun White, the most famous snowboarder in the world, abruptly withdrew from slopestyle. He did so a day before competition would begin for the first time in the Olympics.\n\n## From \"Gnarly\" To \"Sketchy\"\n\nWhite's Olympics are not over; he is still scheduled to compete in another event, the halfpipe. That's no small matter - White is a halfpipe favorite, and capturing the gold would make him the first American man to win an event at three straight Winter Olympics.\n\nBut White's high-profile campaign to capture a medal in two events is done. This is another troubling development for a Winter Games that cost roughly $51 billion to stage, but has been beset by concerns over safety, cost overruns, human rights and construction woes. Much is at stake for Russia, which is hosting the Olympics for the first time since the Soviet Union broke up.\n\n\"The difficult decision to forgo slopestyle is not one I take lightly as I know how much effort everyone has put into holding the slopestyle event for the first time in Olympic history,\" White said.\n\nWhite's decision was the culmination of days of mounting evidence that event organizers had overreached and assembled a course that was risky even by the standards of this daring, alternative sport. The course crossed the line from \"gnarly\" to \"sketchy,\" as one Finnish competitor put it.\n\nEarlier this week, a favorite in the slopestyle competition, Torstein Horgmo of Norway, fell on a jump during a practice run and broke his collarbone, ending his Olympics. A Finnish competitor, Marika Enne, crashed on the course's third and final jump, hit her head and was hauled off in a stretcher. White jammed his wrist in a practice run.\n\nOlympic officials scrambled to respond. They met with athletes and tweaked the 2,083-foot-long course in an effort to moderate it.\n\n## \"Every Course Is Dangerous\"\n\nAuthorities had apparently anticipated that some snow would melt in the run-up to competition, a fair bet in this subtropical resort on the coast of the Black Sea. When that didn't happen, they attempted to reshape jumps that one athlete compared to leaping from the top of a building. Athletes also reported that rails - terrain features used to stage tricks and stunts - were too sticky and needed to be waxed.\n\nSome slopestyle athletes downplayed the risks of the course.\n\n\"Snowboarding is dangerous. Like crossing a street is dangerous,\" said Canadian Mark McMorris, who is trying to push forward despite suffering a broken rib less than two weeks ago at the X Games.\n\nSage Kotsenburg, one of White's Olympic teammates, called the modified course \"sick\" - a compliment, in this world.\n\n\"The snow's getting better,\" he said after a training session. \"It's still a little bit icy. I mean, it's a dangerous course. Every course is dangerous. It is a risk we take dropping in every time.\"\n\nStill, even the modified course was apparently not enough to satisfy White. \"The potential risk of injury is a bit too much for me to gamble my other Olympics goals on,\" White said.\n\nAuthorities from the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) supported White's decision.\n\n\"Shaun is the consummate professional and has made a sound athletic decision,\" said Jeremy Forster, the USSA's snowboarding and free-skiing director.\n\n## X Games Event At  Olympics\n\nSlopestyle was fast-tracked into the Olympics only three years ago, an unusual departure for the conservative International Olympic Committee. For some sports, Olympic inclusion has come after decades of competition and lobbying.\n\nEven slopestyle athletes were taken by surprise by the decision; most had assumed that the event would not make its Olympic debut until at least 2018. Many observers saw the decision as a reflection of the Olympics' desire to reinvent itself and attract a younger audience.\n\n\"Slopestyle is probably the most relevant of the sports to the masses of youth that participate in skiing and snowboarding,\" said Chris Gunnarson, president of Snow Park Technologies, which has designed and built slopestyle courses for the X Games. \"Many kids are going to be able to relate and they are going to be able to see athletes doing the same kinds of things they could do, to a higher level.\"\n\nThe sport has been shadowed by tragedy. One of its most prominent competitors, Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke, died in a training accident two years ago. The X Games champion pushed hard for the inclusion of the sport in the Olympics, and her teammates planned on honoring her in Sochi with a helmet decal.'"

            "text": "\tATLANTA - Arthur Blank put on traditional soccer garb on Wednesday, to mark the announcement of his new Major League Soccer team, which will be based in Atlanta.\n\n\"I love this one,\" Blank said, looking down at the red, black and gold scarf draped over his dark suit. \"I haven't taken it off since it was given to me. I may not sleep in it tonight, but I may. I haven't decided yet.\"\n\nThe team will begin play in 2017 at the city's new retractable roof stadium. The team will be owned by Blank, who also controls the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.\n\nBlank said he first started talking with MLS about bringing a team to the city about a decade ago.\n\nThe off-and-on discussions picked up again after Blank reached a deal with the city last year to build a new $1 billion downtown stadium next to the soon-to-be-demolished Georgia Dome. He is putting up most of the money, with the city kicking in $200 million from a hotel tax.\n\n## No Name Yet\n\n\"I think Atlanta is a natural fit for Major League Soccer,\" said Blank, who was serenaded by a growing fan group that calls itself \"Terminus Legion,\" a reference to Atlanta's former name.\n\nThe team's name has not been decided. Blank said he will get input from the fans before choosing it. He already knows the colors, though: red and black - matching the Falcons - with a substantial amount of gold as well.\n\n\"What the name will be, we really don't know,\" he said. \"We will spend a lot of time listening to our fans and trying to understand why some names are more important than others, why certain designs are more important than others, why certain logos are more important than others.\"\n\nOne name that won't be considered is the Atlanta Chiefs. That's the name of two previous teams that played in the old North American Soccer League. While the Chiefs won the first NASL championship in 1968, both teams struggled financially and eventually folded.\n\nMLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta, after Blank worked out a stadium deal.\n\nAtlanta is the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. and the biggest without a top-level soccer team. The city has a large Hispanic population and last month drew more than 68,000 fans to the Georgia Dome for a friendly match between Mexico and Nigeria.\n\n## Soccer-Friendly Stadium\n\n\"This is something that will help elevate our league,\" Garber said. \"It will also elevate our sport in the entire Southeast, which is something that is very important to us strategically.\"\n\nThe league went all out to promote its newest team. Hundreds of fans turned out for a street festival. Blank and Garber arrived by helicopter for the introductory news conference, touching down on the roof of a downtown hotel overlooking Centennial Olympic Park. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed also attended.\n\nWhile the new stadium is primarily designed for the Falcons, Blank stressed that it will be soccer-friendly. The stands along the sideline can be moved back to accommodate the larger soccer pitch.\n\nCurtains will fall from the roof and close off the upper sections, to make the venue appear smaller. MLS games attract a smaller crowd than football games.\n\nThe new facility is designed to seat about 71,000 for NFL games, Blank said, but can be reduced to about 29,000 for soccer using only the lower bowl.\n\n\"There will never be an MLS game in Atlanta where NFL lines are shown on the field,\" Blank said, drawing a big cheer.\n\n## \"Thinking About Soccer\"\n\nMLS, which has 19 teams this season, is expanding rapidly with a goal of having 24 teams by the end of the decade.\n\nOrlando and New York City are scheduled to begin play next season. The league has also awarded a provisional team in Miami to a group led by David Beckham, if they can build a soccer-specific stadium there.\n\nThe league has added five teams in the past five years, including the hugely successful Seattle Sounders. Garber said there is no worry about growing too fast given the abundance of soccer talent around the world.\n\n\"When we expand, we can pick from players around the world,\" Garber said. \"We could change the roster rules, the international player limits, and have no dilution in talent.\"\n\nBlank said he will try to encourage some crossover between Falcons' season-ticket holders and those interested in attending MLS games. But he said the teams are likely to have very different fan bases. The new soccer team will not merely be a side business for the Falcons, he said.\n\nHis first task is to hire a team president for the MLS venture. He will also be exploring possible locations for a state-of-the-art training facility.\n\n\"We don't want any stepchildren in our family,\" Blank said. \"We want to make sure the people running soccer get up in the morning thinking about soccer and go to bed thinking about soccer.\"'"

            "title": "Study warns of risks in heading the ball too much in soccer",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES-Heading the ball is a key soccer skill. But a new study finds that players who headed the ball frequently were more likely to suffer brain injury and damage their memory than players who were a little less likely to use their heads.\n\nSports like American football and ice hockey get most of the attention when it comes to [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) and other forms of traumatic brain injury. But soccer is an intense physical sport for which the head can be as important as the foot.\n\nStill, since research hasn't linked heading to concussions, players, coaches and medical professionals have generally stayed on the sidelines with regard to its risks.\n\n\"For many people, it's beyond belief that minor injuries could be a problem,\" said Dr. Michael Lipton, a neuroradiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Lipton was the lead author of the study published online Tuesday by the journal _Radiology_.\n\n## Adult League Soccer Players Tested\n\nLipton said he hasn't headed a ball himself since he played youth soccer. But he is intently interested in the added effects of repetitive traumatic brain injury. Soccer was a good sport for his research.\n\n\"With soccer, we know we have people who are going to experience exposure - who are going to head the ball - and we have a way to quantify that exposure,\" he said.\n\nLipton and his colleagues interviewed 37 adult league soccer players from New York City and took high-tech scans of their brains. They also asked the players how often they played soccer and approximately how often they headed the ball, and they gave the players a battery of neurocognitive tests.\n\nThey divided the players into three groups - low heading, medium heading and high heading - and found that players who headed the ball the most had the lowest scores on memory tests. They also had the lowest average scores for a metric called fractional anisotropy, FA. That is a measure of the health of the brain's white matter-the billions of nerve fibers that connect different parts of the brain. Low FA scores have also been found in people who have suffered concussions.\n\nThese findings were independent of players' concussion history and demographic factors, which were controlled for in the study.\n\n## No Link Found Between Heading And Brain Injury\n\nThe researchers found no link between heading and players' attention, ability to visually track objects or ability to manage complex thinking tasks.\n\nThe relationship between heading and traumatic brain injury was not simply a matter of more heading leading to more injury. Instead, the researchers discovered that players could safely head the ball 885 to 1,550 times a year without experiencing FA problems. It took almost 1,800 headers for players to have trouble with their memory.\n\nThere were some players below those levels who showed FA and memory problems. So some people may be more sensitive to heading the ball.\n\nHowever, Lipton cautioned players not to dismiss the potential risks of heading the ball too many times.\n\nLipton suggests that soccer start keeping a \"head count\" to monitor the number of headers players use in a given game. The head count would be similar to the \"pitch count\" in baseball. Teams use that to make sure that pitchers do not throw too many pitches in one game.\n\nPractice is also important to consider, Lipton said. The number of headers is usually greater in practice than in games, although they are made at lower speed.\n\n## Concussions A Big Problem in American Football\n\nAmerican football probably is the sport that comes to most people's minds when they think of concussions. The National Football League has been sued by former players who have suffered concussion-related diseases.  In March, the league and General Electric Co said they were working together to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain injuries. The league has also been looking at different helmet designs to help prevent concussions.\n\nSo should soccer's David Beckham have been wearing a helmet during his years with Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Galaxy? Not so fast, Lipton cautioned.\n\n\"We can't yet infer a definitive cause and effect from this study,\" he said. The study was based on a small sample size. Most of the subjects were male (28 men, nine women). Also, the data were collected at a single point in time. There is more studying to be done.\n\nAnd more research is on the way. Lipton's team recently landed a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to extend the work.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're concerned about heading the ball too much, keep it mostly to your feet.'"

            "text": "\tOAKLAND, Calif. - The boys of Oakland International High School play soccer under a blazing sun, on hot black asphalt. The newest player, Paulos Gurmu, is from Ethiopia. Other players are from countries like Burma, Colombia, Yemen and Liberia.\n\nDuring the girls' game, Fernanda Barrera, a 10th-grader from Guatemala, screamed coaching advice to fellow players from the sidelines. \"Relax, blue, and pass the ball,\" she yelled to her team.\n\nPlaying soccer allows these students to make friends, work together and gain confidence - even before they have learned English.\n\nOakland International is home to students from nearly three dozen countries, many of whom are refugees who came to the U.S. to escape war in their homelands, where some of them witnessed terrible things. A fourth of the students had little or no formal education before arriving.\n\n## \"Soccer As A Tool\"\n\nIn this mixing pot of cultures and languages, unity comes in part through Soccer Without Borders. The  program was started at this campus and has since spread globally. Founder Ben Gucciardi created the group to help youths bond across cultural gaps and grow as leaders in and out of the classroom.\n\nThrough soccer, Barrera said, we can communicate \"with people who are different from us.\"\n\nGucciardi, a semipro soccer player with a master's degree in alternative education, started Soccers Without Borders at Oakland International in 2008 as a volunteer.\n\nThese days, half of the school's more than 300 students participate at some point during the year and team members have a 95 percent graduation rate.\n\n\"I see soccer as a tool,\" said Gucciardi. He sets out rules the youths must follow: healthy eating, a helping spirit and, above all, respectful treatment of others on and off the field. \"I'm not interested in winning or losing; but if this is something that can help these amazing young people get where they want to go, then we've done our job.\"\n\nOmar Benitez, 18, from Bogota, Colombia, made his first school friend - from Liberia - on the soccer team, even before he could speak English. \"Coach Ben\" has helped him prepare for his SAT exams and apply for college scholarships, even advising him on his relationship with a new step-father.\n\nBenitez said Gucciardi has made a huge difference in his new life in America, acting like a second father to the teen.\n\nNow, Benitez and the other players are uniting off the field. They are tired of practicing on broken asphalt or playing at parks, so the students at Oakland International are asking for a field of their own.\n\n## Fighting For A Field\n\nThe field next to Oakland International High was given to a parents group from another high school years ago. At the time, Oakland International was so tiny that school leaders thought it didn't need an athletic field, so parents from the other school raised more than $400,000 to turn it into a baseball field.\n\nFor a while, the international students were allowed to use the field for physical education class and for soccer, but eventually, the baseball parents didn't like the sharing arrangement. Starting last fall, the international students were no longer allowed to use the field.\n\n\"It feels sad,\" said Graciela Bibiano, 17, a lanky captain of the girls team who grew up playing soccer near Acapulco, Mexico. \"We don't get to play together as a team and a big family. And that's what we are.\"\n\nNow, the soccer-playing international students are getting a lesson in democracy in action as they fight for the right to play.\n\nBolor Erdenebat, 17, from Mongolia, went along with other students to a school board meeting, where she spoke and said she was impressed by the school board members' diplomacy.\n\n\"It was a whole process, with people demonstrating their ideas and trying to get something,\" she said.\n\n## At The Board Meeting\n\nYasser Alwan, 17, used multimedia skills he learned at Oakland International High. During an internship at the school district's TV station, he worked for hours to create a promotional video for the soccer field campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Solomon Camara, a 17-year-old from Liberia, began approaching board members by phone and email. \"I learned that politics is a little fun - I just like it,\" he said. \"Before, I would have felt intimidated.\"\n\nThe school district held a meeting in April in the school cafeteria. The International students were on one side and the baseball parents were on the other. The parents were mainly angry at the district, but some comments were unpleasant - like the suggestion that the young refugees could return to their own countries if they were dissatisfied here.\n\n\"Some of them, they hide some hate for us,\" Benitez said in an interview later.\n\nStill, both groups came to the middle of the room to shake hands at the end where the conversation continued. School officials now hope to create a field on city land that could be used for soccer, baseball and softball.\n\n\"It gives me a lot of heartache to see that much conflict,\" said school board member Jody London, who represents the district and must work on behalf of both schools. \"But it's really shown these students that they can have a voice and they can make a difference.\"'"

            "text": "\t### PRO: This is so cool\n\nVIENNA, Va. - Unbelievably, World Cup soccer has become the topic of conversation at work.\n\nIn recent weeks, television ratings for the sport have soared. Games involving Team USA have equaled the recent NBA finals and surpassed baseball's World Series. \"Watch Parties\" drew tens of thousands nationwide and huge crowds at AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas and Soldier Field in Chicago.\n\nThis time around America embraced the \"beautiful game\" of stunning goals and incomprehensible offsides, joyous patriotism and comic-looking flops due to several key reasons:\n\nConvenient starting times: First-round group games from Brazil began at noon, with another contest to follow and the final match at early evening on the East Coast. They soon became a great reason to skip out early from work.\n\n## Games Move Along Nicely\n\nShort durations: The games take 2 1/2 hours to play. Without timeouts, except for an occasional water break due to the jungle heat, you can set your watch by soccer. Less than three hours to watch a sporting event? That's been downright delightful and makes you realize what time-vampires baseball, football and even college basketball have become with their commercial breaks and constant timeouts.\n\nShaky goaltenders: With the exception of Mexico's Guillermo Ochoa and the USA's Tim Howard, few keepers demonstrated they could single-handedly steal a game for their side. Any shot became a good shot in Brazil. That's quite different from hockey's Stanley Cup playoffs, for example, where you sometimes wonder if anybody is going to score.\n\nUpsets galore: After the dust settled in Week One, reigning champion Spain and always powerful England had already been eliminated. That left the door open for such countries as Colombia, Costa Rica, Algeria and Chile to show their stuff.\n\n## Chants of USA!\n\n\"USA, USA:\" Despite being placed in the same division with such heavyweights as Germany, Ghana and Portugal, the Americans made it out of the so-called \"Group of Death\" and took Belgium to overtime before being eliminated.\n\nTo his credit, American coach Jurgen Klinsmann urged his team to go toe-to-toe with the traditional soccer powers and thanks to scoring star Clint Dempsey and such youngsters as DeAndre Yedlin (20 years old) and Julian Green (19) that often happened. No more siege mentality for this crew, and that's a far cry from former American squads in the World Cup.\n\n\"We are all very, very proud of this team,\" Klinsmann said. \"They made their country proud with this performance and also their entire performance in this World Cup.\"\n\nTeam USA may be out of this year's tournament, but it didn't go quietly. If anything it left the world stage with some attitude, even defiance. That could make all the difference in the years ahead.\n\n## Kids Get Hooked On The Game\n\nFor decades, kids in this country, as in the rest of the world, have grown up playing soccer. Drive through suburbia on the weekends, and you'll see fields of tykes chasing a speckled ball.\n\nUntil now, that's where it ended. Once kids stopped playing the game, they fell into the more traditional viewing habits of college football on Saturdays, the National Football League on Sundays, with a baseball and college basketball game when there was more at stake.\n\nYet this time around, more Americans checked out the World Cup than ever before and they often enjoyed what they saw. For once you give the beautiful game a long look, as the rest of the world knows, it's difficult to turn away. Especially when you're cheering a team that refuses to back down.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n> Tim Wendel is the writer-in-residence at Johns Hopkins University and the author of 11 books, including \"Summer of '68\" and \"Castro's Curveball.\"\\n>\\n> This essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers. McClatchy-Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of McClatchy-Tribune or its editors.\n\n### CON: What's with America's sudden fascination with soccer?\n\nWASHINGTON - Soccer is easy to mock and poke fun at.  In what other sport can we put together a scorecard of the number of fake \"injuries\" or the time the supposedly injured players spent writhing on the ground in apparent agony?\n\nIn what other sport can \"injured\" players be regularly carried off on stretchers only to return to the game seconds later? When's the last time you saw that in any American sport?\n\nI am not here to mock.  I've tried to like soccer because it seemed like the open-minded thing to do.\n\nLet me set the stage: it is the summer of 1994 and I am a graduate student living in London.  Each summer, the dormitory in which I lived had an arrival of Italian students who, in a pleasant example of international outreach, insisted that I watch the World Cup with them.\n\nI did so, game in and game out, in the name of sportsmanship and good will. And, to the joy of my newfound friends, Italy progressed all the way to the final against mighty Brazil.\n\nAnd so we watched what I was told would be sports at its best. For 90 minutes we watched.  And no one scored.  We watched through extra time and still no one scored.\n\nAt last the game was settled through a shootout, in which the goalie guesses which side of the goal the opposing player will kick the ball and dives in that general direction. Italy's goalie guessed wrong and Brazil walked off the World Cup champions.  A coin flip might have been slightly less dramatic, but the effect was pretty much the same.\n\n## As Dull As Baseball\n\nThis helps explain why soccer may be the world's sport, but not yet America's.  I don't begrudge my foreign friends' love of soccer.  And I am honest enough to admit that baseball is pretty dull.\n\nSoccer is a fine game. However, American football and basketball are a battle, based on deceptive tactics, drive and the repeated attack on the opponent's weaknesses.\n\nWhen a football or basketball coach isolates a gap in the opposing team's strategy - or plan - or a mismatch of players, he will take advantage of that weakness again and again. And his team will score points as a result.\n\nThe level of teamwork and coordination demanded of athletes, and strategic thinking of coaches, is simply far higher in American sports.  And a strategic error by coaches or a substantial playing mistake by athletes on the field will almost always cost that team on the scoreboard.\n\nSure, a basketball or American football game can be decided by a lucky play or a bad call, if it's very close.  But the relative ease by which teams can score in the most popular U.S. sports makes it very unlikely that the better team will lose the game.  Not so in soccer, which is filled with fine plays that go unrewarded and terrible errors that go unpunished.\n\n## Something's Up With The Stats\n\nOr simply consider basic statistics such as time of possession, which measures which team controls the ball throughout the game.\n\nControlling the ball is a basic measure of a team's dominance, and in American football the team that wins the battle for ball-control wins the game around two-thirds of the time. In soccer, by contrast, time of possession appears to be unrelated to victory. American sports are famously buried in statistics, but all these stats are meaningful in understanding who won and why.\n\nAt the end of the day, sports are entertainment - not a matter of life or death, unless you're the Colombian defender who was murdered after scoring an own-goal in that same 1994 World Cup by deflecting a U.S. shot past his own goalie.  He would have been 47 this year.\n\nIf millions of people want to watch a bunch of men kick a ball around for 90-plus minutes only to end in a scoreless tie, that's OK by me.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n>Andrew G.

            "title": "Farewell from Russia: Sochi Games end with fireworks and ballet",
            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia - Flushed with pride after a spectacular showing at the costliest Olympics ever, Russia celebrated 17 days of sport-driven global unity with a farewell show on Sunday night.\n\nRowdy spectators chanted \"Ro-ssi-ya! Ro-ssi-ya!\" - \"Russia! Russia!\" - before being surrounded by multicolored fireworks and carried through a visually stunning, sometimes surrealistic overview of Russian history and culture. The crowd was in a party mood after the high-security games passed off safely without any of the feared terror attacks.\n\nThe closing ceremony, a farewell from Russia with love and pageantry, started at 20:14 local time. The time was a nod to the year 2014, which Russian President Vladimir Putin seized upon to remake Russia's image. He has wanted to make the most of the Olympics' power to wow and focus global attention on his nation's enormous resources.\n\n\"Now we can see our country is very friendly,\" said Boris Kozikov of St. Petersburg, Russia. \"This is very important for other countries around the world to see.\"\n\n## \"Sochi Selfies\" Phrase Is Born\n\nRussia's $51 billion investment topped even the estimated $40 billion China spent on the 2008 Summer Games. The huge sum transformed Sochi from a decaying resort town on the Black Sea into a household name. All-new facilities, unthinkable in the Soviet era of drab shoddiness, showcased how far Russia has come in the two decades since it turned its back on communism.\n\nBut the Olympic show didn't win over critics of Russia. Under Putin, critics say it has gone backward on democracy, human rights and its treatment of gays.\n\nDespite the bumps along the way, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach was expected to use the closing ceremony to deliver an upbeat verdict of the games. One of Sochi's big successes was security. Feared attacks by Islamic militants who threatened to target the games didn't come to pass.\n\n\"It's amazing what has happened here,\" Bach said a few hours before the ceremony.\n\nAs dusk fell, Russians and international visitors streamed into the stadium for the ceremony featuring the extinguishing of the Olympic flame. Day and night, the flame became a favorite backdrop for \"Sochi selfies.\" The phrase was born at these games for the fad of athletes and spectators taking souvenir photos of themselves.\n\nRussia celebrated itself and its rich gifts to the worlds of music and literature in the ceremony. Performers in smart tails and puffy white wigs performed a ballet of grand pianos, pushing 62 of them around the stadium floor. Meanwhile, a piano soloist played thunderous bars from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 2.\n\nThere was, of course, also ballet, for which Russia is famous. Dancers from the Bolshoi and the Mariinsky - among the world's oldest ballet companies - performed. The faces of Russian authors through the ages were projected onto enormous screens, and a pile of books transformed into a swirling tornado of loose pages.\n\n## Rivals-Turned-Friends Say Goodbye\n\nAthletes were saying goodbye to rivals-turned-friends from far-off places, savoring their achievements or regretting what might have been. Some looked ahead to the 2018 Winter Games at Pyeongchang in South Korea.\n\nWinners of Russia's record 13 gold medals marched into the stadium carrying the country's white, blue and red flag, which was raised alongside the Olympic flag. Athletes streamed by their hundreds into the stadium, dancing and taking photos of themselves. Earlier, giant screens flashed highlights of their Olympic feats. With a 3-0 victory over Sweden in the men's hockey final Sunday, Canada claimed the last gold from the 98 medal events.\n\nAbsent were six competitors caught by what was the most extensive anti-doping program in Winter Olympic history. The IOC conducted a record 2,631 drug tests - nearly 200 more than originally planned.\n\nPutin smiled as he stood beside Bach, and he had reason to be pleased.\n\nRussia's athletes topped the Sochi medals table, both in golds and a total of 33. That represented a stunning turnaround from the 2010 Vancouver Games. There, a meager three golds and 15 total for Russia seemed proof of its gradual decline as a winter sports power since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Russia's bag of Sochi gold was the biggest-ever haul by a non-Soviet team.\n\nRussia's golden run started with aging star Evgeni Plushenko leading Russia to victory in team figure skating. Putin was on hand for that, one of multiple times when he popped up at venues across the games.\n\n## \"Success Of The Home Team\"\n\nRussia's last gold came Sunday in the four-man bobsled. The games' signature moment for home fans was Adelina Sotnikova. Cool as ice at 17, she became Russia's first gold medalist in women's Olympic figure skating.\n\n\"The success of the home team is always an important part of the success of the games overall,\" Bach said.\n\nNot all of the headlines out of Sochi were about sport. Organizers faced criticism going in about Russia's strict policies toward gays. Though, once the games were under way, most every athlete chose not to use the Olympic spotlight to campaign for the cause. When a group of female punk rockers who had recently been released from prison appeared in public to perform, Cossack militiamen horsewhipped them, drawing international scrutiny.\n\nAnd during the last days of competition, Sochi competed for attention with violence in Ukraine, Russia's neighbor.\n\nIn an Associated Press interview on Saturday, Bach singled out Ukraine's victory in women's biathlon relay as \"really an emotional moment\" of the games. He praised Ukrainian athletes for staying to compete despite the scores dead in protests back home.\n\n\"Mourning on the one hand, but knowing what really is going on in your country, seeing your capital burning, and feeling this responsibility, and then winning the gold medal,\" he said, \"this really stands out for me.\"'"

            "title": "Kansas schools to reward special-needs athletes with varsity letters",
            "text": "\tWICHITA, Kan. - Athletes with special needs just scored a big win in Wichita, Kansas: varsity letters.\n\nFor more than a century, these colorful, letter-shaped patches have been awarded to members of the most competitive sports teams in high schools across the country; athletes usually show them off by having them sewn onto \"letter jackets\" and \"letter sweaters.\"\n\nThanks to a recent school board vote, Wichita athletes with special needs can now earn varsity letters for reaching challenging athletic goals of their own.\n\n## One Athlete Made A Difference\n\nThe campaign to award varsity letters to athletes with special needs started with Michael Kelley, a student at Wichita East High School.\n\nMichael attracted national attention when his mother, Jolinda Kelley, said school employees told her son not to wear his letter jacket. She had purchased a varsity letter for it. Officials from Michael's school district insist that no one asked him to remove his jacket.\n\nSo the school board put together a varsity-letter policy. It is just one part of a six-page set of guidelines put together by the Tri-County Athletic League, a sports league for students with special needs throughout 11 Wichita-area high schools. The Wichita school board recently voted in favor of using the league's guidelines in the city's high school athletics departments.\n\nAccording to league coordinator Bryan Wilson, students on Tri-County teams will have the opportunity to earn varsity letters as early as this school year.\n\n## Rewarding Teamwork And Effort\n\nTo be considered for a letter, athletes with special needs must play a sport for at least two seasons and attend a minimum of 70 percent of practices and games. They must also demonstrate good sportsmanship, give consistent effort, keep their grades up and exhibit respect.\n\nAt the Wichita school board meeting, Michael Kelley sat in the audience alongside his family members. They wore black T-shirts that read \"#givethemletters,\" a social media hashtag that has been associated with their campaign.\n\nJolinda Kelley pointed out that even though the phrase \"give them letters\" had become popular, she was not asking Michael's school to simply \"give\" him a varsity letter. She believes that Michael and other athletes with special needs deserve varsity letters because they demonstrate persistence, exhibit teamwork and overcome adversity.\n\n\"I'm asking for you to give them the letters that they've earned,\" Jolinda Kelley said.\n\nEvery single member of the school board agreed that Wichita schools should do just that. They all voted to use the Tri-County Athletic League's guidelines for athletes with special needs.\n\n## \"Dedication To All Students\"\n\nAfter hearing the results of the vote, Jolinda Kelley said that she was thankful that the school board had heard her message. She also said that she was disappointed that resolving the issue had to come down to a vote.\n\n\"The school should encourage their employees, from the top to the bottom, to answer parents' inquiries in a timely and respectful and informed manner,\" said Tonda McGrath, Jolinda Kelley's partner. \"Had this happened when we first started emailing and calling ... we would not be here today.\"\n\nMarty Rothwell, an official with a local social services agency, also spoke out about the results of the vote. Rothwell thanked district officials for supporting the Tri-County league's efforts to give students with intellectual and developmental disabilities a way to practice, compete and represent their schools.\n\n\"We could not find another school district that does this,\" he said. \"So we are here today to thank you, because without this league, we wouldn't have a letter issue. When we ask the parents, they all say the same thing: This is our kids' chance to shine, and it's all because of Unified School District 259 and your dedication to all students.\"'"

            "text": "\tTOKYO, Japan - Chikara Yamanobe is about as far from a sumo wrestler as it's possible for a little Japanese kid to be. He's so skinny that his ribs stick out, and his eyes tear up when he gets pushed around roughly in the ring. He's also just 5 years old.\n\nStill, Chikara, whose name means \"power,\" wants to be a professional sumo wrestler when he grows up.\n\n\"I want to be like Endo,\" he said after training for almost three hours at a dojo in Tokyo, referring to the Japanese sumo star.\n\nChances are Chikara won't make it.\n\n## A Particularly Tough Life\n\nJapan's national sport, with its traditions and rituals from the Shinto religion and requirement for physical bulk, is in decline. Boys in this baseball-mad country have lost interest in a sport that is seldom shown on prime-time TV and offers little in the way of cool products to buy, like sumo toys or T-shirts or costumes.\n\nIn recent years, sumo has become dominated by foreigners. When the summer grand sumo tournament wrapped up this month, the winners were all from somewhere else. Terunofuji Haruo - a Mongolian born with the name of Gantulga Ganerdene - emerged victorious from a competition that featured two of his countrymen and a Bulgarian in the top rankings. Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, along with an Egyptian and a couple of Georgians, also have done well this year.\n\nThis is partly the result of a general trend away from rigid traditions in Japan, and also because the life of a professional sumo wrestler is particularly tough. Aspiring sumo wrestlers must leave school at 15. They live in training quarters, known as a \"stable,\" where everything from their hairstyle to their diet is decided for them.\n\nIt also stems in part from a lack of access. The main sumo matches happen in the afternoon. They are shown on television while most kids are in school, and sumo arenas are filled largely with senior citizens and tourists.\n\nMike Wesemann, an American who runs the blog Sumo Talk, said that sumo is losing its fans. Plus, it's having a hard time competing with other sports. Sumo wrestlers wear a loincloth, a piece of cloth wrapped around their hips. There are no jerseys and hats kids can wear like in baseball and soccer, and they can't exactly practice with their dads.\n\n\"There's just nothing cool about it,\" Wesermann said.\n\n## \"To Expand The Player Base\"\n\nSumo officials are all too aware of this.\n\n\"Sumo is not a familiar sport compared to others like soccer and baseball,\" said Kento Nakazawa of the Japan Sumo Association.\n\n\"There aren't many opportunities for kids to get to play sumo, so our aim is to provide an occasion,\" Nakazawa said. \"We'll be happy if anyone, even one child, gets interested and starts to play.\"\n\nNoboru Yoshimura, administrative chief of the Japanese Sumo Federation, said he was worried about sumo's declining popularity. Even though martial arts is now offered in junior high school, kids are not choosing sumo.\n\nYoshimura said the sumo federation now provides a three-day sumo training course for teachers to boost interest. \"Sumo doesn't require much, there's no equipment necessary, and it's easier to start, so we are promoting sumo that way in order to expand the player base,\" he said.\n\nParticipation in the Wanpaku sumo tournament for children has dropped from 70,000 kids in 1994 to 33,000 in 2014.\n\n## Having To Bulk Up\n\nStill, at the dojo in Tokyo, boys exercised, wrestled with coaches and fetched Band-Aids for scratches and scrapes.\n\nBoys - and they are almost always boys, as girls and women have not traditionally been allowed in the ring - generally practice sumo as a sport until high school. Then, if they want to continue, things become a lot more serious.\n\nToshiyo Abe sat on the tatami mats watching his 6-year-old son Shotaro wrestle older boys. Shotaro asked to start sumo a year ago, so now they travel an hour by train to the dojo every Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\"I'm a little envious that he is having so much fun,\" Abe said.\n\nSome parents, however, balk at a key part of getting ahead in sumo: being heavy.\n\n\"Some high school clubs make you eat until you throw up, but some clubs just leave it to you to bulk up,\" said Akiteru Kiyomiya as he watched his two sons train. \"If this is the path they want to take, then yes, I'll support them.\"\n\nYet the boys' mother, Yumi Kiyomiya, was not so sure. \"I actually don't want them to get big,\" she said.\n\n## The Next Yokozuna?\n\nAfter the four-hour training session, coach Shinju Taira said he worried about the decline of sumo both as a sport and as a part of Japanese culture.\n\n\"It's not that everybody will get into the professional levels, but we're trying to raise future leaders, people who can be leaders in our society,\" he said.\n\nHisao Yoshiyoka, who had two sons on the mat at the dojo, said she was happy about her boys' experience.\n\nShe said they are learning how to survive in Japanese society, where everyone knows their position, and at the same time they're learning about Japanese traditions.\n\nHer youngest son, Ryudai, 7, has already chosen his professional sumo wrestler name. Watch out in 2030 for a yokozuna, or grand champion, called Dairyu.'"

            "title": "Some Turks say government is adding religion to country's schools",
            "text": "\tANKARA, Turkey - Ahmet Guvener, a Christian pastor in Turkey, got an exemption to keep his daughter from taking Islamic religion classes required by her school. But the alternatives the school offered her were more religious classes.\n\nHis daughter had to choose from three electives: the life of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, a study of Islam's holy book, the Quran, or basic religious knowledge. Without that class, she would fail the year.\n\n\"It seriously damaged my child's psychology,\" said Guvener, who heads the Protestant Church in the city of Diyarbakir, in southeast Turkey. He accuses the school of forcing religious education on the students, but the teachers union denies that claim.\n\nGuvener said the school told him it only offered religion classes because there was no demand for any other electives. He could not believe that, out of 900 students, not one asked for an elective in math or English. The school offered her an astronomy class after he spoke to the media about her case.\n\nMany parents, teachers and students in Turkey are complaining that the government is adding more religion to the country's schools. Thousands of people have protested in the streets recently, asking the government to stop trying to impose Muslim religious ideas in the schools.\n\n## Turkey's Secular Tradition\n\nTurkey, a country between Europe and the Middle East, has long followed the secular, non-religious ideals of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of Turkey. The country is majority Muslim, but the schools are not all religious. Just until recently, the education system had banned Islamic headscarves in schools and made schoolchildren begin the day reciting a pledge of allegiance to Ataturk's legacy.\n\nNow, supporters of that secular tradition claim President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is taking a new path. They say Erdogan, a Muslim whose wife wears a headscarf in public, is building an Islamic education system. They point out he has stated his goal is to raise \"pious generations.\" That is, he wants the Turkish people to be more religious.\n\nThe government has loosened the headscarf ban, increased the number of religious schools and stopped the pledge of allegiance. It said student freedom was the reason for bringing back headscarves, but at same time, the schools have banned tattoos, body piercings and dyed hair. Traditional Muslims ban tattoos and piercings, and they insist women must cover their hair with headscarves.\n\nPresident Erdogan's political group, the Justice and Development Party, insists it is only following majority rule in a conservative country. It says the education measures mean to pull back restrictions on religious education that were imposed in 1997. At the time, the military, which saw itself as the guardian of Ataturk's secular values, was strong enough to pressure the Islamic-led government out of power. In what became known as a \"soft military coup,\" the military also moved to close down vocational religious schools.\n\n## \"Education Is An Ideological Tool\"\n\n\"Education is an ideological tool,\" said Sakine Esen Yilmaz, secretary-general of the Education and Science Laborer's Union, a liberal group that opposes the increase of religion in schools. Education is now being used \"to raise an obedient generation that will serve the government.\"\n\nIn Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, thousands of people demonstrated to support secular education. They urged the government to stop what they saw as a campaign to impose the Sunni faith, the Muslim sect followed by the majority of Turks. They also demanded respect for the rights of students from the Alevi Shiite sect that makes up Turkey's largest religious minority.\n\nHundreds of pro-secular and Alevi students and teachers boycotted school to protest the government's religious education stand. Thousands marched in several Turkish cities holding up banners calling for a secular and science-based education system.\n\nPolice used water cannons to disperse thousands of people who marched in Izmir, the third-largest city in the country. Reports said at least 10 people were detained in five Turkish cities for organizing the boycott.\n\nThe country's national education advisory council has recommended more measures to add religious education and start at younger ages. This could be a hint of more things to come, because the council is dominated by a pro-government teachers union.\n\nPresident Erdogan is strongly backing a proposal to add required Ottoman language classes at high schools, but the proposal was later limited to religious schools only. Ottoman is an older version of Turkish, written in Arabic script. The language was abandoned after Ataturk introduced the Latin alphabet in 1928 to make Turkey more Western and modern.\n\nEducators who support the government say Turkey is going back to its cultural roots.  Education was going against Turkish culture and civilization, said Ali Yalcin. He's the deputy head of the pro-government teachers union which proposed many of the recommendations.\n\nYalcin denies schools are trying to force religion on students through elective classes. What schools are trying to do, he said, is open up religious education to students according to the wishes of the Turkish people.\n\n## Should Schools Have Religion Classes Or More Facilities?\n\nCritics say the government is focused on adding religion in schools, but it ignores the Turkish education system's serious failings. According to a report, Turkish students have done poorly in reading, mathematics and science. Turkey ranked 44th out of 65 countries in those subjects.\n\nYilmaz, the secretary of the teachers union, said the real problems in schools are being brushed aside. He said teachers have classes with 50 to 60 students. Schools have no labs, libraries or sports facilities, he added.\n\nReligious education does not mean students will grow more religious, said Abbas Guclu, an education expert. After taking their religion classes, young people will spend more time online, watching TV or on social media, he explained.\n\n\"It's not possible to control the youth of today,\" he said.'"
