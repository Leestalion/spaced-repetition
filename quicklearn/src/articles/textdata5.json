            "title": "Artist sketches a courtroom's many moods when cameras are not allowed",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES, Calif. - Mona Shafer Edwards is a courtroom sketch artist. She draws pictures of court trials that are used on television or in newspapers when cameras are not allowed in the courtroom.\n\nNot long ago, Edwards was at a big trial in Los Angeles. She sat near the jury, the group of people that listens to everything that goes on during a trial. They decide whether a person is guilty or innocent.\n\nEdwards removed a plastic bag bulging with pens and markers from her fancy purse. She never uses a pencil and does not erase. She set her drawing pad on her lap.\n\nThe judge joked that Edwards had made him look old in one sketch.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Edwards said, laughing. \"I'll do better.\"\n\n## Courtroom Sketch Artists Are Dwindling\n\nIn the courtroom, she drew quickly as Marion \"Suge\" Knight, who used to be a rap music businessman, came into the courtroom. Edwards drew his scowl and handcuffed hands.\n\nRich and famous people have their legal cases heard in Los Angeles courtrooms. Edwards has been there for more than 30 years, sketching former football player O.J. Simpson, Michael Jackson and many others.\n\nThere are not many sketch artists around today. Some have found work in courtrooms where cameras are not allowed, or with judges who do not want the distraction that the television news can bring.\n\nAs the Knight hearing ended, Edwards dashed outside to put the finishing touches on her sketches.\n\nShe taped the pictures onto a wall. Photographers took close-up images of the sketches, which would be used on television news programs.\n\n## She Knew She Could Do Better\n\nEdwards saw courtroom sketches on television news many years ago and knew she could do better.\n\n\"They were awful, just awful,\" she said. \"I told my husband, 'That's what I want to do. I can do that.'\"\n\nEdwards had been working for years drawing pictures for fancy clothing companies and stores. She realized that her skills in fashion could work in the courtroom.\n\nShe went to one station and showed someone her drawings. \"He told me 'You should stick with fashion,'\" Edwards said.\n\nNext was KNBC. The television station gave her a chance, sending her to a famous trial in 1979.\n\nEdwards said the way she works in court is always the same.\n\nShe first finds something about a person that stands out. It could be something like a hair style, lips or their nose. Then she studies the person's body language. She looks at posture and how their clothes fit. Next she draws the image in her mind, plans it out and starts the sketch.\n\nThe key is to capture the person's spirit, she said.\n\n## Trials Through The Centuries Have Been Sketched\n\nCourtroom sketches have a long history.\n\nAn artist sketched the Salem witch trials of 1692. Drawings also were made at the 1865 military trial of people involved in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThen Richard Bruno Hauptmann went on trial in 1935. He was charged with killing famous pilot Charles Lindbergh's son. News coverage of the trial was crazy. There were hidden news cameras, secret radio broadcasts and flashbulb bursts.\n\nThe way reporters covered that case led the American Bar Association to ask judges to not allow cameras and audio recording at trials, which they did for many years. The association represents lawyers in the United States. Some courts eventually loosened the rules, though others still do not allow cameras.\n\n## TV Cameras Nudge Sketch Artists\n\nO.J. Simpson's trial, where he was accused of killing his former wife and another man, was among the first to be shown live on television with TV cameras in the courtroom. Edwards said people thought it would be the end for courtroom artists.\n\nThe jury said Simpson was not guilty. Then people complained about the way news groups reported on the trial. Some people believe reporters went too far and the behavior of many others made judges less likely to allow cameras inside.\n\nRonald H. Rose is a retired Los Angeles judge. He said the presence of cameras changes the behavior of those involved in a trial. They might get very nervous or act out for the cameras. It can make it harder for courts to find the correct ruling on a case.\n\nEdwards can easily blend in and bring the feeling of the entire room into her sketches.\n\n\"She's the public eye in the courtroom,\" Rose said.'"

            "text": "\tST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - A new Andy Warhol exhibit features self-portraits taken with the Instagram of the 1970s -- the Polaroid camera.\n\nYes, it seems, Warhol liked selfies long before they were trendy.\n\nThere's Warhol posing with a skull, Warhol looking moody in black and white, and Warhol squeezed in between former Beatles member John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. Bonus points: celebrity selfie! Big in the 1970s, the Polaroid had self-developing film that let people see photos instantly.\n\nThe exhibit may be full of 1970s clothing and disco glitter. But Warhol's take on fame feels modern. It fits right in with 21st century America's love of reality TV and celebrities.\n\n## Warhol's Red Self-Portrait\n\n\"Warhol: Art. Fame. Mortality.\" includes more than 100 artworks and films on loan from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Warhol, who said that \"everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes,\" was born and raised in Pittsburgh. He died in 1987. His paintings now sell for more than $100 million each. The exhibit opens to the public Saturday and runs through April 27.\n\nThe exhibit's a first for The Dali, an entire museum devoted to the surrealist master's work. Surrealism was an artistic style that featured strange, dream-like artworks. Salvador Dali was a Spanish artist who died in 1989. He was known for his paintings of things like melting clocks.\n\nIn 2011, the museum moved into a new building along the city's waterfront. The Warhol exhibit is its first special exhibit in its new home, said museum director Hank Hine.\n\n\"This is totally appropriate to the (memory) of Dali,\" said Hine.\n\nThe exhibit features some of Warhol's famous silkscreens pictures, including a red self-portrait taken a year before he died. Silkscreening is a special printing method. It uses a woven screen to print a picture. T-shirts and posters are often printed by silkscreening.\n\nThere are several pictures of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, the wife of President John Kennedy, and versions of his Campbell's Soup can paintings. Warhol was known for painting Campbell's Soup cans. There are also TV monitors set up to show the artist's \"screen tests.\" These are short films of a single person against a plain background.\n\n## Screen Tests For Selfies\n\nDali and Warhol had much in common, Hine said. The exhibit contains photos of the men goofing around in a hotel room.\n\nDali was a generation older - born in 1904 - than Warhol, who was born in 1928. But both fascinated the public with their attention-getting and sometimes controversial works of art.\n\nWarhol often visited Dali when Dali stayed in a New York hotel. According to one story, Dali tied Warhol to a spinning board and splattered paint over him. Warhol also made one of his famous \"screen tests\" of Dali. Warhol told Dali not to move during the three-minute filming.\n\nDali ignored Warhol's instruction to sit still and walked away.\n\nThe exhibit not only shows Warhol's screen tests. It also give people a chance to do their own.\n\nThe show has a copy of his screen test set where visitors can sit in front of a camera. They then send their \"tests\" to Twitter and Facebook. So, everyone can have their 15 minutes of fame on social media.\n\nWarhol would have approved.'"

            "title": "New photo, new clues to Earhart mystery",
            "text": "\tMIAMI - The photo of famous female pilot Amelia Earhart was taken on June 1, 1937, in the shadows before dawn. It shows her plane on a Miami runway moments before she took off on her doomed flight around the world.\n\nThe picture, though, contains a strange detail. There's a shiny silver patch that doesn't show up on any of the other pictures of Earhart's plane.\n\nCould it be a clue to what happened when Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean three months later?\n\nLongtime Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie thinks so. He thinks the silvery patch is proof that the plane had a repair. He hopes to use a computer to link it to a scrap of metal that possibly broke off Earhart's plane. The piece of metal was found on a tiny Pacific island in the area where Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.\n\nGillespie hopes to match the photo to the wreckage. Someone would have to admit \"that Noonan and Earhart weren't lost at sea, but made it to the island,\" Gillespie said. Gillespie is the head of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR). The group investigates missing plane cases and finds old planes.\n\nIf Gillespie is successful, it would solve one of the greatest mysteries in the history of airplanes.\n\n## The Missing Window Mystery\n\nEarhart was one of the world's most famous women when she and Noonan attempted to be the first to fly around the world. She was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic. She was also a feminist before the word was invented. Earhart wanted women to be allowed to become anything they wanted.\n\nTheir trip didn't go well from the start. First, Earhart and Noonan landed at the wrong airport in Miami. The landing was rough and the plane needed to be fixed.\n\nOne of the windows was removed in the back of the plane. That window can clearly be seen in photos of Earhart's plane taken at the start of her trip.\n\nBut in the photo shot on June 1, 1937, the window is gone. It is replaced by that odd silvery plate.\n\nThe window must have been broken by the hard landing in Miami, Gillespie said. \"So they just took it out and patched the (plane) instead.\"\n\n## The Antenna Was Next To Go\n\nThen a month later, a radio antenna on the bottom of her plane tore away.\n\nNineteen hours later, she radioed, \"We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you.\" Messages continued for more than an hour before Earhart gave her location: \"We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. ... We are now running north and south.\"\n\nAfter that was silence.\n\nRescue ships began looking for Earhart right away. Search planes passed over Gardner Island 400 miles away. They spotted signs that someone had recently been there, but the planes moved on.\n\nLater, British records showed a human skeleton and a woman's shoe had been found on Gardner Island. The bones disappeared long ago.\n\nIn 1991, during an expedition to Gardner, TIGHAR found a scrap of aluminum with rows of holes. The scrap looked like it was torn from the outer skin of an airplane.\n\nTests showed the scrap was made from a material used in all American planes made in the 1930s. But the pattern of holes didn't match the holes on Earhart's Lockheed Electra.\n\nInvestigators wanted to see if the scrap could have come from the plane's patch. They began looking at pictures. Only one shot offered a good view of the patch - the 1937 photo.\n\nIf we can match that hole pattern in the photo, Gillespie said, \"I don't see how anybody can argue against this anymore.\"\n\n## Many Heard Distress Calls\n\nGillespie thinks Earhart landed her plane on a coral reef off Gardner Island and radioed for help.\n\nAfter she disappeared, more than 100 shortwave radio listeners reported distress calls from a woman identifying herself as Earhart. At the time, they were considered fakes. But Gillespie believes some of them may have been real.\n\nOne of the reports came from a Florida teenager named Betty Klenck. She died recently at the age of 92.\n\nThree days after the plane went down, Betty heard a call on her radio from someone calling herself Earhart. For three hours, the teenager listened, taking notes. The woman asked for help. She said: \"Oh, if they could hear me.\"\n\nOfficials weren't interested in the notebook and thought Betty made up the story. Yet the notebook contains information Betty couldn't possibly have known. The woman may really have been Earhart, calling from Gardner Island.'"

            "text": "\tWillie Bailey twirled his partner on the dance floor. Soul music played as the two dancers bopped back and forth. Tonight was special for Bailey because his dance partner was his 7-year-old daughter.\n\n\"I feel so happy,\" Bailey's daughter, Taniya, said after they stopped moving. \"I feel pretty.\"\n\nFather-daughter dances like these are very popular on Chicago's South Side. The parties celebrate how important fathers are in the lives of their young girls. The evening is also a fun reason to get dressed up.\n\n\"I wouldn't miss this for the world,\" said Bailey. \"I love it because it gives us a chance to spend time together, just us.\"\n\n## A Special Bond\n\nFather-daughter dances can also promote the special bond between fathers and their daughters. Over the years, African-Americans have started to host dances to give dads the chance to show their daughters how much they care.\n\nHaley Elementary Academy is organizing a dance of its own. School leaders will hold their first father-daughter dance later this year.\n\nMany black kids don't grow up with both a mom and dad in their lives. They are being raised in single-parent homes. Still, these dances show that many fathers are still involved in the lives of their kids, and that they care.\n\nThe relationship a girl has with her father is important because it can affect the relationships she has with men as she grows up.\n\n## Male Role Models\n\nKelly Fair has a mentoring organization called Polished Pebbles. The group connects young black girls with successful adult women who can offer advice about school and work. Fair said it is also important for the girls to realize how men affect their lives.\n\n\"There are men out here who are responsible, loving, trusting, caring and doing good things,\" said Fair. \"We want our girls to see them.\"\n\nPolished Pebbles also hosts a father-daughter dance in Chicago. Girls can bring their fathers, uncles, cousins or brothers to serve as male role models. Fair finds volunteer \"dads\" for girls who do not have another man to invite.\n\nThe event is light-hearted and fun. The men introduce themselves to the girls and play group games. They do not dance one-on-one. Instead, they line dance, play musical chairs and boogie down a soul train line.\n\nAt the father-daughter dance that Bailey and Taniya attended, about 70 men spent the afternoon with the special girls in their lives. Most men were there with their young daughters. Some men brought nieces, cousins and girls from their neighborhoods so they could party, too.\n\n## \"He Dances Weird\"\n\nOnce the dance started, Joe Dunford, a dad, floated from side to side, bouncing his shoulders and nodding to the music. His daughter did her own dance moves in front of him. He reached out for her hands and pulled her arms into smooth movements, training her to dance.\n\n\"It's a little embarrassing, but it's fun,\" said Miranda, 8. \"He dances weird. I like it though.\"\n\nThis was Dunford's first time at a father-daughter dance. It meant a lot to him to be there. He wants to teach Miranda from an early age what to expect from a man and how she should be treated.\n\nBailey and his daughter turned the dance into a special day. They had breakfast together and got dressed for the dance at his mother-in-law's house. They took photos in their outfits. Taniya wore a tan gown with a pearl necklace. Bailey wore his Sunday best with a cap and tan blazer.\n\n\"She loves to get dressed up and look pretty,\" Bailey said. \"I love to do what makes her happy and keeps her smiling. Our bond is unbreakable.\"\n\nAfter the dance, they went to Taniya's favorite restaurant, Red Lobster.'"

            "text": "\tST. LOUIS - A museum in Missouri is trying to gather images and items from the protests in Ferguson.\n\nThe Missouri History Museum is collecting items that show the unrest that followed the August shooting death of Michael Brown. The 18-year-old Brown was an African-American. He was shot by a white officer of the Ferguson police.\n\nSome images are already a part of Missouri history. They include street-artist paintings on boards protecting store windows and signs saying, \"Hands Up. Don't Shoot.\"\n\nThe St. Louis museum is not just gathering physical objects. It is also collecting Facebook and Twitter posts and even cellphone videos. The museum is also asking for protesters, residents and police to tell their stories. These are called oral histories.\n\n## A Piece Of Local History\n\nThe shooting was followed by protests and violence. Police and minority communities did not trust each other. The museum wants to show people in the future what was seen and thought while it all happened.\n\nThe items are not being collected for one exhibition at the museum. They will mostly be saved so they can be studied. The goal is to collect history as it happens.\n\n\"This is a rare example of being at a point where history is made all around you,\" said Chris Gordon of the museum, which is in St. Louis.\n\nThe museum has regular exhibits. It also has a public library that holds documents, objects and written words from events going back more than 200 years.\n\n## Protests Resulted In Violence\n\nBrown was fatally shot on Aug. 9 after a confrontation with a police Officer Darren Wilson. Brown was unarmed. Some witnesses said he was trying to surrender. Wilson said Brown was threatening his life.\n\nA day after the shooting, protesters flooded the streets near the site. Several businesses were damaged.\n\nAnger grew in the community for months. It got worse on Nov. 24 after a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, Wilson with a crime. Furious protesters swarmed streets across the St. Louis area. It led to a nationwide movement protesting how the police treat some people, particularly minorities. Some protests became violent. A dozen businesses around Ferguson were burned down and others were damaged.\n\nTV news media traveled to the protests because of the shootings and unrest. The videos and pictures they took of armored police facing off with angry protesters were seen around the world.\n\n## Items Of Protest And Support\n\nGordon said the museum has already collected T-shirts, protest signs and buttons. Photos have been taken of a memorial for Brown in the street where he was killed. The museum is trying to save street art before it is painted over. Wood boards covering store windows still show messages like, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to Justice everywhere.\"\n\nOn one chilly morning, 60-year-old Carol Snyder of Pennsylvania walked along South Florissant Road. She snapped photos of the street art with her phone.\n\nSnyder stood in front of a piece of wood painted with the words \"Hands Up Let's Pray.\" She felt a mixture of sadness and hope.\n\n\"I do hope for a brighter future,\" she said. \"I do hope for peace for the people here in Ferguson and throughout the United States.\"\n\nSome objects have been hard for Gordon to collect. He has not found an empty tear gas canister or rubber bullet. Both were used by police when the protests turned angry. He is also searching for buttons, T-shirts and signs showing support for Wilson, but they are hard to find because there were not many demonstrations in the officer's favor.\n\nIt is unclear if any of the items will ever be shown in the museum - but the goal is really to save history.\n\n\"Our hope is to preserve this for future generations so they can get a clearer picture of what actually happened,\" Gordon said.'"

            "text": "\tTEHRAN, Iran - An Internet video of six young Iranian men and women dancing to the hit pop song \"Happy\" by Pharrell Williams appeared on YouTube. They were arrested shortly after the video appeared. Iran's president doesn't seem to support the arrests. Yet, there are members of Iran's government who do. The arrests show how far they will go to halt Western influences on Iran's culture.\n\nPeople outside [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) quickly criticized the arrests. Calls for freedom for the jailed youths zipped around social media Wednesday. Williams tweeted: \"It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.\"\n\nA tweet posted Wednesday evening on President Hassan Rouhani's Twitter account seemed to address the arrests. Yet, it didn't mention them directly.\n\n\"#Happiness is our people's right,\" it said. \"We shouldn't be too hard on behaviors caused by joy.\"\n\nThere is some debate if Rouhani actually is the one posting on Twitter.\n\n## \"Why Are We So Shaky?\"\n\nThe case was a reminder of the power struggle in Iran's government. The country's hard-liners are determined to keep things as they are. Iran's moderates, however, are trying to push through change. Some are seeking improved relations with Western Europe and the U.S. Others just want fewer crackdowns, like the video arrests.\n\nHard-liners are increasingly challenging Rouhani. The president was elected last year. He succeeded Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a more hard-line president.\n\nThe challenges come as the country is working out a deal with other nations that will allow it to keep using nuclear energy. There is fear Iran could use nuclear energy to make powerful weapons.\n\nAs recently as Saturday, Rouhani voiced support for open use of the Internet. At the moment, Iran tightly regulates Internet use. Sites such as YouTube and Facebook are blocked by the government. However, many young Iranians find ways around the controls. Some use tools that make it seem as if they are surfing the Internet from another country.\n\n\"We should see the cyber world as an opportunity,\" Rouhani told the official Iranian news agency. \"Why are we so shaky? Why don't we trust our youth?\"\n\n## Wants Greater Cultural Openness\n\nHard-liners accuse Rouhani of failing to stop the spread of what they consider \"decadent\" Western culture in Iran. Last week, hard-liners marched against women dressing in modern fashions and not wearing the \"hijab.\" Many muslim women wear the hijab, a veil covering the hair.\n\nRouhani seeks greater social and cultural openness. Yet, hard-liners say the government should be tough on those who challenge their traditional views of Islamic practices. They accuse Rouhani of being too tolerant.\n\nThe dancing Iranians would seem right at home in the West. Fans have posted similar videos from around the world, showing people dancing down streets.\n\nBut in Iran, some believe videos like these help spread Western culture. Iranian law bans women from dancing in public or appearing outside without covering their hair with the hijab. The government also blocks some websites.\n\nThe video that got them in trouble shows hip twentysomethings hamming it up for the camera in sunglasses and silly clothes on Tehran rooftops and in alleyways. One of the bearded men goofily dips his female dancing partner.\n\nNone of the three women in the video wears a hijab.\n\n## Crackdowns By Hard-Liners\n\nThe video was posted online several weeks ago. It includes the participants' first names in the credits. They describe themselves as Williams fans, adding: \"'Happy' was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it.\"\n\nTehran Police Chief Hossein Sajedinia confirmed the arrests on state TV last Tuesday. The TV report blurred images from the video and then showed the six with their backs turned toward the camera.\n\n\"They were identified and arrested within six hours,\" Sajedinia said.\n\nOn the TV broadcast, Sajedinia gave a warning to Iranian young people. He said police will approach those who go against Islamic practices.\n\nThe last time there was a crackdown on music was on Dec. 2, 2013, when Iran's Morality Police temporarily arrested popular rapper Amir Tataloo, whose songs authorities consider inappropriate. He was released two days later.'"

            "text": "\tSinger Pharrell Williams looked stunning in his photo. He was shot from the side wearing a proud Native American war bonnet.\n\nBut Williams is not, as far as anyone knew, Native American.\n\nThe picture appeared on the July cover of fashion magazine Elle UK June 5. The angry backlash on social media followed soon after. Critics on Twitter used the hashtag \"#NotHappy,\" a joke about Williams' hit single, \"Happy\".\n\nWilliams quickly apologized. \"I respect and honor every kind of race, background and culture,\" he said. \"I am genuinely sorry.\"\n\nHeaddresses have deep meaning for Native Americans. But lately a lot of people who aren't Native have been playing dress-up in them. This has brought back a subject that has been argued for a long time. Is it right to take things from other cultures and use them however you want?\n\n## Being Heard On Social Media\n\nWhile they are only 2 percent of the U.S. population, Native Americans have a strong and bold presence on social media, Vincent Schilling explained. Schilling is a Native American journalist. \"Our presence is making change.\" For years, \"the only voice we had was to go out and hold up a sign and say we're frustrated. But now, for the first time, the native voice is being heard on social media.\"\n\nNow, when people use Native American culture in hurtful ways, the news spreads far and wide. In June, headdresses made headlines during a San Francisco Giants baseball game. Security guards stepped in after a Native American man and woman approached a group of nonnative men. The men had brought a fake, plastic headdress to the game.\n\nThe incident got attention both in online discussions and in the news. Soon, the Giants changed their list of what can get fans thrown out of the stadium. The Giants added \"culturally insensitive\" clothing to hurtful language and abusive behavior.\n\nAnd Native American activists say a music festival in Canada took a historic step. It banned people from wearing feathered headdresses at the concerts.\n\n## Reaching Out On YouTube\n\nSchilling is Akwesasne Mohawk. He saw so many examples of headdresses being used in a disrespectful way that he made a YouTube video last fall. The video is called \"What Is Native American Misappropriation?\"\n\nSchilling begins: \"What we're seeing now is ... what people are calling native hipsters. And seeing these young people in headdresses and poetic fashionable poses ... it's really upsetting a lot of people.\"\n\nHe adds, \"It's not like I'm mad at these people. It's just that it hurts. I feel physical pain in my heart when I see these things.\"\n\nThe feathered war bonnet is the headdress Williams was wearing. It is what many people typically think of when they think of Native Americans.\n\nThe war bonnets are worn mostly by Northern and Southern Plains tribes. Native people make the crown by hand. They use feathers from eagles.\n\n## Feathers Must Be Earned\n\nSuch headdresses can be seen at the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation's yearly powwow. Every summer hundreds of Native American dancers and drummers from across the country travel to northeast Kansas for the event.\n\nThe dancers' colorful costumes create a breathtaking scene. The leatherwork, beading and quillwork of their clothing is all done by hand. Some of their custom headdresses are worth thousands of dollars.\n\nDennis Zotigh works at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. The war bonnet was their symbol of leadership, he said. \"Each of those feathers was earned and shows their position of leadership,\" Zotigh said. \"So not everybody had the right to wear these. And they were only worn for special occasions.\"\n\nTom Spotted Horse sometimes sees a Native American wearing a war bonnet. \"That tells me this person has met a specific level of distinction,\" he said.\n\nSpotted Horse said his great-great grandfather was buried with his war bonnet.\n\n## \"Not Real War Bonnets\"\n\nIt's like \"the modern warrior who earns a medal for their service during wartime,\" Zotigh said. \"For a person to wear a war bonnet who didn't earn it would be the exact same thing as somebody wearing a Medal of Honor who did not earn it.\"\n\nDana Warrington, a 34-year-old dancer from Keshena, Wisconsin, who is half Potawatomi, half Menominee, does not think it's right for nonnatives to wear headdresses. But he tends to give artists like Williams and others a pass.\n\n\"I don't think they do it in such a disrespectful way,\" said Warrington. \"I don't think they do it with that intention.\"\n\nSpotted Horse doesn't get worked up either over by what happened with Williams. He said he's seen it before and believes it will keep happening.\n\n\"To me, when a nonnative or whoever is wearing them, I know in my heart they're not real war bonnets. They're the ones you can buy for $300 and $400,\" he said.\n\nSo he looks at the situation as almost funny. \"Let's face it,\" he said. \"As Native Americans we are living in a dominant society, a society dominated by nonnatives, and it's going to be like that for a long time.\"\n\nHe just thinks nonnatives in headdresses look silly.'"

It is called, of course, Hello Kitty Con 2014.\n\nHowever, Hello Kitty is not as popular as she used to be.\n\nFor years, Hello Kitty was the best-selling character in Japan, says Character Databank, a company that ranks the most valuable cartoon characters.

Sanrio says half the sales at its stores are Hello Kitty items.\n\nSanrio, though, doesn't want to rely on just Hello Kitty to make money.\n\nSanrio is searching for the next cute sensation. Its artists have been busy creating new characters. None of them has come close to Hello Kitty's success.\n\nSanrio recently said it will open a Hello Kitty cafe in California. The company is also launching a new product line called Hello Kitty Men, which will include Hello Kitty men's underwear and T-shirts.\n\nSome think her simple design is the key to her popularity. Kitty's face has no mouth, expression or personality. Fans can imagine whatever they want about her.\n\nRoland Kelts, who wrote \"Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Invaded the U.S,\" said that Hello Kitty is almost like a blank sheet of paper. She is whatever people want her to be.\n\n\"If you had a lousy day ... you come home to Hello Kitty on your sofa, and she sympathizes,\" Kelts said. \"On the other hand, if you got a raise or met someone and hit it off, Kitty feels good for you.\"\n\n## Cuteness In Any Language\n\nShe became popular in the United States about the same time Americans became interested in eating sushi and reading anime comics. Some scholars consider her the Number 1 example of kawaii, Japanese for cuteness. Kawaii has become a big part of popular culture in Japan.\n\nEvery so often, Sanrio tries to bring attention to the kitty. It organizes events like the convention and the museum exhibit at Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles.\n\nThe exhibit has attracted such big crowds that the museum had to hire extra workers.\n\n## What's Not To Like?\n\nLike many high-profile stars, though, not everyone loves Hello Kitty.\n\nSome slam her as a girl with no opinions. She can never talk back since she has no mouth. At least one blog is dedicated solely to her.\n\nInside the museum exhibit a DJ is wearing Hello Kitty headphones. Longtime fan Gianfranco Ocampo is there. The 23-year-old art student said he collected Hello Kitty dolls as a kid. He also has attended Hello Kitty tea parties.\n\nDavi Marchi, who is with Sanrio, can't exactly explain Hello Kitty's appeal.\n\n\"If I could explain it,\" he said, \"we would have 30 huge characters.\"'"

            "text": "\tKINGSTON, Jamaica - Renaldo Brown is practicing his flute under the trees. The 12-year-old is barefoot and dressed in donated clothes. But Brown is a student at a Jamaican music school famous for teaching many of this island's top musicians.\n\n\"It's challenging but I like it. I'm getting better 'cause I've been practicing nearly every day for two years,\" said the serious boy. Brown is from the tough Jamaican city of Spanish Town.\n\nRenaldo is among two dozen boys at Alpha Boys' School who are discovering a new world through music. The boys from poor backgrounds have all been placed there by family courts. Some of the boys are orphans. Others are placed at the home because of neglect, abuse or because their parents can't control them.\n\nAlpha has been a boarding school run by Catholic nuns since the late 19th century. Most of Jamaica's world-class music has come out of Alpha. The school offers hope to at-risk kids. Year after year, Alpha graduates leave Kingston to bring the sounds of Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae music to the world.\n\n## \"Whole Business Of Music\"\n\nNow the school is being squeezed. Rising costs and shrinking state support make it difficult to run. The money crunch has gotten so bad that the nuns say they will have to stop letting students live at the school later this year. Alpha's place in Jamaican music may not matter.\n\nThe school is building up its own money-making businesses. It recently started an \"Alpha Wear\" clothing line. There is also an Internet radio station. It draws 60,000 people monthly. Sister Susan Frazer said the online radio program isn't bringing in money yet. But it is expected to make some through people paying to support the station and through advertising.\n\nFrazer said Alpha also plans to expand and update its training for young students. They want to make sure the famous music program survives.\n\nBut students will be taught more, she said. \"It won't be just instrument playing, but rather the whole business of music.\"\n\nStudents at the school are taught self-discipline and pride while they study music. They learn to read music and understand harmony and composition. Alpha currently has about 85 kids, and 25 of them are in the music program. Other students take the school's more traditional classes like woodworking and tailoring.\n\nMany former students have moved past rough starts in life to become top musicians. The four founding members of the important band The Skatalites are graduates of Alpha. So are the late jazz pioneer Joe Harriott and dance hall deejay Yellowman. Many others have found work as strong backup players and session musicians. They work in Jamaica and other countries around the world.\n\n\"If you go to France, you'll see Alpha boys playing music professionally. You go to Germany or New York, you'll see Alpha boys,\" said Winston \"Sparrow\" Martin. He is the school's longtime band teacher. He's also an Alpha graduate. He has provided a musical education to many boys at the school while working on his own international recording career.\n\n## Upbeat Ska And Rocksteady\n\nClassical, jazz and folk music have always been a part of the school's program. But in the 1950s, the Caribbean island heard American rhythm and blues through distant radio signals picked up at night. Alpha students changed the music. They took their trumpets, trombones and other instruments and created upbeat ska. That music later grew into rocksteady and reggae.\n\nAlpha's music program dates back to 1892. Back then, boys played in a fife and drum corps. The corps evolved into a famed brass band under the school's longtime leader, Sister Mary Ignatius Davies. She supported her students' musical talents for years. Davies died in 2003 at age 81.\n\nThe current crop of Alpha boys are excited about the future. On a recent afternoon, band members practiced under a tall building. It was full of trumpets, saxophones and other instruments, some new and others battered and worn.\n\nRenaldo played his flute in a circle with other advanced musicians, including a keyboardist and several horn players. During a break, Renaldo and most of his classmates said they dream of becoming pro musicians.\n\n\"A lot of other people from here have become musicians,\" he said with a half-smile, looking down at his bare feet. \"Well, I hope I can, too.\"'"

            "text": "\tPOWELL, Wyo. - On this moonlit autumn night, cars arrive at Wyoming's last drive-in theater. Pokey Heny is waiting there ready for another evening of entertainment in this small town.\n\nHeny, 52, is the owner of the American Dream Drive-in. She collects $15 from each vehicle as they enter. She greets people by their first names, telling a 4-year-old girl she likes her stuffed hippo, named Martha. Then a mother and daughter roll up in an old truck. Heny lets them in for 10 bucks.\n\nShe looks out toward the big screen in the night. She sees families on top of cars, in lawn chairs and the backs of trucks. Dogs crouch between toddlers buried under wool blankets. And she smiles because she knows she's helping to preserve an important custom in this town. Powell is a town of ranchers and has just 6,000 people.\n\nHeny's business first opened in 1949 as Wyoming's first drive-in. But, the future is in doubt as Heny battles Hollywood movie studios seeking to increase their profits. In the background lurks the shrinking popularity of drive-ins as they close one by one. Hers is the last one standing in Wyoming.\n\n## Won't Let It Flicker Out\n\nThis year, Hollywood switches to a digital format, replacing film at drive-ins across the country. Old movies had film on rolls that were put onto projectors. That left Heny with a problem - buy a digital projector or close down.\n\nThe digital projector cost her $80,000. That's what she paid for the whole theater in 2004. At the first showing, the new machine stopped working. She had to tell 75 cars full of customers there would be no picture show that night.\n\nBut Heny sticks by her bet. \"I'm investing in the town's future,\" she says. \"So many businesses have closed, the bowling alley and video store. If I let this one go, it wasn't ever coming back.\"\n\nDrive-ins have been failing for years. Since the top of their popularity in the 1950s, nine-tenths have closed. Their numbers have tumbled from a high of 4,063 to just 350 this year, says Kipp Sherer, who tracks the drive-in business on the website Drive-ins.com. Today, Alaska, Delaware and Louisiana have no drive-ins at all. Maryland, Rhode Island and Mississippi each have one. Wyoming once had 30.\n\nSherer says that for small communities it's one of the last places \"where families can watch a movie and be themselves.\" It's an evening out \"that doesn't break the bank.\"\n\n## Holding Onto Yesterday\n\nHeny wants to keep it that way. Though she updated to digital, she tries to keep everything else as it was when she was a child. She plays only family movies. She won't show slasher flicks because she doesn't want passing drivers to see bloody scenes on the big screen.\n\nAt the 7:15 p.m. start time for \"Monsters University,\" a crowd waits outside the snack bar. Old records decorate the bar. Old style candy, such as Junior Mints, Dots and Hot Tamales, along with dill pickles on a stick, are for sale. There's bug spray to keep away hungry mosquitoes.\n\nSuddenly, sound comes out of 1940s speakers that stand next to parking spaces. Two girls tell customers to tune to FM station 95.1 for sound. Some nights, bands of 6-year-olds cluster outside the projector shack. They make shadow puppets over the opening credits. \"Just kids being kids,\" Heny says.\n\nThe nation's first outdoor movie theater opened in New Jersey. In 1933, Richard Hollingshead placed a Kodak projector on top of his car to play \"Wives Beware,\" a movie about a no-good car salesman. The screen was nailed to two trees. A radio provided sound.\n\n## Her Own American Dream\n\nYears later, Paul's Drive-in opened on an old hay field in Wyoming. Besides movies, it offered pony rides along with boat rides in a small pond. A storm blew down the screen in 1955. But, the year after that the drive-in returned. The theater charged 50 cents for grownups and 9 cents for children back then.\n\nIn the 1970s, its name changed to the Vali Drive-in. The theater was the center of Powell's teen social life. \"The girls came here because this is where the boys were,\" said Heny's sister Diana Fulton, who worked the snack bar as a youth. She now helps Heny run the business. \"I met guys - that's why I worked here.\"\n\nThen Heny took over the theater. In 2004, she changed the name to the American Dream Drive-in. \"It really is the American dream to be your own boss,\" she said. \"And there aren't that many female small-business owners in Wyoming.\" Most weekends she earns $3,000 which includes money made from the snack bar.\n\nLike most nights, she's the last to leave, switching off the marquee out by the mural of the American flag. For a moment, she stands there, watching the lights dim on Wyoming's last drive-in theater.'"

            "title": "Investigation finds 139 pieces of stolen art in Dutch museums",
            "text": "\tAMSTERDAM - A major investigation of art hanging in Dutch museums just concluded. The goal was to find out if any of the art was once stolen by the Nazis during the 1930s and 1940s. The results were surprising: the investigation found 139 works that may have been looted, or stolen. They include ones by important artists like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday by the museums was a bombshell. It also raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections after World War II? It also suggests that even more looted art may show up in countries that have not done such investigations.\n\n\"These objects are either thought or known to have been\" taken by the Germans during the war, said Siebe Weide. Or they were sold by owners who were forced against their will to sell them, he said. Weide runs the Netherlands Museums Association.\n\nThe art included 69 paintings. One of them is French artist Henri Matisse's 1921 \"Odalisque.\" It is a painting of a half-nude reclining woman. The painting hangs in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. The museum is very popular with tourists.\n\n## Paintings, Sculptures And Drawings\n\nAll Dutch museums with art from before the war participated in the review. They have identified the names of 20 people whose art was taken and linked them with 61 of the artworks. The museums are trying to find relatives of the former owners, including those of Jewish art dealer Albert Stern. He is the man who owned the Matisse.\n\nThe examination also found other paintings by well-known painters. Other pieces uncovered included drawings, like one by Paul Klee. There were also sculptures, old collectors pieces and Jewish ceremonial objects.\n\nOne painting had been purchased in good faith by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002. The 1627 painting had changed hands many times over the years. Then the latest Dutch examination revealed it had belonged to a Jewish woman. It was sold by a bank. That bank had worked with the Nazis during the war.\n\nIn 1998, there was an international conference on looted art.  The Washington meeting found past attempts to return looted art didn't go far enough. Attendees from 44 nations set up the Washington Principles. They declared that \"every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been\" taken by the Nazis, and have it returned.\n\n## Second Examination By The Dutch\n\nMany American and British museums have already thoroughly looked at their collections. They have returned looted art. But nothing has been done across the two countries. In Germany, a government-led, nationwide examination is happening now.\n\nThe Dutch examination was the second in the Netherlands. The first one in 2006 focused only on works that were bought and sold during the war.\n\nSome wondered what took so long.\n\n\"While I applaud the Dutch for doing this, I also have to say: where were you all this time?\" said Chris Marinello, a London-based lawyer. He helps people in looted art cases. He said many countries should be doing more to help recover looted art. The United States is one of them.\n\n## Website Seeks More Information\n\nBut some countries are less willing than others. Russia does not accept the Washington Principles. It calls art taken during World War II its rightful \"trophies.\" Switzerland endorses the principles in theory, but has not conducted thorough research and ignores the idea that looted art could be hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.\n\nThe Dutch Museums Association launched a website on Tuesday. The site will show what the museums have discovered so far, and ask for more information about looted artwork. It will help relatives or others in filing claims. An English translation of the Dutch website is coming in 2014.\n\nInvestigator Rudi Ekkart admitted it's still possible that more looted artwork will be uncovered in the Netherlands. He said the museums' research was not complete and new research ideas - such as the website - will lead to new findings. In addition, there are likely pieces still held in homes that will be eventually detected.\n\nBut \"you'll never again have a hundred at once,\" Ekkart said.'"

            "title": "LA to become \"mural capital of the world\" after ban lifted",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles City Council lifted a decade-long ban on murals.  From now on, large public paintings on outdoor walls will be permitted. The change marked a major victory for city artists.\n\nArtists had long argued that the law made no sense in a city with such a rich tradition of street art. Murals have recorded generations of city history. Everything from the mid-20th century struggles of Latinos to images of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics showed up in the colorful pictures.\n\nThe decision comes after years of debate. Now, said mural-supporter Isabel Rojas-Williams, the city can once again become the \"mural capital of the world.\"\n\nNew rules will seek to work out a compromise between different goals. The city's tradition of murals will be revived. But neighborhoods that don't want the large artworks will be able to ask the city for a local ban. And there are regulations designed to stop the spread of advertising disguised as art.\n\n## Pop Star's Mural Banned\n\nIt was that last concern which led to the ban 10 years ago. The city first banned only murals that advertised stores and products. Advertisers then sued the city. They argued that it wasn't fair that artists could create murals when businesses couldn't. So officials decided to ban all new murals.\n\n\"It's been a long 10 years,\" said Nyla Arslanian, president of the Hollywood Arts Council. \"We have in Hollywood some of the most beloved and internationally known murals. And it's about time that we have more.\"\n\nNot all murals were treated equally in what artists call the \"dark ages\" of the ban. Some were permitted by the city. Car wash owner Ben Forat encountered no problems when he put up a 75-foot-long painting.\n\nThe same was true for downtown artist Robert Vargas, who painted a picture of a mariachi band. And for young muralist Levi Ponce.\n\nBut when pop star Chris Brown put up murals of 8-foot-high fanged creatures outside his home things were different. Neighbors complained strongly. Within weeks the city had forced the singer to remove the cartoonish scene.\n\n## Rules Control Advertising\n\nUnder the new rules murals will be permitted in business and industrial zones. But in residential zones -- that is, areas mostly full of private homes -- murals won't be allowed without permission from the city.\n\nArtists will have to register their project with the city and pay $60. Commercial messages are prohibited and works must remain for at least two years. These last two rules are part of the city's effort to control advertising.\n\nCouncilmen Paul Koretz and Bob Blumenfield voted against the new measure. Both are afraid that neighborhoods where many people don't want murals may still end up getting them.\n\nKoretz represents parts of the Westside and parts of the San Fernando Valley. He said people in those areas have told him they don't support the new rules. They worry about the murals' appearance. And they also worry that murals will attract graffiti and become \"God-awful eyesores.\"\n\nBlumenfield said some people are concerned about what kinds of images might be allowed. They are afraid a giant picture might scare their children. He wasn't saying such fears made sense, he explained, but some people were worried about it.\n\n## Taking Art To The Walls\n\nSeveral artists argued that the new rules still don't give them enough freedom. Muralist Kent Twitchell said he was disappointed that murals wouldn't be allowed on single-family homes. Twitchell is world-famous for his mural of actor Steve McQueen, which he painted on the side of a two-story home.\n\nLifting the ban was good, he said after the vote on Aug. 28. \"But they've made it illegal for people to decorate their homes as they have for decades.\"\n\nHe said there were no mural regulations when he painted the McQueen piece. \"We were a free country then.\"\n\nMurals became very popular in Los Angeles during the 1970s. Artists took to walls to express their thoughts about political and social issues.\n\nIt was a culture that just suddenly sprang up, Rojas-Williams said. \"And it all happened at the same time without the artists knowing each other.\"\n\nAccording to Councilman Gil Cedillo, who represents mural-rich areas of the Eastside, murals are part of the \"social and cultural and historic fabric of the city. We should recognize that.\"'"

            "text": "\tEveryone dislikes some kind of music, of course. But are there people out there who just don't get much out of _any_ music? In other words, are there people who simply aren't moved by music that hits others in the heart?\n\nA new study published on Thursday says the answer is yes.\n\nThis finding was made by a team of scientists from Spain and Canada. They had been working on measuring how much pleasure people get from listening to music. To their surprise, they found that one out of every 20 people they studied claim to get no pleasure at all from music.\n\nSo they followed up by testing 30 more people. Those who said they took the least pleasure in music also showed the least emotion, or feelings, when listening. These people showed little emotion even when listening to pieces they had chosen themselves. Emotion was measured by monitoring changes in heart rate and sweat on subjects' skin.\n\n## No Pleasure From Music\n\n\"They were not just saying so,\" said the study's co-author, psychologist Josep Marco Pallares. He's a scientist who studies the brain and human behavior. Their physical responses matched \"with what they were saying.\"\n\nIt was already known that there are people who can't understand music well. About one in every 25 people has what is called amusia - music just doesn't make much sense to them. For example, they are often unable to recognize the melodies to famous songs. They may also not be able to tell if a musical note is out of tune, or play an instrument.\n\nOthers suffer from general anhedonia: That is, they have difficulty experiencing pleasure at all. This is particularly common among those who struggle with sadness or have certain brain diseases, like Alzheimer's.\n\nBut is there a separate musical anhedonia? The study suggests there may be.\n\nNone of those studied showed signs of general anhedonia. They reported no differences in their levels of pleasure when it came to things other than music. And all could easily tell if musical passages were happy, sad, scary or peaceful.\n\nWe tend to believe that everyone likes some kind of music. The study suggests that might not be true. It seems some people just don't get that much pleasure out of music.\n\n## Hard Time Picking Music\n\nIn the study, 13 pieces were used. These were selected after asking 200 people to list their favorite pieces of music. The set list was heavy on well-known classical pieces. Among these were \"Spring,\" from Vivaldi's \"Four Seasons,\" and the Puccini aria \"Nessun Dorma.\"\n\n\"Most of them are very well known classical pieces,\" Marco said. \"The list was not as original as we expected. We expected more pop music.\"\n\nAlso making the list was the musical theme to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, \"Barcelona.\"\n\nSubjects were also asked to bring in several songs of their own choice, Marco said. Those who particularly loved music brought in a very varied mix. This ranged from Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and Genesis to Beirut and Rihanna. Artists with more than one song included Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucia and Beethoven.\n\n\"I would say it was less typical,\" Marco said of the mix of tracks the music-lovers brought in.\n\nThose who felt less when listening to music had a hard time picking tracks to bring in. \"They were really having trouble,\" Marco said. \"Some of them asked family and friends to give them music.\"\n\nAmong the tracks they selected were pieces by Beethoven and the themes to \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"Superman.\" They also chose songs by the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.'"

            "text": "\tTaylor Swift has been all over the news. She released a new album, called \"1989,\" and soon after, she took her music off Spotify, the world's biggest streaming music service.\n\nOver the summer, Swift wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal, a financial newspaper. The 24-year-old songwriter used the newspaper to share her hopeful view of the music business. \"The music industry is not dying ... it's just coming alive,\" she wrote.\n\nSome thought it was easy for her to say. The week her album was released, Swift sold almost 1.3 million copies. She sold almost as many albums as every other artist put together the week before.\n\nSwift's upbeat attitude might come from her own lucky position. She works hard at selling her music by talking with her fans on social media like Twitter.\n\n## iTunes Versus Spotify\n\nIn the article she wrote for the newspaper, Swift had important points to make about the business of music. \"Music should not be free,\" she wrote.\n\nOn iTunes, Swift can make 70 cents for every dollar a fan spends buying her music. But on Spotify, she would make less than a penny for each song her fans listened to.\n\nMany in the music business see streaming as the only hope. Before the Internet, people would buy records, tapes or CDs to listen to music. When people started owning computers, there were ways of downloading music for free. It was illegal, but people still stole music from their favorite bands and singers.\n\nNow, some people think streaming services like Spotify or YouTube could earn back some of that money. Because it is cheap, people will pay for the service. It will not pay the musician as much, but they will still see some money.\n\nStill, a growing number of big artists have taken down some or all of their music from the service such as artists like Beyonce and the Beatles.\n\n## \"Getting A Fair Cut\"\n\nPatrick Carney, a drummer for the rock band the Black Keys, argued against the service. \"My whole thing about music is: If somebody's making money, then the artist should be getting a fair cut of it,\" he told one newspaper.\n\nIn her article over the summer, Swift wrote: \"Music is art, art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for.\"\n\nHer idea is noble. It would be easier to live by if the Internet had never happened. Still, if the Internet had never happened, Swift wouldn't have 46 million followers.\n\nMany agree with Swift. They believe that if musicians can afford to not use streaming services like Spotify, they should not give their art away.\n\nSmaller bands still have a problem. If an unknown band is trying to become famous, they have to be heard by people. These bands need to get their music out any way they can. Some bands make money by giving concerts or letting their songs be used in TV and video games. However, they still need to give fans a chance to hear their music first.\n\n## Bands And Fans\n\nFans have a problem with streaming, too. Music companies own the music fans listen to. Rather than letting fans own their collection, the music business is moving toward a model like Netflix. Fans can listen to any song, whenever and wherever. However, the fan must pay every time. Sometimes they pay Spotify. Other times, they must listen to an advertisement.\n\nHaving so many choices also makes it hard for fans to bond with a favorite artist. It is one reason why live concerts have become so important. Bands can make money from fans paying to see them perform. Concerts also give fans a chance to really connect with the artists they love.\n\nSwift is an expert at connecting with her fans. Even pulling her music off Spotify has helped her. Her fans must prove how much they love her by buying her album.'"

            "text": "\tSTOCKHOLM - Canadian short story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.\n\nMunro writes stories about the everyday lives of men and women in rural Canada and how they sometimes suddenly change. Her writing has been praised as elegant and exact. She is the first Canadian writer to receive the award since 1976.\n\nMunro captured a wide range of lives and personalities without passing judgment on her characters. Her work consists almost entirely of short stories. Most Nobel winners write novels or books. \"Lives of Girls and Women\" is her only novel. Even that is often described as a collection of linked stories.\n\n\"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,\" the 82-year-old told The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\n## Beloved And Admired\n\nMunro told Canadian broadcaster CBC she was \"surprised and delighted\" at the news. She heard she won in a predawn phone call from her daughter.\n\n\"It just seems impossible. It seems so splendid a thing to happen that I can't describe it. It's more than I can say,\" Munro said.\n\nMunro is beloved by other famous writers, from Lorrie Moore and George Saunders to Margaret Atwood and Jonathan Franzen. She is equally admired by critics. She won a National Book Critics Circle prize for \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage.\" She also won the Governor General's prize, Canada's highest literary honor, three times.\n\nAtwood - a fellow Canadian who some thought might win the Nobel - tweeted, \"Hooray! Alice Munro wins 2013 Nobel Prize in literature.\"\n\nThe award is likely to top off Munro's career. She told Canada's National Post in June that she was \"probably not going to write anymore.\"\n\nNobel prize secretary Peter Englund said he had not managed to get hold of her but left a message on her answering machine. Munro has taken the short story and made it almost perfect, Englund said.\n\n## A Novel Of Linked Stories\n\nIn a 1994 interview, she said she made a mistake in trying to write \"Lives of Girls and Women\" as a regular book, or novel.\n\n\"It didn't feel right to me, and I thought I would have to abandon it,\" she said. \"I was very depressed. Then it came to me that what I had to do was pull it apart and put it in story form. Then I could handle it. That's when I learned I was never going to write a real novel because I could not think that way.\"\n\nMunro is the 13th female literature winner in the 112-year history of the Nobel Prizes.\n\nMunro grew up in Wingham, a traditional Canadian town west of Toronto. Her stories tend to revolve around her experience there and her life after the social revolution of the 1960s. It was a time when women stepped out of traditional roles and both sexes behaved more freely.\n\nShe was born Alice Anne Laidlaw. Her parents were a fox farmer and a teacher. She liked to read in a town that didn't. Munro concealed her ambition like it was forbidden.\n\nShe received a scholarship to study at the University of Western Ontario, majoring in journalism. Munro was still an undergraduate when she sold a story to CBC radio in Canada. She dropped out of college to marry a fellow student, James Munro. They had three children and she became a full-time housewife. By her early 30s, she had become depressed and said she could barely write a full sentence.\n\n## \"The Bear Came Over The Mountain\"\n\nHer good fortune was to open a bookstore with her husband, in 1963. Her storytelling talents resurfaced but her marriage collapsed. Her first collection, \"Dance of the Happy Shades,\" came out in 1968 and won the Governor's prize.\n\nShe later married Gerald Fremlin, a geographer.\n\nHer stories are usually set in Ontario, where she lives. Among her best known is \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain.\" The story is about a woman who begins losing her memory and agrees with her husband that she should be placed in a nursing home.\n\nSome have called her \"the greatest author in North America and, yes, I tend to agree with that,\" said Englund.\n\nThe 2013 Nobel announcements continue Friday with the Nobel Peace Prize, followed by the economics prize on Monday. The awards will be handed to the winners on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896. Each Nobel comes with a $1.2 million prize.'"

            "title": "Catching some rays, beaming them to town",
            "text": "\tSTAVANGER, Norway - The sun is finally shining on the small Norwegian town of Rjukan.\n\nThe town is tucked between steep mountains. It is normally covered in shadow for almost six months a year. Residents have to catch a cable car to the top of a nearby cliff to get a fix of sunshine in the middle of the day.\n\nThat changed a bit on Wednesday. Dim rays from the winter sun reached the town's market square for the first time. Three 183-square-foot mirrors placed on a mountain helped the town see the light.\n\nTV footage of the event showed the center of the crowded square light up. But it was just a bit. It was not like the town was hit by direct sunlight. Still, people who live there said they could notice the effect.\n\n## A Coming Out Party\n\nCheering families put on sunglasses as the sun crept from behind a cloud. Some reclined on sun loungers. They drank beverages and waved Norwegian flags. The sunlight hit the mirrors and reflected down onto the faces of delighted children below.\n\n\"Before when it was a fine day, you would see that the sky was blue and you knew that the sun was shining. But you couldn't quite see it. It was very frustrating,\" said Karin Roe. She works for the local tourist office. \"This feels warm. When there is no time to get to the top of the mountains on weekdays, it will be lovely to come out for an hour and feel this warmth on my face.\"\n\nThe town of Rjukan often is freezing throughout the winter. So is much of Scandinavia. But on Wednesday, it was 45 degrees Fahrenheit in the town.\n\nRjukan is not the first place with mirror-assisted sunshine. The Italian town of Viganella has a similar sun mirror. Its mirror is smaller, though.\n\nNorwegian businessman Sam Eyde came up with the plan to bring sunlight to Rjukan 100 years ago. Eyde built the town between the mountains. He needed it to have workers at a plant he located at the foot of a nearby waterfall. The plant generated power from the rushing water.\n\nEyde never saw his plan happen. But his plant and the town he founded still were well-known in Norway. They were the site of the country's most famous wartime adventure.\n\nThe Germans took over Norway during World War II. The factory was an important spot in Germany's search for the atomic bomb. Twelve Norwegians parachuted into the nearby tundra and survived freezing temperatures to sabotage the factory's \"heavy water\" plant with bombs. The mission inspired a 1965 Hollywood film, \"The Heroes of Telemark.\" It is also being turned into a 10-part TV series by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle.\n\n## Marking A Bright Chapter\n\nNow, the three mirrors that reflected the sun onto the town are operated from Germany. The mirrors captured the sunlight and sent it in an curve that lit up about one-third of the square below.\n\nA cloud weakened the sun's effect. But a band encouraged the cloud to move away with the song, \"Let The Sunshine In.\"\n\nJan-Anders Dam-Nielsen is director of the Norwegian Industrial Museum, located on the site of the famous factory. He said the solar experiment would mark another chapter in the history of Rjukan.\n\n\"Soon we will celebrate 70 years since the saboteurs struck the factory,\" he said. \"Then we will think about how we mark this. This is a really important day in the history of this town. And like the mirrors reflected the sun, we will reflect this in the museum.\"\n\nThe mirrors, or heliostats, cost about $850,000. They were helicoptered in and installed 1,500 feet above the town square. The computer-controlled mirrors are more commonly used to create solar power in the sunniest regions of the Middle East. Here, the solar energy the heliostats capture is used to power them as they follow the sun's brief dash across the Norwegian winter sky.\n\nThe century-old idea was revived in 2005 by artist Martin Andersen, a resident of the town who helped raise the money to pay for the mirrors. The lion's share has come from Norsk Hydro - the company founded by Sam Eyde.'"

            "text": "\tPEARL HARBOR, Hawaii - On Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor, an American military base in Hawaii. The attack killed around 2,400 people including sailors, Marines and soldiers.\n\nAbout 1,177 of the people killed were on a battleship called the USS Arizona. The ship was bombed and sunk during the attack. The attack caused the United States to fight in World War II, which was already going mostly in Europe.\n\nNow, four survivors who were on the USS Arizona have come together. Every year, on the day of the attack, they gather in Pearl Harbor. They come to mark the event, and to honor the many who died that day.\n\nToday, only nine survivors of the bombing of the Arizona are still alive. The four who came to Hawaii on Tuesday are now all in their 90s. Still, they promised that this year's reunion would not be their last.\n\n## Last Official Gathering\n\nThe four survivors gathered on Tuesday near the memorial that sits on top of the sunken Arizona. The event was the last official gathering of the USS Arizona Reunion Association. However, the men said they still plan to get together, even if they can't come to Hawaii.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to be our last. ... We've still got time to go,\" said survivor Louis Conter, who is 93. \"We'll be back out here no matter whether the rest of the crowd can make it or not.\"\n\nDonald Stratton, who is 92 years old, is another of the four survivors who came to Hawaii on Tuesday. He was in the front part of the ship when the Arizona was hit.\n\nDuring the bombing, Stratton was working with a group of men, most of whom were killed. The men were gathered around a gun-director machine. Their job was to figure out the best firing angles for the ship's huge guns. Stratton and the others had sprung into action once it became clear Pearl Harbor was under attack.\n\nStratton survived the bombing, but he was badly hurt. More than half his body was burned. He was hospitalized for over a year, then released from the Navy. A year later, he rejoined the Navy.\n\n## \"Just A Few Of Us\"\n\n\"The good Lord saved just a few of us,\" Stratton said.\n\nDuring a private event Sunday, the four men will toast their shipmates. They will share a bottle of wine given to them by President Gerald Ford in 1975. Their glasses will be copies of ones used onboard the Arizona at the time.\n\nThe men arrived at the Pearl Harbor visitor center on Tuesday. They were met with military salutes, music from the Navy's Pacific Fleet Band and photo-taking tourists. The four discussed their memories of the attack.\n\n\"I learned something about faith,\" said John Anderson, who is 97. He remembers that he had just gone to church and was heading to breakfast when someone said he saw the planes coming. He became teary-eyed as he talked about his twin brother dying in the attack.\n\n\"It's always like yesterday when we're out here,\" Conter said.\n\n## Their Shipmates Below\n\nOn Tuesday, the survivors also watched a live video. It showed divers swimming underwater alongside the Arizona's main body, or hull. The bodies of more than 900 men who died in 1941 are still there.\n\nThe ashes of 38 survivors who died years later are buried down in the hull as well. The men wanted to be buried next to their fellow sailors who were killed.\n\nSurvivor Lauren Bruner, 94, plans to have his ashes placed down in the hull. Conter does too.\n\nBruner spoke of his decision not to be buried in an ordinary military graveyard. The dead in such places are often quickly forgotten, he said.\n\n\"It seems like after a while nobody pays attention to them anymore, after about five years,\" he said. \"I hope a lot of people will still be ... coming over to the Arizona and we'll be glad to see them.\"'"

            "title": "Mammoth \"Mural\" masterpiece's myth gets busted",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Myths die hard. Especially when they're about a painting that helped give birth to a respected movement in American art. The painting in question is Jackson Pollock's mammoth 1943 \"Mural.\"\n\n\"Mural\" was something entirely new for American art. Nearly 8 feet high and 20 feet wide, it was covered edge-to-edge with rhythmic lines and bold shapes. These lines and shapes didn't represent anything in particular: That is, they were abstract. They were more about feelings and ideas than physical things. Still, the artist compared them to a stampede of mustang horses. The great painting did much to kick off the art movement called Abstract Expressionism, which emerged in New York following World War II.\n\nAbstract Expressionism was the first American art style to have a major international influence. For a time, it put New York at the center of the art world. Primarily a painting style, it avoided representing people, landscapes or objects. Instead, it aimed to express feeling and energy. It also emphasized spontaneous creation - creating in the moment, without planning - and the act of painting itself.\n\nPollock's painting went on public view at the J. Paul Getty Museum on Tuesday. But now, part of the myth of how he created the painting has been proven false by science.\n\n## Took Days, Not One Night\n\nFor years it was believed that Pollock painted \"Mural\" in one glorious burst. The usual story is that Pollock worried about the huge blank canvas for months. He was unsure of what to do with it. Its blankness almost seemed to mock him. Then came a sudden burst of brilliant, all-night action: By morning, the masterpiece had been created.\n\nExcept, that's not what really happened. We now know that he painted over many days and perhaps even several weeks.\n\nCollector and art dealer Peggy Guggenheim commissioned the work in the summer of 1943. She was planning a November Pollock show for her art gallery. The huge painting would serve as a statement of her faith in Pollock. He was not well-known at the time.\n\nThe canvas is four times bigger than any Pollock had previously attempted. He probably struggled with the immensity of the task.\n\nJust after nightfall on the day before the work was due, Lee Krasner, Pollock's girlfriend, said he began to paint. Fifteen intense hours later, Krasner said \"Mural\" was done.\n\n\"I had a vision,\" Pollock later explained.\n\n## Painting's Layers Looked At\n\nBut now we know for certain that story isn't quite right. This is thanks to the Getty Museum's careful study of the work's layers of paint.\n\nTheir examination shows that Pollock laid out a rough first version of the painting. For this stage, he placed wet paint on top of wet paint. He worked with teal, lemon yellow, red and brown oil paints. Perhaps this stage was indeed done in a single lengthy session.\n\nHowever, much of the paint was applied later. And the separate layers each required drying time, some for many days.\n\nMore than 25 paints have been identified. That includes white patches of ordinary house paint - a surprise discovery.\n\nNow that the myth of the one-shot painting binge has been undone, it's worth asking: What purpose did that unlikely story serve in the first place?\n\nSurely one reason was to make Pollock seem like a bold man of action. Consider who the tale's main source was: Krasner, Pollock's girlfriend.\n\n## A Hard-Working Artist\n\nIn 1943 Pollock was 31 years old. He was an artist living in Greenwich Village in the midst of World War II. At the time, most young American men were off fighting or at least wearing a uniform. That made him seem cowardly to some.\n\nWhat's more, Krasner had heard rumors that Pollock was secretly gay. Being gay was something not accepted at that time. The story of one brilliant, all-night explosion of painting helped make Pollock sound  and manly. That, in turn, helped fight off the doubts and rumors.\n\nWhich raises a question: Does the disproved theory about how Pollock created \"Mural\" decrease its artistic importance - or Pollock's?\n\nThe answer is that it shouldn't. In fact, it should make us appreciate Pollock all the more.\n\nThe carefully made painting shows us something important. Pollock was an artist who knew exactly what he was aiming for - and who worked hard to get there. He slowly built up his vision bit by bit over days (or weeks).\n\nThat may not match today's popular idea of the artist as a mysterious genius whose ideas come fully formed. But the popular image doesn't fit how artists actually work. Pollock was a real-life artist. He thought a lot about \"Mural,\" and he worked very hard to create it.'"

            "text": "\tBERKELEY, Calif. - Protesters around the country are raising their voices. They are chanting sayings like \"Hands Up! Don't Shoot!\" And for the first time in years, they are also singing to express their anger and pain.\n\nIn the last few weeks, grand juries in New York and Missouri decided not to indict, or charge, police officers in the deaths of two black men. A grand jury is made up of a group of citizens. They decide if a person should be formerly accused of a crime. The men, Eric Garner and Michael Brown, were killed over the summer by white police officers trying to arrest them. Protests over their deaths have broken out in cities across the country.\n\nProtest songs have not been heard in the United States since the 1960s. Then, singer and protester Pete Seeger helped make \"We Shall Overcome\" an important song of the 1960s civil rights movement. The civil rights movement fought for equal treatment of black people in the U.S.\n\n## Singing Old Songs, And New\n\nNow, old songs are being sung by a new generation of protesters. New songs are being written and shared. Some of the songs are by major artists.\n\n\"Facts aren't fueling this fire. Feeling is what is fueling this fire,\" said Daniels Watts.  He is a Broadway performer who starred in a protest flash mob in New York City's Times Square. \"Until we express those feelings and those feelings are understood, we aren't going to get too far.\"\n\nOne of the new protest songs was written six weeks ago by Luke Nephew. He is a 32-year-old New York poet. His song starts, \"I still hear my brother crying, 'I can't breathe.' Now I'm in the struggle singing. I can't leave.\"\n\nHundreds of people sang those words last week as they blocked bridges and got arrested in New York. They were protesting the grand jury's decision in the Gardner case.\n\n## A Song For A Protest\n\nNephew first introduced the song at a meeting of protesters way before the grand jury decision. The protesters taught it to people in their groups. They wanted as many people as possible to sing along during protests. A recording was posted on YouTube. There were links to it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOne of the activists, Jose Lopez, said they told people, \"Make sure you are taking this back to your organizations. Make sure you are learning this.\"\n\nSinger and radio host Darlene McCoy started a protest group called Mothers of Black Sons. She was at home watching television when she heard the protesters in New York singing as police were arresting them. McCoy wrote down the song's words and immediately recorded herself singing it. She posted it on Instagram and challenged other singers to do the same. At least one version has been viewed nearly 750,000 times.\n\nSome protesters are finding new meaning in the words of old popular music. They are singing \"A Change is Gonna Come\" by Sam Cooke and Michael Jackson's \"They Don't Really Care About Us.\"\n\nNephew wonders why music has not been a part of American protests since the 1960s. He thinks people are no longer used to singing together. Also, younger Americans are turned off by older songs about things that happened in the past.\n\n## \"Requiem For Mike Brown\"\n\nQuestlove is the drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots. Through Instagram and Twitter, he urged fellow musicians last week \"to be a voice of the times that we live in.\" He noted that \"protest songs don't have to be boring or non-danceable.\"\n\nSeveral musicians have already released songs in memory of Brown and Garner. They include Alicia Keys and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morelo.\n\nAmateurs have gotten into the act too. In St. Louis, a group interrupted a classical music performance of Brahms' \"Requiem,\" the Catholic religious service for the dead. The protesters sang a song they called \"Requiem for Mike Brown.\" They also scattered little paper hearts from the balcony.\n\nProtest songs were an important symbol of the 1960s. It is not clear whether any of the new protest songs will come to have the same meaning.\n\nThis may not happen immediately, said Ian Peddie, an English professor at Georgia Gwinnett College in Georgia. Peddie studies popular music and human rights.\n\nIt takes time for ideas to spread and for people to write good songs.'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE, Wash. - There was a loud, hot burst of steam. Then the great Seattle Gum Wall began melting away.\n\nThe Gum Wall was made of a million pieces of chewed gum. It had been Seattle's weirdest tourist attraction. It served as a colorful backdrop for many selfies, wedding shots and even baby announcements. \n\nThe great Seattle Gum Wall began melting away in early November. \n\nTwo workers in protective gear did the dirty job. The first sprayed hot steam onto the old brick. The second scraped off the softened gum with a rake. Steam hissed. Clumps of gum fell like the soft patter of rain.\n\n## In Other Cities, They Just Stick It Under The Chair\n\nA blast of old mint mixed with a fruity smell filled the dark little alley in Seattle's famous Pike Place fish market. \n\n\"Awww,\" said one passer-by. \"Goodbye!\"\n\nNostalgic fans began journeying to the Gum Wall more than a week before it came down. Kymberly Dempsey lives nearby in Snohomish, Washington. She took her four children out of school so they wouldn't miss this important moment.\n\nDempsey's great-grandmother owned a Swedish bakery in Pike Place Market before the Gum Wall came about. Back then chewing gum makers still used chicle, or natural tree sap. Today's gum is made from artificial rubber.\n\nDempsey only takes her children out of school for important events like the Seahawks Super Bowl championship parade and the Gum Wall. \"If you miss it, you'll never get to see it again,\" said Dempsey. \"It's gross, but it's also so colorful that it's kind of beautiful.\"\n\n## Public Art -- And It Smells Like Hubba Bubba\n\nThe Gum Wall is fairly new to Seattle. It's younger than the Space Needle, but older than the Great Wheel, the Ferris wheel that take riders high over Puget Sound. \n\nSome people say the wall grew out of boredom.\n\nAround 20 years ago, long lines for comedy shows at the Market Theater stretched down Post Alley. Theatergoers would stick their chewed-up gum to the brick wall outside the theater.\n\nMercedes Carrabba owns a small coffee shop overlooking the wall. For years, the wads clung to just a few square feet of the alley's east wall, she said. Then, social media like Facebook spread, and so did the gum. By the end, around 1,000 square feet of hardened gum clung to both walls of Post Alley. People posted pictures of themselves in front of the wall on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIt's not just taking a photo, she added. It's also a way for people to share pictures and interact.\n\n## A Bridal Portrait Backdrop\n\nAllison Hazen and Philip Prahst swooped into Gum Alley on an August day in 2012, a time of year when gum is at its goopiest. It was their wedding day. She wore a long white gown. They wanted to celebrate the moment with a backdrop of Hubba Bubba and Trident.\n\nIt was a perfect moment. They forgot just one thing. The gum.\n\n\"We were walking down the ramp, and people started noticing us,\" Hazen recounted. \"They made us feel like royalty.\" The crowd clapped and cheered. One woman even filled up Hazen's hands with white gum.\n\nThe crowds had all but disappeared as the cleaning crew set up recently. Two women from Korea were the only ones snapping pictures with their cellphones in the early-morning darkness.\n\nThey came to see the Gum Wall for the first time right before it was removed.\n\n## The Gum Wall Rises Again\n\nNo one knew how long the newly cleaned brick of Post Alley would remain gum-free.\n\nLeonard Garfield is in charge of Seattle's Museum of History & Industry. He said he would be surprised if Seattle was ready to leave this important piece of history behind. \"It went up. It's coming down. It will go up again.\"\n\nGarfield was right. No sooner had the wall been scrubbed clean for the first time in 20 years than gum began to be added again.'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING, China - A 59-year-old woman in China got a big surprise when she visited the new local cemetery. She said her name was written in gold letters on one of the tombstones.\n\nHundreds of other people had the same thing happen to them. These people were all very much alive but had tombstones at the cemetery. One tombstone had the name Yao Ming. He is China's most famous basketball player and a former star in the National Basketball Association in America.\n\nThe woman complained to the cemetery staff but did not get any real answers, according to a report in Beijing's Jinghua Times.\n\nWang recently went to court, saying that people who built the cemetery had hurt her name and her family's reputation. Three relatives also had fake graves, she said. She wants the people who run the cemetery to say they are sorry. She also asked for $16,000 for her emotional pain.\n\n## Death Is A Doorway To Profit In China\n\nCemeteries are a big business in China, a country that is running out of room to bury people. Gravesites can sell for $5,000 to $8,500 each. Cemeteries can make a lot of money, but the burial business also has some problems.\n\nAbout 10 million people die in China each year. Space for graves in the country of 1.3 billion is limited by rising land prices and an aging population. This has caused costs for a burial plot, or place to bury somebody, to soar. Many Chinese complain that it is too expensive to die. They are only sort of joking.\n\nThe problem has gotten so bad in Beijing that the city government started encouraging families to be buried at sea. Families who bury people in the ocean can receive about $640. The sea burials help save space on land.\n\nDemand for cemetery pace has stayed about the same, but prices keep going up, said Guo Yu. She is a 25-year-old sales representative at Wanfo Huaqiao cemetery near Beijing. The cemetery is one of the city's most respected. Guo said while the government restricts grave plots to 32 square feet, the cemetery has boosted the money it makes by building graves with thicker, higher-quality stones. \"They look grander that way,\" she said.\n\n## Most Cemeteries Under Government Control\n\nLocal governments control most graveyards in China. The governments earn a lot of money selling plots or giving land to cemetery builders. The money involved makes the business a good place for cheating.\n\nChina is quickly running out of space for graves. In 2013, the government said the country would be out of burial spaces by 2019.\n\nThe Changping local government has been investigating the China Dragon court case. It has also put up a sign in front of the graveyard. The sign calls it an \"illegal cemetery,\" according to local media reports.\n\nPeople told judges in court that the operators of the cemetery were eager to attract customers. The operators began selling the graveyard even before they had permission from the government, the judges were told.\n\nThis is common for Chinese businesses, said Qi Lianfeng. He is a Beijing lawyer.\n\n## Money-Hungry Operators Ignoring Rules\n\nThe government is not strict about enforcing the rules, he said. A lot of businesses trying to make money will open before they have all the government papers they need, he said.\n\nQi said he had never heard of such a fake-grave case before. \"It just goes to show, the grave business is doing well,\" he said.\n\nThe graveyard was advertised as a beautiful location. The ad even noted that a brother of a Chinese emperor was buried nearby.\n\nAuthorities said about half of the 600 tombs at that cemetery were fakes.\n\nAmong people in the countryside, writing the name of a living person on a gravestone is considered \"very bad luck,\" Wang told the newspaper. \"They said I was dead so they could earn money; I think this is a violation of my rights.\"'"

            "text": "\tINDIAN LAND, S.C. - North and South Carolina used to be places where a lot of fabric for clothing was made. Textile factories there produced cloth and other fabrics for things like bedding.\n\nThen in the late 1990s, factories started closing. Thousands of jobs were lost to cheaper materials and cheaper workers in other countries. American textile factory jobs went to places like China, Brazil and Vietnam.\n\nNow, some jobs are coming back. Keer is a Chinese textile company. It is building factories to make yarn in Lancaster County, South Carolina. More than 500 jobs will be created.\n\nChinese companies are looking to make fabric in the United States. They are attracted by lower costs for energy, cotton and land. The companies are also worried about the rising cost of workers in China.\n\nWally Wang is deputy general manager at Keer America. He believes more Chinese textile companies and other manufacturers will follow Keer to the United States.\n\nThat would be welcomed in Lancaster County.\n\n## The Closings Were Shocking\n\nCarolyn Summers worked for Springs Industries in Lancaster for 42 years. She was laid off in 2005. Her daughter lost her job two years later. Summers remembers leaving the factory \"in total shock\" the day she heard the news.\n\nSprings Mills in Lancaster once employed close to 20,000 people. In 2007, the last South Carolina textile factory closed.\n\nLancaster County lost 11,000 textile jobs from 1995 to 2007. Summers said people did not think textile jobs would ever come back.\n\nAt least 140 employees will begin working at Keer's new site starting in spring. Most will make yarn on 32 production lines.\n\nKeer will spend $218 million to move part of its yarn production to Lancaster.\n\nWhile the first plant operates, construction workers will lay the foundation for a second factory to the south of it. The construction will take less than 18 months. After that, Keer plans to build two more factories.\n\n## Cotton Lures Companies Back\n\nA South Carolina workforce training program is helping Keer find and train local works. These include electricians, technicians and people to sell fabric. One-third of the people applying are former textile workers.\n\nTextile mills came to the Carolinas because of cotton 200 years ago. And cotton is bringing them back again.\n\nThe cost to manufacture in China has risen in the past few years. Keer came to the Carolinas after ruling out Vietnam, India and Pakistan as possible destinations.\n\nKeer had been using American cotton for years. Now it simply moved closer to be able to use more.\n\nWang listed the benefits Keer can enjoy in South Carolina. \"It is a state built on manufacturing,\" he said. Workers are also used to working at all hours. Electricity is inexpensive and it works all the time. Sometimes electricity in China is unreliable.\n\nEverything is cheaper except the workers, Wang said.\n\nIt is still cheaper to make clothes in China, said professor Yingjiao Xu of N.C. State University. Putting together clothing requires a lot of labor, she said. Labor costs less in China. Manufacturing yarn and fabrics, however, is done by machines. U.S. sites are cheaper for that because energy costs less.\n\n## Changes Started To Happen\n\nKeer took the lead in approaching the state of South Carolina. John Ling, a China native who has worked for South Carolina, was surprised. At first, he doubted a Chinese textile company would even think about coming to the United States.\n\nA change came in 2010 when the Chinese government started loaning companies money to spend outside of China.\n\nNow, there are 20 to 25 Chinese companies visiting South Carolina each year, Ling said. They are looking to spend money here.\n\nDoug Woodward, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina, described the incoming Chinese companies' spending as \"small tiptoes into the U.S. for these big companies.\"\n\n\"It's just the beginning,\" he believes.\n\nWang is making sure things work between China and the United States. He said Chinese business spending in the United States \"was like water drops, but now there's a little stream flowing.\"'"

She has to be able to explain the differences between Irvine and Tustin to people who have never been to the United States.\n\nChen also has to be able to explain how home-buying works in this country. Many of Chen's customers own businesses and are successful in their native land. However, that does not mean they understand how home sales work in the United States.\n\n\"In Taiwan you can still buy property on a napkin. Here it's a book full of paperwork and timelines,\" she said. \"There's a lot of education I have to do.\"\n\n## Wake-Up Calls\n\nFor Chen, it leads to a lot of Skype calls in the middle of the night. It also means a lot of missed sleep, because of the time difference between China and the United States.\n\n\"Eleven p.m. to 2 a.m. - that's the best time to talk,\" she said.\n\nChen now lives in Irvine, but was born in Taiwan. About five years ago, she saw a business opportunity. Homes were not selling easily in Southern California at the time. However, rich overseas Chinese were looking to buy.\n\nMany of Chen's customers were Chinese-American. She began asking them if they knew anyone back in China who might be interested in buying a house here. She told them that good money could be made. Buyers could rent homes out or sell them for more money later on.\n\nAt first, overseas Chinese buyers were a little cautious, she recalled. \"They'd say, 'OK, I'll buy one property.' Six months later they were amazed at how much they were getting back. They'd call and say, 'I want to buy more.'\"\n\n## Get It While It's Hot\n\nToday, Chinese citizens are snatching up Southern California real estate. During the 12 months that ended in March, they bought $22 billion worth of homes in the United States. The Greater Los Angeles area is their favorite place to buy.\n\nSome buyers are planning to move here and are getting homes for themselves. Others are buying homes for their children to live in while they attend college. Others buy homes to make money.\n\nSelling homes to overseas buyers can be complicated.\n\nU.S. home buyers are usually familiar with an area's neighborhoods. They can explore the streets around a property to get a feel for a place. A buyer from China is much more limited. They are forced to rely on Internet searches and maybe a quick shopping trip. Many of Chen's overseas customers buy U.S. homes without ever seeing them.\n\nChen has to spend a lot of time describing different neighborhoods.\n\n\"They know Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Irvine,\" she said. \"They say, 'Where's Tustin? Where's Lake Forest?' I tell them they're right next to Irvine.\"\n\n## Business Is Good, For Now\n\nChen now has offices in Irvine, Chino and Taiwan. Business has been good, but she wonders how much longer that will last.\n\nThe Chinese government and the U.S. government may soon make it harder for overseas Chinese to buy and make money from U.S. homes. Overseas buyers may not be be willing to pay as much as they have been. If that happens, home prices will probably drop. Chen would then start to make less money. Her earnings are based on the prices of homes she sells.\n\nOf course, there could be an upside. People in the United States who are not rich might have an easier time buying homes.\n\n\"I think the next few years are going to be a good time for first-time buyers,\" Chen said.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Edward Marks has dreamed up some of the most exciting amusement park attractions in the United States. His team has invented high-tech rides and glow-in-the-dark parades. They've even made 3-D simulators full of mummies, aliens and crazy clowns.\n\nBut to make money from China's theme park boom, Marks needs more than creativity. He must become an expert on Chinese folk stories and superstitions. He also needs a lot of patience.\n\n## Fun With Feng Shui\n\nA building with four roof tops? Don't even think about building one in China. The number 4 sounds like the word for \"death\" in Chinese. It is considered bad luck, said Marks. He is the head of the Producers Group, a theme park design and construction company.\n\n\"We've had to flip entire buildings, move attractions and change elements because of feng shui reasons,\" Marks said. In Chinese, feng shui means wind-water. Feng Shui is a Chinese belief that buildings must face in certain directions for good luck.\n\nThese are welcome challenges for Marks and others in California's theme park business. China is building so many theme parks that their business is booming.\n\n## Jobs For Artists, Designers\n\nThe popularity of theme parks overseas is also leading to more jobs here. Many firms cannot even start working on new jobs for six to 12 months. Because of the demand, design firms do not have enough artists, designers and technicians. Marks thinks his 45-person team could grow to 70 by year's end.\n\nAmerican companies earn $500,000 to $7 million to design a theme park in China. More detailed construction plans cost up to $15 million.\n\nIn 2013 alone, Chinese developers spent nearly $24 billion on theme park construction, according to AECOM, an engineering company in California. In 2011, Chinese developers spent just $9 billion.\n\nGary Goddard is the founder of Gary Goddard Entertainment. His company designs theme parks and resorts. He estimated that about half his work recently has been in Asia and the Middle East.\n\n## Looks Like 8? That's Great!\n\nGoddard said his designers are careful to respect the local culture.\n\nA resort in Macau features a double Ferris wheel. It looks like the number 8.\n\n\"That was a very deliberate move to make the number 8, \" he said. \"That is considered a lucky number over there.\"\n\nChina's demand for theme parks has several reasons. China's growing middle class is one of them. They have money to spend, but there are not many places to have fun.\n\nBy 2020, AECOM predicts there will be more people going to Chinese amusement parks than American ones. Parks operated by a Chinese company already attract more than 26 million visitors a year.\n\nUnited States theme park companies are spending a lot of money in Asia.\n\nThe $4 billion Shanghai Disney resort is expected to open late this year. The $1.8 billion Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005. Universal Studios and Six Flags will have their own parks.\n\n## It's Harder Than It Looks\n\nIn China, the parks draw on stories from Chinese history or fairy tales. Parks in the United States and Europe get their themes from movies and books.\n\nMany projects, though, will never be built. Some Chinese developers do not understand how expensive it is to build a theme park, American designers say.\n\n\"Until you know how the sausage is made, you don't know how expensive it is to make that sausage,\" said Josh Updike. He is the creative director of Rethink Leisure &amp; Entertainment. The company is working on several projects in China and other countries in Asia.\n\nRegardless, the Californian theme park industry is growing rich.\n\n\"Everyone I know in town is busy,\" Updike said.\n\nThe extra work means designers spend a lot of time flying back and forth to Asia. Goddard has flown 3 million miles. Updike has logged more than 200,000 miles in the air last year alone.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Environmentalists are worried about the monarch butterfly. The colorful, graceful insect is disappearing fast.\n\nThe number of monarch butterflies in the United States has fallen drastically. In 2013, groups say the number of butterflies was down to almost one-tenth of its usual average.\n\nIn other words, if over the last 20 years the monarch population was around 100 butterflies, last year there were 10.\n\nA group of people want to stop this rapid decline. They asked the government to call the monarch butterfly an endangered species. They would be protected by the Fish and Wildlife Service if they were called endangered. There are laws put in place to protect them.\n\n## Helping Crops Is Hurting Monarchs\n\nThese environmentalists wrote a report, called a petition. They asked Fish and Wildlife to protect the disappearing insect.\n\nThey believe that a company named Monsanto is to blame for the rapid loss of monarchs. Monsanto produces chemicals that help certain plants grow stronger and faster. One of their products is called Roundup. It is a spray that farmers use on crops. Roundup helps kill weeds.\n\nBut Roundup also kills milkweed. Milkweed is the monarch caterpillar's only source of food. Farmers are destroying the monarch's food source by using Roundup. When a caterpillar starves, it cannot turn into a butterfly.\n\nThe environmentalists said that the use of Roundup and other crops has \"wiped out milkweed plants.\"\n\n## Monarchs Are Sensitive\n\nHowever, Monsanto Company disagrees.\n\nCharla Lord is a spokeswoman for Monsanto. She said there are many reasons the monarchs might be dying. She believes that \"weather events\" and \"logging in Mexico\" kill milkweed. She said that Monsanto would help restore the habitats.\n\nIn addition to chemicals like Roundup, other factors indeed threaten butterflies. The climate can affect butterflies. When there is a heat wave or a drought, butterflies may die because they cannot find water. Also, humans can damage butterfly habitats by building homes and cutting down trees and plants.\n\nScientists know that there is not much time. In the mid-1990s, there were about 1 billion butterflies in North America. In 2013, there were only 35 million.\n\n## Butterflies Need Attention, Too\n\nTierra Curry, who works at the Center for Biological Diversity, hopes that good weather this year will help increase the population.\n\n\"We're at risk of losing a symbolic backyard beauty that has been part of the childhood of every generation,\" she said.\n\nThe environmentalists think the endangered species label will help draw attention to the butterflies and help protection them.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service is required to respond to the petition within 90 days, although they may not issue a decision for up to nine months. The monarch butterfly is not yet specially protected.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Last week, officials of the small town of Willits, Calif., looked at their two local reservoirs. After a bit of calculating, they realized they only had enough water to last 100 days. It was time to adopt the toughest water use rules they could.\n\nThe 5,000 inhabitants of this former lumber town in Mendocino County are now on a water diet. A family of four gets a ration of no more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent.\n\n\"The more we looked at the data, the more we realized the situation is bleak,\" Willits City Manager Adrienne Moore said.\n\nCalifornia was already parched from last year's dry weather. Now as the winter progresses, concern is growing. It appears California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s. Or, even worse, the drought of 1977.\n\n## Too Much Sun\n\nThe snow and rain could still come. Only about half of the rainy season is over. But if nonstop sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread.\n\n\"A lot of the smaller systems are going to be really hurting,\" said Maury Roos, the state's chief water supply expert. \"They really don't have a lot of carry-over\" of supplies from one year to the next.\n\nWater managers in Southern California, on the other hand, are doing all right. They say they have enough reserves to get the state's most heavily populated region through the year without enforcing rations.\n\nThe huge Imperial Irrigation District is also in good shape. It is one of the country's major sources of winter lettuce and vegetables. The district will get its regular Colorado River irrigation deliveries this year. And many growers on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers will also do relatively well: They won't suffer more than a 25 percent cut.\n\nThe story will be different for many San Joaquin Valley growers, particularly on the valley's south and west sides. And also for ranchers and communities that depend on local surface supplies.\n\n\"I shudder to think if rain doesn't come,\" said Carre Brown, a supervisor in Mendocino County. \"All our reservoirs are very, very low.\"\n\n## Storage Dropping In Reservoirs\n\nLast year was California's driest year in 119 years of records. But from the point of view of water supply, the state is just now tipping into drought.\n\nOn Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown officially declared that California is in a drought emergency. He called it an \"unprecedented,\" or never-before-seen, situation.\n\nStorage in most major reservoirs is well below average for the time of year. And it's dropping when it should be rising.\n\nThere's always a chance the weather could change, of course.\n\nIn early 2009, the state warned of dire drought. Then a series of February storms arrived. And back in 1991 a \"Miracle March\" brought three times the month's normal rainfall.\n\nSome of the grimmest measurements this year are from Folsom Lake on the American River northeast of Sacramento. The reservoir is only 18 percent full, a near record low. This has gotten the attention of places not known for their thrifty water ways.\n\n## \"Less Water To Rely On\"\n\n\"Folsom Lake - it's pretty obvious there's a problem,\" said water manager Shauna Lorance. Her system delivers Folsom water to the suburbs ringing Sacramento. The big landscaped lots and irrigated horse pastures in those areas drive the district's per-person water use to about 369 gallons a day. That is three times the rate in Los Angeles.\n\nThe district has asked customers to stop all outdoor watering. If it remains dry, Lorance said, that request probably would turn into an order.\n\nSacramento itself draws some supplies from the American River. On Tuesday, the City Council approved making people stick to a ration.\n\n\"We're asking all water users to reduce their usage by 20 percent,\" City Manager John Shirey said. \"We think that's entirely attainable.\"\n\nCalifornia's capital city has traditionally been something of a water hog. It is situated on two rivers and has scorching summers.\n\nStill, water use has dropped in recent years. And, Shirey said, rainless seasons like this will further drive home the need to conserve - all the time.\n\n\"With [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) occurring we have to assume that we could see long-term shortages of water in California, \" he said. \"We just have to change, I think, the mindset here and everywhere - we're going to have less water to rely on.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - The bones of a previously unknown type of ancient leopard are shaking up old ideas. They suggest that big cats first arose in Asia, not Africa.\n\nPaleontologists, scientists who study ancient bones and other remains known as fossils, discovered the previously unknown species in Tibet in 2010. The newly found leopard is related to the modern snow leopard. The fossils from seven of the cats range in age from 4.1 million to 5.9 million years old. That makes these big cats as much as 2 million years older than any previously known ones.\n\nPanthera blytheae was slightly smaller than today's snow leopard. It probably roamed the Tibetan mountains for several million years. There it dined on antelope, pika and blue sheep, according to paleontologist Zhijie Jack Tseng.\n\nTseng was the leader of the new study of the fossils. He is currently working at New York's American Museum of Natural History.\n\n## Separate Branch Of Big Cats\n\nThe snow leopard and the newly found cat probably represent a separate branch of the cat family, said Tseng. This branch was adapted to life high in the Tibetan mountains.\n\nBig cats present serious problems for paleontologists. The cats have been around much longer than modern man has. But they didn't leave behind many fossils. The result is a poor record of the millions of years they've roamed the earth.\n\nScientists don't only study big cats by looking at their bones. They also look at their genes, or DNA. To do this, they look at the DNA of living species.\n\nWhat scientists have found suggests that big cats split off from other cats about 11 million years ago. They then evolved into various separate species. That change happened about 6 million years ago. The big cats became lions, tigers, jaguars and leopards.\n\n## Asia, Not Africa?\n\nBut there's a problem: What scientists find by looking at big cat genes doesn't agree with what the fossils tell them about where the cats came from.\n\n\"If you only looked at the fossil, it would suggest Africa,\"  Tseng said. \"If you only looked at DNA, it would suggest Asia.\" Scientists haven't been able to make the two kinds of evidence match up.\n\nScientists hope the fossils from Tibet will solve the problem. Tseng and the others used them to rework the so-called evolutionary tree for big cats. Evolutionary trees trace which species are descended from which, and where they split off. The researchers then matched the new evolutionary tree up with a timeline based on the DNA evidence.\n\nWhat they found supports the theory that the cats arose and flourished in Asia.\n\n\"We have the oldest but not the most primitive (species),\" Tseng said. This \"is interesting because it means that there are more primitive cats to be found in the fossil record.\" These \"would be older than the one we have now.\"\n\n## A Beloved Stuffed Snow Leopard\n\nPanthera blytheae was named in honor of Blythe Haaga. She is the daughter of Paul and Heather Haaga. Both parents are longtime supporters of the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nPaul is a former museum official. He already had the smallest known dinosaur species named for his family - Fruitadens haagarorum. His wife Heather suggested naming the ancient leopard species for their daughter, Blythe.\n\nAs a child, Blythe was fascinated with snow leopards. This fascination started after she was given a stuffed toy snow leopard. She now is a comedian and writer splitting her time between Chicago and Los Angeles. The family timed the honor for Blythe's 30th birthday.\n\nBlythe found out about her birthday honor as she flew home from Chicago on Monday. Just how important the fossils are was kept quiet until the new study was published. \"Now I'm super honored,\" she said when told of the study's findings. \"I was just honored before.\"\n\nThe snow leopard \"was the stuffed animal that I loved,\" Blythe said. \"Every book report was on snow leopards for a long time after that. It became my fascination for a while.\"'"

            "text": "\tTEL AVIV, Israel - If you thought recycling was modern habit - think again.\n\nOur prehistoric ancestors learned to recycle thousands of years ago. They recycled the objects they used in their daily lives. Researchers presented the evidence at a conference in Tel Aviv.\n\nIt's the first time researchers have shown how cavemen recycled, said Ran Barkai. He's an archeologist who helped organize the conference. Like other archeologists, Barkai studies the history of humankind through objects he finds in the ground.\n\nEarly humans collected broken tools made of flint and bone, Barkai said. They used them to make new things, he said. It's just like we recycle paper and plastic today.\n\n## Early Efforts To Conserve Materials\n\nThe recycling appeared at different times and different places, he told The Associated Press. The methods depended on the materials and the surroundings.\n\nArchaeologists have found recycled tools around the world. Experts from 10 countries met for the conference to figure out what that means.\n\nEarly humans didn't worry about pollution, said Avi Gopher, another archaeologist. But they recycled because they worried about some of the same things we do.\n\n\"Why do we recycle plastic? To conserve energy and raw materials,\" Gopher said. Recycling flint and bone means you don't have to go get more, so you save energy and materials, he said.\n\nIt could go as far back as 1.3 million years ago, said Deborah Barsky, an archaeologist. Some flint bits were found near a prehistoric lake in Spain. But she said it was hard to tell if they were really recycled.\n\n\"I think it was just something you picked up unconsciously and used to make something else,\" Barsky said. Only after years and years does this become a custom, she said.\n\n## Flint Flakes Fashioned Into Knives\n\nThat started happening about half a million years ago or later, scholars said.\n\nSome bone tools were found near Rome, said Giovanni Boschian, a geologist. They were used about 300,000 years ago by Neanderthals, he said. Boschian, like other geologists, study the history of earth through rocks.\n\n\"We find several levels of reuse and recycling,\" he said. The bones were broken, then the pieces were shaped into tools. Sometime later they were reworked to be used again, as smaller tools, he said.\n\nAxes and flint flakes were used to make smaller tools. Sometimes, even the tiny flakes that flew off the stone were used.\n\nGopher and Barkai found flint chips between 200,000 and 420,000 years old in a cave.  They had been turned into small blades to cut meat.\n\nOne-tenth of the tools found at the site were recycled in some way, Gopher said. \"It was not an occasional behavior; it was part of the way they did things, part of their way of life,\" he said.\n\n## Checking A Stone's Coloring\n\nScientists have ways to determine if a tool was recycled. They can find evidence of retouching and reuse. Or they can look at the changes in color that happen when stone gets exposed to the elements. Differences mean a fresh layer was exposed hundreds or thousands of years after the tool was made, Gopher explained.\n\nSome participants warned about making comparisons. Today's recycling is done for the environment. But prehistoric recycling was done out of need, said Daniel Amick, a professor at Loyola University.\n\nPrehistoric recycling had come up before, said Norm Catto. He's editor in chief of the journal that will publish the researchers' papers next year.\n\nPrehistoric recycling could give clues about how early humans lived and traded with each other, said Catto. Above all, he said it reflects how humans have similar responses to the challenges of life. And that holds true over thousands of years.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - It's hard to say just what Ceres is. It can be thought of as the largest known asteroid, or as the smallest dwarf planet. For a time in the 1800s, it was considered a full-fledged planet.\n\nWhatever it is, Ceres is looking more interesting these days. Astronomers, who study space and planets, have discovered water vapor - like steam - shooting off the mysterious little planetoid. That discovery could tell us something fascinating about the history of our solar system.\n\nAstronomer Michael Kippers led the study. For the first time, he said, we have \"discovered water in the asteroid belt.\"\n\nCeres sits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. That belt may have millions of asteroids in it, but Ceres is the biggest one and the first one to be discovered. It is 590 miles wide and is round like a planet. Its shape is part of why it was once considered planet-like. It was big enough for its own gravity to crush it into a round shape.\n\nBut Ceres soon lost its title of planet when astronomers realized that there were other asteroids nearby. But, while other asteroids may be rocky like Ceres, they aren't round. Typically, asteroids are lumpy.\n\n## Blasts Of Water Vapor\n\nNASA's Dawn mission visits Ceres next year. But Kuppers had been looking to do a little advance scouting before then.\n\nThe biggest question hovering around the dwarf planet: Is it filled with water, or not?\n\nBecause Ceres isn't very dense, astronomers think that it could have a large amount of water. If it did, it would likely be stored away as ice. Astronomers in the 1990s picked up signs of water in the light coming from Ceres. However, a study in 2011 could not back that claim up.\n\nTo settle the matter, Kuppers and his team turned to telescopes at the Herschel Space Observatory. They spotted clear signs of water coming from two separate dark spots. These were located on roughly opposite sides of the little world.\n\nWater was coming off Ceres at a quick pace. That made the scientists think there could be a lot of stored ice. So much, in fact, that once melted, it could add up to more fresh water than we have on Earth.\n\nThe scientists aren't exactly sure how the ice is stored on Ceres. And they don't know how it's escaping as vapor.\n\nIt could be that heat from inside the planet is the cause. This could be making the water rise up and explode up into blasts of water vapor. It could also simply be that ice on the surface is melting when the sun hits it. In any case, water on Ceres wouldn't ever be in liquid form. Liquid water requires a thicker atmosphere (like Earth's) to remain stable.\n\n## Puzzling Questions Abound\n\nWhatever is going on, the larger question remains: Why is Ceres so wet? And another puzzling question is why Ceres is so different from the asteroid named Vesta.\n\nAfter all, Ceres is roughly the same distance from the sun as the lumpy asteroid Vesta. Yet Vesta is volcanic and completely dry. So how did Ceres hold onto this water when Vesta did not?\n\nIt turns out Ceres may not be originally from this part of the solar system. It probably came from somewhere out past the \"snow line.\" Beyond this imaginary line in the solar system, ice can exist in space. There, it won't be melted by the sun's rays.\n\nCeres may have been moved around during a big migration in the solar system's history. The huge planet Jupiter, for example, is thought to have traveled long distances: first toward the sun, and then away from it. Its strong gravity yanked planets and asteroids around the solar system.\n\nThe discovery of ice on Ceres also supports the idea that asteroids aren't as dry as expected, Kuppers said. Comets are icy and are the usual suspects for having brought water to Earth. But, he said, it could just as well have been an asteroid. Asteroids are basically comets that don't have ice. But now one has been found with ice on it.\n\nAnswering more questions about Ceres will have to wait. The Herschel telescope, which is still in space, stopped working last year. But scientists won't have to wait too long: NASA's Dawn spacecraft will reach Ceres in spring 2015. It will give scientists a close look at this strange, distant world.\n\n\"I'm excited to see what Dawn is going to find out,\" said Kuppers.'"

Captive chimps, such as pets or those in research labs, are listed as threatened.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to count both as [endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). And it has proposed limiting the use of the chimpanzee, one of man's closest genetic cousins, in scientific research.\n\nAnimal rights groups praised the move. The treatment of chimps has been a hot topic of debate for years.\n\n## Used In AIDs Research\n\nIn the mid-1980s, scientists were trying to understand HIV, which causes the disease AIDS. Since humans and chimps are closely related, scientists infected chimps with HIV. The researchers hoped doing so would lead to a cure, treatment or both.\n\nAt least 198 chimps were infected with HIV. But only one developed an AIDS-like disease, and died.\n\nDespite their similarities to humans, chimps don't react to infection the same way. Researchers developed a vaccine for HIV, but it only protected chimps, not people. An article in the British Medical Journal concluded: \"When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do.\"\n\nIn early 2011, Ajit Varki of the University of California-San Diego found that chimps and humans experience disease differently. That called into question the usefulness of the chimps as human stand-ins for research.\n\n## Chimp Population Drop\n\nThere are about 2,000 captive chimpanzees in the U.S., according to Fish and Wildlife.\n\nSince 1960, the number of chimpanzees has dropped steeply. The latest count put the worldwide population of chimps at 300,000 to 430,000. They are endangered by humans moving into their habitats, and by hunting.\n\nThe capture of chimpanzees for the international pet trade is another reason for their decline. Killing a female chimp who has an infant means twice the pay for a hunter. The mother's body is sold for meat, and the infant gets sold as a pet.\n\nIf Fish and Wildlife's plan is approved, some activities involving chimps will require legal permission.\n\nFor example, buying a chimp from another state will require a permit. The import and export of chimpanzees in and out of the U.S. will also require a permit. So will activities that could harm or disturb a chimpanzee, especially in research. Selling chimpanzee blood or other medical samples between states will likewise require permits.\n\n## Research To Help Chimps\n\nSome medical research could still be allowed under the new plan. But the service said such research will be limited. Only studies that are helpful to the chimpanzee species will be allowed.\n\nPeople have argued about the use chimpanzees in science for years. But the conversation is changing. New technologies are helping researchers. Knowledge once gained only by examining a live animal now can be learned in a test tube. In addition, more and more evidence shows that chimpanzees don't work as well as human models.\n\nFeelings about animal research also have evolved in recent years. More people believe that chimps should be spared the pain and stress of research.\n\nWhen it comes to studying human diseases, the primates just make bad test subjects, said Dr. John J. Pippin of the group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, who applauded the move.'"

The feet are considered delicious in some parts of China.\n\nAnd on Friday, the southern city of Yulin held a dog meat festival. They put it on in spite of protests. Many activists complained that the dogs that were to be eaten were stolen strays and pets.\n\nAll three episodes got a lot of attention, both on news websites and on China's  version of Twitter -- Weibo. Protesters even held a pro-pup rally Thursday in Beijing. People dressed in colorful animal costumes danced in a park to support the Yulin dogs.\n\n## Growing Concern For Animal Welfare\n\nThe strong reactions showed Chinese people's growing concern for animals. This cheered animal activists. But the reactions also caused problems. Some say new ideas are threatening the ways people have celebrated in China for years.\n\n\"Thousands of dogs will be eaten at a dog meat festival in Yulin,\" wrote one Weibo user, Yu Jichun. \"As long as such a festival still exists in China, this country can't start talk about becoming civilized.\"\n\nSome people disagreed. There is a long history of eating dog meat with fruit at the start of summer. People in Yulin say it is good for health.\n\nXie Pingxiang, a local historian, said that eating dog meat goes way back. \"It doesn't break the law and has nothing to do with morality either,\" he said.\n\nGrace Gabriel works at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and she disagrees. People in China have begun to use social media to protest when they think animals are being treated cruelly.\n\n\"The online response has been terrific,\" she said. \"In the past, this kind of outrage usually came from supporters overseas. But now momentum is growing inside China.\"\n\n## Animal Protection Laws Needed\n\nSeveral cities have abandoned such events in recent years. The festivals have brought them too much bad publicity. \"I was kind of surprised that Yulin went ahead this year,\" she said. \"As more and more people keep dogs as pets, more and more people are against slaughtering them for meat.\"\n\nStill, China needs to improve its protections for animals. The country lacks laws to keep \"companion animals\" such as dogs and cats safe from abuse or death, Gabriel said.\n\nSong Jinzhang  traveled to Yulin earlier this week to look at how the people there got ready for the dog meat festival. Government inspectors came with him. They shut down an illegal dog-slaughtering facility and 48 dogs were saved. The government has stopped giving new licenses to such facilities, Song said.\n\nBut the key is \"to try to convince people not to eat dog meat.\" That will lower demand, he said.\n\nSome people said the efforts to put down the dog-meat festival might backfire.\n\n\"It might be just a small group of people who are eating dog meat,\" wrote one user on Weibo. \"But the whole thing has become a huge promotion for the local dog meat industry in Yulin. Many people who never ate dog meat before might want to come to Yulin to give it a try now.\"\n\n## Dogs Debated, Dead Dolphin Mourned\n\nPeople took sides on the dog meat festival. There was much more agreement about the dolphin.\n\nPulling a dolphin out of the water to take pictures was an unpopular idea. One Weibo user said: \"A dolphin is a type of kind and smart animal that everyone loves. ... RIP to the little dolphin.\"\n\nEarly stories blamed tourists for interfering with the rescue of the marine mammal. But the local government newspaper reported that the men lifting the animal out of the water were actually lifeguards trying to save it. One lifeguard did admit that he and the other lifeguards took photos, however.\n\nOfficials said the animal died partly because there was no rescue center nearby. Special doctors had to come from Haikou to the beach in Sanya where the dolphin was found. That's a four-hour drive.\n\n\"We are not professional wildlife rescuers,\" a lifeguard told the paper. He said that he felt like the media didn't tell his story well. \"What we can do is to try to protect the dolphin, and prevent tourists from getting close to it, and wait for the professional rescuers to come.\"'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - People in China are taking to the streets. The fast-growing country has enormous environmental problems. Its population does not trust the government. People are increasingly wired through online devices. Because of these things, it's no surprise that people are voicing their anger. They are protesting garbage dumps, chemical factories and other projects.\n\nThe latest protest was in the southern Chinese county of Boluo, where thousands of people marched through the streets Saturday. They were against a planned garbage incinerator, where garbage is burned and discarded. Police arrested 24 people, which was fewer than expected. Observers took it as a sign that the Chinese government will let some protests like this take place.\n\nPollution is the bad thing about China's growing power as a country. Pollution from factories has ruined about one-fifth of China's farmland. Air pollution levels in Beijing are 40 times higher than what is safe to breathe. Dangerous levels of heavy metals keep showing up in China's rice. Three-fourths of the nation's lakes and rivers are heavily polluted.\n\n## Finding Ways To Gather\n\nIn China, there is no freedom to gather in public. Many people feel helpless in confronting these larger problems. Yet more of them are gathering in the streets. These people protest new projects in their communities they feel are threatening.\n\nIn April, hundreds of people in a city near Boluo clashed with police. They were opposed to a planned chemical plant. Plants like these have become controversial in China in the past few years.\n\nIn May, a protest near Shanghai also turned into a fight. It was against a new waste incinerator. Ten demonstrators and 29 police officers were injured.\n\nSaturday's protest in Boluo was organized over mobile devices and social media. Two days before the protest, messages went out on Weibo. It is like China's Twitter. The messages told people to gather at a city square at 9 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\"For our families, reject cancer!\" one message said.\n\nThe messages worked. Video from the protest shows that thousands of people marched through Boluo.\n\n## Garbage Piles Are Growing\n\nDealing with garbage is becoming a problem for local governments. Chinese people are buying more and more things. China generates about 200 million metric tons of solid waste every year. In 2004, it passed the United States as the world's largest producer of garbage. By 2030, it is expected to make twice as much waste as the United States.\n\nSome experts say incinerators are the best way to get rid of garbage. In crowded parts of China, landfill space is limited. Nie Yongfeng is a professor of the environment. He said new incinerators in China work as good, if not better, than the ones in Europe. People against the incinerators use old information to create fear, he said.\n\nOthers say the government has not been clear with its numbers. It knows how much pollution the waste burners create, but those numbers haven't been released to the public. \"It is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely,\" said Lin Youzhu. She works on solid waste for Friends of Nature, China's oldest environmental group.\n\n## Taking A Stand Against Pollution\n\nBy the end of 2013, 176 waste incinerators were being used in China. There were 74 more being built. She said the government helps pay for incinerator construction. This is hurting China's strong network of recycling. The government \"pays little attention to reducing waste at the source and puts all its attention into disposal,\" she said.\n\nJudith Shapiro is a professor studying the Chinese environment. She said it is good to see Chinese people standing together against worsening air, water and soil conditions. She is the author of the 2012 book \"China's Environmental Challenges.\"\n\nBut the protests are usually in richer communities on China's eastern coast. That raises the risk that the government will just move incinerators and other controversial projects away from the coast. They could end up in the poorer areas in China.'"

            "title": "Polluted air cuts the length of a lifetime in China, new study shows",
            "text": "b\"BEIJING - Dirty air decreases human lifetimes, says a new study. Its research shows that lives are 5.5 years shorter in northern China than in the south. Experts believe this is because of air pollution - the dirt and dust floating in the atmosphere.\n\nThe study was published on Monday. It examined the air in 90 Chinese cities between 1981 and 2000. This information was then compared with death rates in 145 places across the country from 1991 to 2000.\n\nOther studies have established strong links between air pollution and ill health. And many experts have tried to work out how poor air quality affects people in China.\n\nSome say this new research proves that pollution lowers life expectancy, and may shock both politicians and the public. China used to be a poor country that mostly depended on farming. In the past few decades, it quickly changed to a richer, booming land full of factories and big cities. Some people argue China is sacrificing the health of its citizens to produce more goods and make more money.\n\n## Both Sides Of Huai River Studied\n\nIn China, the researchers found an ideal place to look at the effects of air pollution. The Huai River flows through the center of the country.\n\nThe Chinese government once gave people north of the river free coal to burn in winter. This created large amounts of smoke and pollution. But those who lived south of the river received no fuel at all. These people may have been colder, but they lived in a place with much better air.\n\nThe experts compared the people south of the river to those who lived north of the river to study the effects of pollution on health. Those south of the river lived longer lives.\n\nAir pollution is measured by TSPs. These are tiny specks of dust, smoke or dirt carried in the air. They can cause people to develop diseases.\n\n## Cleaner Air Needed\n\nMichael Greenstone is one of the authors of the new study. He found that there were many more TSPs north of the river than south of it.\n\nPeople also died around 5.5 years earlier in the north. Experts believe this is because citizens in the north were exposed to more pollution. Many of the deaths in the north were caused by heart and lung problems. These are often caused by TSPs and air pollution.\n\nThe researchers say that 500 million people altogether lost 2.5 billion years from their lives. This was just during the 1990s.\n\nYuyu Chen of Peking University also wrote the study. He said that air pollution in China is damaging human health much more than experts believed. Chen wants people to take air pollution seriously and write new laws to make the air cleaner.\n\n## Trading Health For Money\n\nDirty air is a serious concern in China. The capital city Beijing had some of its worst air pollution ever in January. This was caused by the weather and smoke from burning coal.\n\nThis pollution meant outdoor activities had to be cancelled as they were too dangerous. Airplane flights were stopped and highways were closed. Countless people were sent to hospitals. Regions up to 1,100 miles away from Beijing were affected. And more terrible air hit Beijing in June.\n\nChinese people have protested about air pollution in recent years. Lots of them are concerned about what this bad air means for their health.\n\nChina's government has taken several emergency measures against the problem. It ordered factories and construction sites to close. It demanded that heavy industries such as steel manufacturing use the most modern machinery. This cuts down on the amount of pollution created.\n\nThe government has asked industries to reduce the amount of pollution they release into the air. Some companies have to cut down their emissions by 30 percent by the end of 2017.\n\n## Slow Improvement Seen\n\nBut some people think that the companies are more interested in money than stopping pollution. These critics believe that the dirty air will improve very, very slowly.\n\nMany Chinese cities have average TSP readings of 200 to 300 micrograms. In the U.S., the average is 20 to 30 micrograms. Chen and his research team say that pollution is more dangerous when people spend more time in areas with high TSP readings.\n\nThe researcher believes that every extra 100 micrograms of TSPs in the air cuts life expectancy by three years.\""

            "title": "The climate is changing, just look at the mummies",
            "text": "\tAbout 7,000 years ago, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru. Their lives revolved around fishing in the Pacific Ocean. Yet, just behind them, farther inland, was a desert - the Atacama. It has often been called the driest place on the planet.\n\nThe Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in how they buried their people. They created the oldest-known mummies on Earth, beating the Egyptians by several thousand years. In 1917, Chinchorro mummies were first discovered in the Atacama Desert.\n\nThe Chinchorro mummified their dead much like the Egyptians did. Yet, there were some differences. \"The Egyptians considered only kings and other (important) citizens worthy of mummification,\" wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies. But, \"the Chinchorro mummified everyone, regardless of age or status.\"\n\n## Newer Mummies Are Not In Great Shape\n\nSince 1917, hundreds of mummies have been dug up, and more are being uncovered all the time. But lately, there has been a problem. They have started to decay.\n\nMore than 100 are stored at a museum of the Universidad de Tarapac\\xc3\\xa1 in Arica, Chile. \"The tissue change is reflected in the appearance of dark and bright spots,\" Marcela Sepulveda, an archaeologist at the Universidad, explained.\n\nThe mummies in the museum have been slow to decay, but outdoors, mummies are being discovered already damaged, Sepulveda said. When you dig up the mummies, you can see they are already harmed, she said. And the suspected reason? A changing climate.\n\nThe Earth is slowly getting warmer and storm patterns have changed. Scientists blame humans burning oil, gas and coal for some of the changes.\n\n## More Rain Is Not Always Good\n\nArica is often called the driest place on Earth. Now locals say that is changing. According to Sepulveda, the city has seen more rain, snow and humidity lately. In fact, weather records from 1971 to 2000 suggest it has become wetter lately.\n\nThis may not be a change that can definitely be blamed on global climate change caused by humans, cautioned Ralph Mitchell. He is a Harvard University microbiologist. But the climate is changing all the same. Chilean scientists have noticed that \"the place is foggy a lot more than it ever was,\" Mitchell said. He teamed up with the Chilean researchers to figure out what was ailing the mummies.\n\nMany mummies found in the 1980s had no problems until 10 years ago. At that point they started to fall apart, he said. That alone suggests climate may be part of the reason for what is happening.\n\nSo Mitchell and two other researchers from Harvard collaborated with Sepulveda. They wanted to figure out what was going on. They had a theory: more moisture from the air had enabled bacteria to start to eat the ancient relics.\n\nThey studied samples of mummy skin and dried pig skin, in various conditions. They examined which tiny organisms were living on and in the skin. Mitchell said they found that bacteria was taking advantage of a more humid environment. The bacteria was using the skin as food and starting \"to break it down.\"\n\n## Not Only Mummies At Risk\n\nThe story of the Chinchorro mummies illustrates just how at risk many cultural artifacts may be to a changing climate - whether it is caused by humans or not. It is something that the United Nations (U.N.) has thought about for some time. Its UNESCO agency names certain places as World Heritage sites because of their importance to nature or culture. A 2007 report from the U.N. agency noted that climate change is affecting many sites and will likely touch \"many more, both natural and cultural, in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development is also concerned about how climate change can affect cultural sites. It describes buildings in the medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India. They were \"constructed in a high altitude desert environment\" and are suffering from increases in rain.\n\nArchaeology magazine listed yet another example. The burial mounds of Scythian warlords, called \"kurgans,\" had been frozen and preserved in permafrost near Siberia, Russia. In this case, it was ice, not desert, that had preserved remains for such a wonderfully long time. Now the Arctic is thawing. As the ice protecting them melts, these irreplaceable artifacts could be lost.\n\nMitchell suspects there could soon be a new climate victim: outdoor marble statues, such as those in Greece and Rome.\n\n## Still A Mystery\n\nSo we may not know exactly what is happening in Arica, Chile. We also may not know whether humans are to blame. We do know these artifacts and sites are being damaged. The reason many of these sites have been so well preserved for so long is that they were unaffected by climate. The surroundings stayed the same.\n\nIf the climate continues to change, the world could lose some of its history.'"

            "title": "PRO/CON: When should Congress make major climate change laws?",
            "text": "b\"### PRO: Now would be a good time\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. - In a new report, a group of experts said the Earth is definitely getting warmer. It's based on information from many different sources.\n\n[Global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) can cause changes to our climate and weather. These changes could have a big effect on our lives.\n\nThe study also found that humans are probably the biggest cause of climate change. It happens when when we burn oil, coal, or gas. When we burn those for fuel it makes greenhouse gases. Those greenhouse gases get trapped in the air. And then they heat up the Earth. And that can change our weather.\n\nBut, countries can't agree to lower greenhouse gases. A big climate change meeting just ended in Poland. Not much came out of it. Yet, these gases are dangerous risks to the world's businesses, its environment and people's health.\n\n## Have To Start Somewhere\n\nNot much has happened because of the United States. We produce more greenhouse gases than any other country per person. And we haven't stepped up to take the lead on fixing things.\n\nBut China hasn't either. China has been growing quickly and now produces the most greenhouse gases of any country in total.\n\nHow could the United States slow down global climate change and make its effects less serious?\n\nPassing a national climate change law would be a good start.\n\nThe United States has done things to slow climate change. More than half of the states have made laws. More than a thousand U.S. cities have also. The laws include promoting new fuels made from things like vegetables, instead of oil. And they've passed laws so people don't waste energy. And to get more people to take trains instead of cars.\n\nThe Obama government has done a lot too by giving billions of dollars to develop new energy technologies. These new types don't burn oil. Instead, they use sources that don't pollute or run out, such as wind and sun rays.\n\nThe government also got car companies to make new cars that go farther for each gallon of gas they use. That way they will burn less gas.\n\n## Showing We're Serious About It\n\nThe government is also making rules that should shift the U.S. away from using coal toward cleaner forms of energy.\n\nYet the new rules are not enough. Our nation needs to pass a big law that affects everyone. Then, other countries might help more.\n\nA national climate change plan would send a strong signal to the world that the United States takes climate change seriously.\n\nBut how can our leaders in Washington pass a climate change law when they can barely get along? It is not likely right now. And it won't happen as long as some of our leaders don't believe in climate change. And some of our leaders are good friends with oil companies which don't want people to stop using oil.\n\nBut, Congress must try to design a national climate change law. And it should do it soon. It needs to hold hearings, listen to experts and review the evidence.\n\nCongress should use all its tools to find ways to appeal to both sides. Clearly, this will be a hard battle. But, we must try.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n> Michael E.

This op-ed was adapted by Newsela.\n\n### CON: Later would make more sense\n\nXIAN, China - Our leaders in Congress should not make a big climate change bill in 2014. It would be a waste of time. It doesn't need to. We have already cut by a lot how much greenhouse gas we put out.\n\nAnd that's without Congress doing anything at all.\n\nGreenhouse gases are what makes the planet hotter. But we are releasing less greenhouse gases now because we started using more natural gas. It's cleaner than oil or coal. And since money has been tight and jobs are scarce, people are not driving so much nor shopping a lot. It means cars and factories are burning less fuel.\n\nCongress shouldn't jump in. They could easily mess things up.\n\n## Cheaper And Better Fixes Later\n\nIt's better to wait. Cutting back on greenhouse gasses is expensive right now. Lowering the amount of greenhouse gases will be cheaper in the future when new technologies are invented.\n\nThink about how much cellphones have changed over time. Cellphones used to be the size of bricks and they were only for the rich. Then the technology improved and prices dropped.\n\nToday, many kids have iPhones. That same type of improvement will happen with greenhouse gases. We'll have new technology soon. It will make fixing climate change cheaper and better in the future.\n\nThe United States can't stop greenhouse gases alone. And it would cost a huge amount of money. We shouldn't pay for it by ourselves. It will hurt U.S. jobs and businesses.\n\nChina and India are growing fast. They're making more greenhouse gasses. Those extra greenhouse gasses would be much more than any cuts we could make now.\n\nFor example, the Chinese own far fewer cars per person than the U.S. They even own fewer than we did per person in 1920.\n\nThe Chinese will drive as much as us someday. When they do, they'll have 20 times the number of cars they have today. That's because they have so many more people than us.\n\nThe Chinese are using a lot more electricity too. New coal power plants are opening there all the time.\n\n## Not During An Election Year\n\nCutting greenhouse gases by ourselves is pointless. And it would make it harder to reach an agreement with China and India.\n\nThose countries will definitely ask for cuts from the U.S. and Europe. They won't cut their own greenhouse gases without that.\n\nSo, we shouldn't cut our greenhouse gases. At least not before an agreement is reached. If we do, we will have to make even more cuts to get China and India to sign on.\n\nEnergy affects every part of our lives. So, a law will take careful thought. We need our leaders to put out clear-cut plans. And we need to hear them talk about them in public. Then voters can pick what changes they want to see.\n\nAnd, leaders in Congress are hardly even speaking to each other. It's not likely they will be able to come to an agreement.\n\nSo, Congress won't be able to pass a big law for a while. Also, they're running for elections in 2014. They're going to be busy raising money.\n\nThey shouldn't start talking about a bill right before an election. It could result in a really bad law.\n\nWhat we need is more careful thinking on the matter. We don't need to act fast.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n> Andrew Morriss holds the D.

            "text": "\tIt has long been believed that people act more violent when it gets really hot. But few people have done a real scientific study to test the idea that high temperatures can lead to fighting.\n\nNow three researchers have done just such a study. Their work included observations from ancient history, Major League Baseball and traffic jams.\n\nThe University of California researchers pulled together information from dozens of studies. They concluded that there could be as much as 56 percent more war and rioting by 2050 because of higher temperatures and extreme rainfall patterns. The weather changes are predicted by climate scientists.\n\nViolence between individuals might rise too. The researchers said crimes like murder and domestic abuse could rise 16 percent. Their study was published by the journal _Science_.\n\n## Climate Change And Fighting\n\nThe researchers said that there was strong evidence to link [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) and fighting. This was true across the world, they said.\n\nHow hot do scientists think the Earth will get? The study assumes the global temperature will rise at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 50 years. That figure is based on information from scientists who study climates.\n\nThe researchers also assumed that people would do little to adapt to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns.\n\nThe team examined 60 papers. The papers covered studies on weather, economics, government, the human mind and other fields.\n\nSome of the topics covered minor incidents, like road rage between two drivers. Others covered major conflicts, such as war between countries.\n\nResearchers in one case held up traffic at a hot Phoenix corner. They wanted to see who would get angry and honk their horns more: drivers in cars with or without air conditioning.\n\n## \"The Result Is Alarming\"\n\nScientists in another study looked at Major League Baseball. They wanted to see if a pitcher was more likely to throw at the batter when it got hotter.\n\nAnother group used information from tree rings in Southeast Asia. The goal? To figure out how a severe drought led to the fall of an Asian kingdom 600 years ago.\n\nNo matter where in the world they looked, the researchers said they saw a link between temperature, rain and conflict. This was true no matter the year. Large-scale group conflict could rise 28 to 56 percent over the next 37 years, they decided. Personal violence could increase 8 to 16 percent.\n\n\"The result is alarming,\" study co-author Marshall Burke said. He specializes in how climate change affects access to food. But mankind can still make adjustments that could make climate change less of a problem, he said.\n\nThe authors say they can only guess why heat and rainfall changes would make humans more violent.\n\n## More Research And Planning Needed\n\nOne traditional explanation is that climate shifts hit farm-based societies very hard. It becomes much more difficult for those societies to make money.\n\n\"People are more likely to take up arms\" when the way their society makes money is threatened, study leader Solomon Hsiang said.\n\nHsiang and the other researchers make no attempt to establish a clear cause. They say there might be a physical link between heat and acting on anger. But they are not biologists. What they want is for their work to cause more research and planning in the face of global warming.\n\n\"We like to compare it to smoking,\" Burke said. \"In the 1930s scientists were figuring out there was this really strong relationship between smoking and lung cancer.\" But it took many years to figure out just what precisely linked smoking to cancer.'"

            "text": "\tFor the first time ever, humans have landed a spacecraft on a comet.\n\nScientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully landed Philae, a mobile laboratory, on a comet named 67P on Wednesday. They hope studying a comet up close will unlock mysteries about the beginning of our solar system. Comets like 67P may contain material left over from when our solar system began.\n\n## Design, Build, Fly\n\nThis project began in 1993 when the ESA started designing and building a spaceship and lander. They had another comet in mind, but had to change to 67P after the launch was delayed.\n\nScientists said the spacecraft named Philae would land on the comet. It was attached to Rosetta, a different spacecraft that could fly through space. Rosetta, with Philae attached, was launched in 2004.\n\nThe Rosetta orbiter has been chasing 67P through space for 10 years.\n\nThe orbiter traveled through space for seven years before ESA scientists put it in a three-year hibernation to save energy. The orbiter went to sleep during this time. This January, alarm clocks on the spacecraft woke it up to prepare for landing.\n\n## Getting Ready To Land\n\nRosetta has been flying with comet 67P as it heads toward the sun, for the last three months. Rosetta was looking for a good landing site for Philae.\n\nThis week, the final part of the mission began: landing Philae on the comet. Early Wednesday morning, three screws turned and the Philae lander detached. It began a 14-mile free-fall to the surface of the comet.\n\nPhilae was falling slowly. The comet, about the size of a mountain, does have its own gravitational pull, but it is much weaker than Earth's. The gravity of the comet is only about 1/60,000 of the gravity here. Philae fell much slower toward the comet than it would have on Earth. Scientists thought it could take Philae seven to 10 hours to reach 67P.\n\nOnce it hit the surface, Philae sent a message to the Rosetta orbiter saying where it had landed. Rosetta sent the message on to Earth. The message took 28 minutes to cross 300 million miles of space.\n\nAt the mission command center in Germany, scientists cheered as they heard the news.\n\n## Fingers Were Crossed\n\nThere were many chances for the Philae landing to fail, the ESA had warned. Philae needed to be upright to work properly, and many boulders on the comet made for a difficult surface on which to land.\n\nThough the landing went smoothly, it was not perfect. Philae was supposed to send out two harpoons - pointed metal spears - to attach itself to the comet. ESA scientists said those harpoons did not fire. Whether to try firing the harpoons again is a \"tricky\" decision, a lead ESA scientist said. Because the comet has such low gravity, firing the harpoons could shoot the lander back into space.\n\n## Seeking Solar System Secrets\n\nThe ESA scientists believe they can learn a lot from comet 67P. They want to learn what comets are made of. They want to know if comets might have brought water to a newly formed Earth. They want to investigate the inside of a comet. They are curious why the surface of a comet is so dark black.\n\nThey also believe comets can answer bigger questions about where it all came from. The nucleus, or solid center, of a comet may contain material from the earliest days of the solar system. It is possible that life on Earth happened because of comets. These space scientists hope to learn more, up close, about where our solar system came from.'"

            "text": "\tDEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. - The cracking sounds were loud as an ankle-deep, frozen lake broke apart under sunny skies.\n\nThe normally dry lake bed here in Death Valley National Park is known as \"the Racetrack Playa.\" A playa is an area of flat dried-up land. On most days, Death Valley is the hottest, driest place on Earth. On this day though, the playa was anything but dry.\n\nAs cousins Richard Norris and James Norris watched, a light wind began moving huge sheets of ice across the surface of the water. Soon, that ice was ramming into large rocks. Pushed by the ice, the rocks began to slide across the lake's slick, muddy bottom.\n\n\"My God, Jim, it's happening,\" Richard Norris yelled, as his cousin grabbed a camera.\n\n## Rock Trails In The Dirt\n\nTheir photos, taken last Dec. 21, solved a mystery that has long puzzled scientists: What is it that moves rocks across the flat dirt of the Racetrack Playa?\n\nThe rocks that dot the playa's surface are not small. Some weigh 600 pounds or more.\n\nThe proof that the rocks are moving is what they leave behind: trails in the dirt. The trails are cut sharply into the ground - but no other tracks are visible.\n\nVarious explanations of how the rocks move have been suggested over the years. Some thought it might be hurricane-force winds blowing while the playa's surface was covered with rain water. Others suggested that perhaps small rafts of ice carried the rocks across the mud, or even that UFOs from outer space were responsible.\n\nHowever, until that day last December, no one had been able to prove anything.\n\n\"I'm amazed,\" James Norris said. \"In a place where rainfall averages 2 inches a year, rocks are being shoved around\" by ice.\n\n## What Has To Happen\n\nScientists have been studying the moving rocks since 1948. The first study suggested they were driven by small whirlwinds, which are also called dust devils.\n\nOne reason the mystery remained is that the rocks only move occasionally. They can stay still for many years until a particular series of natural events occurs.\n\nThe first necessary step is rain falling on the playa. Next, temperatures must fall low enough to freeze the water before it evaporates. Then the sun has to come out and thaw the ice. Once the ice breaks into chunks, a wind has to spring up to move it across the shallow water. Even a light wind is enough to get the ice moving.\n\nRichard Norris and James Norris are both scientists. The two began trying to solve the mystery of the moving stones in 2011.\n\nOver the next two years, they placed various measuring devices around the playa. The devices were to show how much and in what direction the rocks moved.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the two cousins returned to inspect their devices. \"We found the playa covered with ice,\" Richard Norris recalled. \"We also noticed fresh rock trails.\"\n\nThe following afternoon, \"a light wind kicked up and the ice started cracking,\" Richard Norris said. Suddenly, everything \"unfolded before our eyes.\"\n\n## The Ice Does It!\n\nThe cousins later learned that a rare winter storm had occurred in late November that had dropped rain and snow on the playa.\n\nFollowing that storm, the playa was transformed into a shallow lake. The new lake froze overnight when temperatures dropped. On sunny days, the ice began to break into flat blocks of ice. As light winds sprung up, the blocks of ice pushed the stones, which began to move.\n\nJames Norris' photos made everything clear: Sheets of ice hundreds of feet across and as thin as 1/4-inch thick blew into rocks. Pushed by the ice, the rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud. Their paths were determined by the direction and force of the winds. Once the lake disappeared, those paths would remain as trails.\n\nThe Norris cousins are not only scientists themselves. Both are also the sons of well-known scientists. Both of their fathers are no longer alive.\n\n\"Wouldn't our fathers have loved to have known this?\" James Norris said of their discovery.'"

            "text": "\t### PRO: To help the environment, we should eat less meat\n\nPeople around the world are eating more and more meat these days. As a result, giant farms are raising more and more animals. \n\nCattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and other livestock give off methane gas. The gas is released as their bodies break down the food they eat. \n\nMethane gas is one of the greenhouse gases. Other greenhouse gases are created when fuels such as coal and oil are burned.\n\nWhen greenhouse gases are released, they remain in the air. They build up in the atmosphere and trap heat. Over time, they have caused a steep rise in average global temperatures. \n\n## Melting Icecaps, Dry Riverbeds\n\nThe increase in temperature that greenhouse gases cause is known as global warming, or climate change. It has led to many serious problems. \n\nFor example, rising temperatures have made giant icecaps melt. The water released by this melting ice is causing sea levels to rise. Coastal shorelines and island nations are being swallowed up by the rising waters. \n\nIn other parts of the world, the problem is the opposite. Hot weather is drying up lakes and rivers. Scientists say many places may soon have too little water.\n\nOne way Americans can help is by changing their eating habits. \n\nHuge farms produce most of our meat. These companies say beef, lamb, chicken and pork are good food choices. They are not, because the way farm animals are raised is bad for the planet.\n\nLivestock produce a big part of the world's greenhouse gas. The situation is not getting any better. Indeed, it is quickly getting worse.\n\nThe big livestock companies are trying to convince us that eating meat is not part of the problem. They have even suggested that vegetarians cause more greenhouse gas buildup than meat eaters. Nothing could be more ridiculous.\n\n## What Some Studies Say\n\nNew studies show that half the world's greenhouse gas is created by livestock. Farm animals produce more greenhouse gas than all the cars, trucks, airplanes, trains and ships in the world put together.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an agency of the U.S. government responsible for protecting the environment. The environment is the natural world we all live in.\n\nLike many scientists, the EPA believes methane gas released by livestock is a serious problem. It says such gas accounts for one-third of all greenhouse gas created by U.S. agriculture. Greenhouse gases are also produced when farmers burn fuels to power their tractors and other machines.\n\nNo one is saying we should never eat another hamburger or steak again. However, the United States and other rich countries do need to eat less meat.\n\nGetting people to eat less meat must be part of the push for cleaner farming. Farming has to change so it does less damage to the environment.\n\nEating less meat is not only good for the environment. Doctors say it is also good for your health.\n\n## Making A Small Sacrifice\n\nThe decision to be a vegetarian or a meat eater should be your own, though. Governments should not try to force people to eat one way or the other.\n\nWhen it comes to livestock and the environment, it is far better to stick to the methane gas problem. There is no need to throw in health concerns.\n\nAlso, government plans to tax meat go too far. The government should not punish people for eating meat.\n\nThe big livestock companies say there is no link between climate change and farm animals. Many scientists do not agree with them. One study found that eating just a half cup less of meat a day would greatly lower the amount of methane gas released.\n\nWe can all make that small sacrifice. It is easy to do and will help save our planet.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: The newly elected president of the Tampa Bay Press Club, Wayne Madsen is a progressive commentator whose articles have appeared in leading newspapers throughout the U.S. and Europe.

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\n\n### CON: Eating less meat might actually hurt the environment\n\nRecently, many of the world's leaders met in Paris. Together, they reached an agreement on what must be done to fight global warming. Each country agreed it would work hard to lower the amount of greenhouse gas released every year.\n\nSome people are disappointed with the Paris agreement, however. They feel it does not go far enough. \n\nOne of the big things such people want is a tax on meat. The added tax would make meat more expensive. As a result, many people might decide to start eating less of it. The change would be good for the planet, they say. \n\nSupporters of the tax say raising livestock produces too much greenhouse gas. They believe it is worse for the environment than raising other kinds of food. \n\n## This Idea Won't Work\n\nTax supporters say we could greatly slow climate change if we can change how people eat. If fewer people ate meat, farms would raise fewer animals. Then, less methane gas would be released and global warming would slow.\n\nThe idea sounds reasonable. However, it would not actually work. People who say eating less meat is the answer are not thinking things through. They are not looking closely at what would happen if many people switched away from meat and began eating more of the other kinds of food.\n\nFor instance, many health food fans like to use almond milk in place of cow milk. However, growing almonds requires a great deal of water. Almonds can be bad for the planet, too. Growing them wastes a good deal of water at a time when much of the world's water supply is shrinking.\n\nFor years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has pushed Americans to eat less red meat, and more fruits, vegetables and grains. Doctors have long said eating that way is more healthy. \n\nSuppose Americans did follow these suggestions. What effect would it have on the level of greenhouse gases?\n\n## More, Not Less, Greenhouse Gas\n\nScientists at Carnegie Mellon University looked at just that question. They found that a shift toward eating more fruits and vegetables would actually raise the amount of greenhouse gas released. \n\nThe reason is that growing fruits and vegetables requires a lot of machinery. The machinery needs fuel to run. When that fuel is burned, greenhouse gases are released. In the end, more greenhouse gas would be produced than what farm animals cause.\n\nThe British newspaper The Independent put it simply. When it comes to greenhouse gases, lettuce is \"three times worse than bacon.\" Being a vegetarian \"could be bad for the environment,\" the paper said.\n\nGrowing fruits and vegetables also uses up a huge amount of water. Farmers would both use more water and burn more fuel if they switched to growing more fruits and vegetables. \n\nIn the end, raising farm animals for meat is both less wasteful and less harmful for the environment. Of course, people still need their fruits and vegetables. However, it would not be healthier for the planet if we all began to eat less meat.\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon study is not the only one to challenge the idea that meat is bad for the environment. A University of Michigan study also found that growing more fruits and vegetables would raise the level of greenhouse gasses. \n\nThe truth is, science does not supports the idea of a meat tax. It also does not support a move away from eating meat. Neither step will help the environment. Indeed, both are likely to make the greenhouse gas problem even worse.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Jeff Stier is director of the risk analysis division of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.

            "text": "\t### PRO: Electric cars good for the environment\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. - Electric cars are selling fast in the United States, but the government still has to give car makers money to help them out. People who buy electric cars get money from the government as well.\n\nIt would be a bad idea to \"pull the plug\" on money to help electric cars.\n\nIf the government stopped helping, car companies would lose money when they sell electric cars. The government made rules so that cars would go further using less fuel. But making new cars costs car makers money, so the government gives car companies money to make the rules easier to handle.\n\nThe rules are a challenge to automakers. Between now and 2025, cars must go longer distances on a gallon of gas. New cars and trucks average less than 30 miles per gallon (mpg) right now. They must increase that to more than 50 mpg.\n\n## Helping The Environment\n\nAnd more cars that don't burn gas must be sold. In California and nine other states, one out of every seven new cars will have to be electric. Right now they are just a tiny amount of the cars for sale in those states.\n\nThese rules were made for excellent reasons. The U.S. buys oil from other countries. But things sometimes go bad in those parts of the world, and it could be hard to get oil. If the U.S. buys less oil from other countries, businesses here won't have to worry as much about a steady oil supply.\n\nThe rules are also meant to help the environment. Burning gas might make the earth hotter. That can possibly [change the climate](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).\n\nThe rules may be too demanding. But, the government doesn't plan to look at them again until 2017.\n\nIt takes a long time to launch new types of cars. So, this is the wrong time to change anything. But, the desire to do so makes sense.\n\nPresident Obama wanted there to be one million plug-in cars on the road by 2015. That goal was too hopeful. It won't happen in time.\n\nHowever, sales of plug-in cars are growing quickly. Even faster than traditional hybrids, which run on gas and batteries. Sales are growing faster than the Toyota Prius did at first. It was the first hybrid.\n\n## Second Generation Coming\n\nWe should learn from the city of Oslo in Norway. In that European city, many people choose plug-in cars over cars that use gas.\n\nIt is true that plug-in cars aren't for most Americans. They're too expensive. They don't go very far before they have to be plugged in and charged. The Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla are some of the most popular plug-in cars.\n\nBut, car makers have learned a lot during the four years that plug-ins have been around. The second generation of plug-in cars is about to come out. Every automaker will be offering a plug-in car.\n\nCar companies are trying to beat each other to get customers. New plug-in vehicles should be able to go farther before they need to be recharged. They should also be cheaper than the older ones.\n\nThe money from the government is important. It will let us see if this new technology will work. Electric cars could be a breakthrough. They could help U.S. business.\n\nSomeday, electric vehicles must be sold without help from the government. People should even pay a little extra for electric cars to keep roads in good shape. Owners of gasoline-powered cars already pay extra to the government when they buy gas.\n\nBut the government should keep supporting electric cars until 2017. Then it can decide if it wants to stop helping them.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER\\n> John Graham is dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs and served as administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 2001 to 2006.

But that's not stopping it from trying. The government gives money to people who buy electric cars. The idea is to give people a nudge when they are shopping for a car.\n\nBut electric cars aren't for everyone.\n\nPeople who drive electric cars do not have children. Or, they don't plan to have any.\n\n## Too Expensive For Families\n\nElectric cars aren't good for families. They're too expensive. They're too small. And, they don't go far enough before they need to be recharged. When the battery dies it has to be plugged in to charge.\n\nHaving children is very expensive. The average cost of raising a child for the first 18 years is over $240,000. Then, add the cost of college and each child can be more than $340,000.\n\nBut, people who make lots of money have fewer children than poor people.\n\nAnd rich people are the ones who can afford expensive electric cars, so they don't even need the help from the government to buy a car.\n\nAn independent government agency compared the lifetime cost of different types of cars.  Electric cars and plug-in hybrid cars cost $12,000 more to own than a gas car or regular hybrid, which doesn't get plugged in. Hybrid cars run on gas and electric batteries. Some can be plugged in to charge, like an electric car. Other hybrid cars can't be plugged in. Their batteries get charged when the car's wheels move.\n\nThe government awards people $7,500 for buying an electric car. But, even that amount doesn't make up for how much more they cost to own.  The amount the government awards would need to be $4,500 more to make up the difference.\n\nBut no amount of government action can fix other problems.\n\n-These cars are too small. Space is lost because the battery takes up a lot of room. They're also made smaller so that they weigh less. Lighter cars can travel for longer before they need to be recharged.\n\n-Most all-electric cars can't go more than 100 miles on a charge.\n\n-Charges can take hours and leave people dependent on the power grid. That could make charging a problem since the grid is getting less and less reliable.\n\nElectric-gas hybrid cars run on gas and electric batteries. They are a better alternative to all-electric cars, but they are still small and expensive.\n\n## Doesn't Help The Environment\n\nElectric cars need to be recharged often. That's not good for families. Electric cars are best for drivers who use them the same way every day. Otherwise they could run out of power at bad times.\n\nBut kids can be all over the place. They may have band, soccer, football, and dance practices that change a lot. They sometimes get sick and need to be taken home. They even have to stay late at school sometimes.\n\nThe government is spending $7.5 billion over 10 years on electric cars. But, it won't result in much. It will just support cars that only a few people will buy.\n\nJ.D. Power surveys people about the things they own. It says that electric car owners see helping the environment and nature as the \"most important benefit\" of such cars. But even here, electric vehicles fail.\n\nA report found that building electric vehicles produces a lot of harmful gasses. It release double the amount of bad gasses into the air as building traditional automobiles. These gasses are believed to cause climate change which can hurt the environment and nature.\n\nAnd, electric vehicles have batteries. But those batteries are charged with electricity from burning oil and other fuels. And their batteries contain toxic chemicals.\n\nThe first electric car was made 116 years ago.\n\nElectric cars haven't gotten very far since then. It's time to pull the plug on government subsidies.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER \\n> David A. Ridenour is president of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think-tank.

            "text": "\tSAN ISIDRO, El Salvador - Somewhere trapped in the earth below Francisco Pineda's feet is about 1.4 million ounces of gold. Pineda wants it to remain there.\n\nHe does not want Australian mining company OceanaGold to dig up the precious metal.\n\nThe El Dorado mine, where the digging for gold would take place, is located near the Lempa River. The river is El Salvador's most important waterway.\n\n\"What will happen with the water? To separate the gold and silver, they'll use cyanide,\" Pineda said. Cyanide is a deadly poison. Pineda, a famous environmentalist, worries it will end up in the river or in the water people drink.\n\n## Mining Would Hurt The Environment\n\nThere are many in El Salvador who share Pineda's views. Their Central American country is tiny, but very crowded. They say it cannot absorb the damage that would result from mining.\n\nYet the choice is not theirs. Nor is it the choice of their government, which opposes the mining as well.\n\nIn fact, what happens at the El Dorado gold mine will not be decided in El Salvador at all. The decision will be made by three judges in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe three judges belong to a tribunal, or court, few people have heard of. Sometime early in 2015, they will decide if OceanaGold has the right to mine at El Dorado.\n\n## Deciding What Is Fair\n\nOceanaGold says the Salvadoran government has not acted fairly. In 2008, the government announced that mining would no longer be allowed. OceanaGold's lawyers say it had no right to do that. They claim the government was ignoring a Salvadoran law from 1999 that permitted mining.\n\nThe current president of El Salvador, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, is very much against mining. So were the two presidents before him.\n\n\"Everyone says that El Salvador has a wealth underground, having golden valleys and basins of silver,\" President Ceren said. \"But what does it mean if we allow it to be removed? It will destroy our lives.\"\n\nIt might not matter that the Salvadoran government is against mining. The tribunal may decide it should be permitted anyway. They will be considering laws that cover the rights of companies doing business in other countries.\n\nSome people feel such laws are a bad thing. They say the laws give courts too much power over entire countries and their leaders.\n\n\"For us, it is very tough that three judges will be deciding this case,\" Pineda said. \"They've never been here. They've never asked us what we want. It is really ugly that someone is deciding our future without asking our opinion.\"\n\n## A Mine Would Bring Jobs\n\nIf OceanaGold wins its case, El Salvador will be in difficult, no-win situation. It will have two choices: allow OceanaGold to mine or pay the company the $301 million it says it would have earned from the gold.\n\nOceanaGold says people should not worry about its mining. It says it can mine for gold without poisoning the water supply.\n\nNot everyone in the small city of San Isidro is against OceanaGold. There are people here who would like to see the jobs that come with a working mine.\n\n\"Let them come here,\" said Gilberto Vasquez Ramos, a city council member. The mining might cause some damage, he admitted. If that happens, however, the company can make up for it by paying a fine.\n\nLuis A. Parada is a lawyer for El Salvador's government. He feels it is particularly wrong for El Salvador's wishes to be ignored.\n\nThe big question, Parada said, is whether a foreign company should have to follow the current laws of the country in which it is operating. Or, should a company have to change its laws to satisfy a foreign company?\n\nIf OceanaGold wins, he added, it would set a very bad example. It would encourage other companies to try to force foreign countries to give them what they want.'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE -  Government officials said Friday that some wind power companies will be allowed to kill, by accident, bald and golden eagles for up to 30 years. And they won't get in trouble for it.\n\nThe White House wants to produce more energy from earth-friendly sources. Wind and solar power are two such sources. They're called green energy.\n\nThe idea is to get away from using so much oil and coal for power. Those types of energy are bad for nature.\n\nBut, wind energy can hurt wildlife like bald and golden eagles. The problem is that eagles die by accident when they fly into the wind farms. The farms have turbines which spin around. The birds get caught in them.\n\n## Permits Extended To 30 Years\n\nNature groups slammed the White House's new rules. They said it was a bad move for wildlife.\n\n\"It's outrageous that the government is sanctioning the killing of America's symbol, the bald eagle,\" David Yarnold said. He is president of the National Audubon Society, a conservation organization that focuses on birds.\n\nPeter Kelley is a spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association. He disagrees. He said that for a wind farm to get a permit under the new rules, it must list all of the different ways it will preserve the eagles. The farms will be checked on every five years.\n\nHe said, \"Even then, if more eagles are dying than you expected, you have to do more things or lose your permit.\"\n\nThe government began handing out permits to wind farms in 2009. The permits allowed for the accidental killing of bald and golden eagles, which are protected by the government.\n\nThe old permits lasted five years at most. Wind businesses said that was not enough. They argued that the permits needed to be longer. Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth spending money to build wind power farms.\n\nThe new rules would extend the permits. But, to no more than 30 years. And, they will be granted only to companies that run their business \"to ensure the preservation of eagles,\" the government said.\n\n## Stopping Climate Change\n\nKelley said the new rules would \"increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms.\" He said wind farms are important. They can help stop climate change.\n\nClimate change is a shift in weather patterns. It's thought to be caused in part by humans burning fuels. That leads to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).\n\nHe says that climate change is \"the No. 1 threat to all eagles and all wildlife.\" Not wind farms.\n\nUnder the new rules, permits will be looked at every five years. And the number of eagle deaths will be counted. Population levels of the birds will also be checked. Government officials could make companies put new plans into place to save more eagles.\n\nAnd they could take away their permits.\n\nBut the American Bird Conservancy says that the new rules are voluntary. Wind farms don't have to pay attention to them. And it said that the government was relying on the companies to tell it if they've killed the eagles.\n\n## Birds And Bats At Risk\n\nKelley, of the American Wind Energy Association, said that wind farms hadn't had a big effect on bald eagles. He said that only a tiny amount of the golden eagles killed by humans died because of wind farms. The population of golden eagles in the western U.S. is stable, he said. It may even be going up.\n\nMichael Hutchins is an expert on wind power at the bird conservancy. He pointed to a new study that found that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms.\n\nAnd that could get worse, Hutchins said. The White House wants 12 times more energy to come from wind and solar energy, from the sun, by 2030.\n\nHe asked, \"If it's not done right, what kind of an impact is that going to have on birds and bats?\"\n\nRoughly 50 years ago, the greatest danger to eagles was chemicals used on crops. They caused the birds to become endangered, Hutchins said. New dangers include construction around areas where eagles nest and, now, wind power.\n\nHe supports wind power. \"But it ought to be done right,\" Hutchins said. \"You can't call it green if it's killing hundreds of thousands of birds and bats annually and if it's killing large numbers of protected eagles.\"'"

            "text": "\tMIAMI - A tegu can't gobble down a deer or alligator like an 18-foot Burmese python can.\n\nBut the four-foot lizard can do a lot more damage to South Florida's wildlife. And now, scientists say, it's too late to wipe the tegu out.\n\n\"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud,\" said Tony Pernas. He works for the National Parks Service. He also co-chairs the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area group.\n\nNow, all they can hope for is to limit the tegus' spread.\n\n## Containment Is Urgent, Experts Say\n\nThe tegus found in the wild most likely were abandoned by their owners. Although wild reptiles, the lizards have become popular pets. They also may have escaped from breeding centers in south Miami-Dade County.\n\nWildlife experts are trying to round up as many tegus as possible before October, when the lizards go into hibernation. After that, it will be difficult to find them.\n\nAnd they're especially worried that the black-and-white tegus will spread to nearby Everglades National Park. A handful of them already have been caught there. The lizards eat just about anything. Their menu includes small animals, birds, insects, plants, and their all-time favorite - eggs. And that means goodbye to the baby American crocodiles that hatch in the refuge and other [endangered animals](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) like the wood rat.\n\nIt's hard to keep them from spreading, said Jenny Eckles. She is a wildlife biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Tegus thrive in temperatures as low as 35 degrees and enjoy South Florida's steamy heat, she said. Burmese pythons can't handle the cold, and their numbers were reduced during a cold snap in 2010 which made them less of a problem for the local wildlife.\n\nThe lizards hibernate from October until about January or February. They then emerge once again to search for food and lay their eggs. Females can lay 35 eggs a year.\n\n## Tegus Growing In Number\n\nEckles and other scientists don't know the exact size of the tegu population. But the numbers definitely are on the rise. Pernas said trappers caught 13 tegus in 2009. This summer, researchers captured more than 140 of them. These were found mainly on public lands, according to Eckles. Citizen trappers have taken more than 300 from private lands.\n\nTegus are easiest to trap using eggs as bait, according to Jake Edwards. He is a wildlife expert hired by the FWC to capture the lizards. Edwards said they are not easy to catch. He may have 10 seconds to catch one before it runs away.\n\nBut neither Edwards nor Jeff Fobb recommends grabbing a tegu by hand. Fobb is a trapper who also heads Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's Venom One unit. The tegu has needle-sharp teeth and claws.\n\n\"I'd rather get bit by a 10-foot snake than that guy right there,\" Fobb said. He pointed to a two-footer he recently caught in someone's garage.\n\nSouth Florida's growing tegu population has spawned a new industry: trappers who sell them as pets.\n\nRodney Irwin, of Homestead, began trapping tegus for fun and profit about two years ago. He estimates he's taken between 800 and 1,000 tegus. He sells most of them directly to customers on his website www.tegusonly.com. They sell for about $100 each.\n\n## Their Days As Pets Not Numbered\n\n\"This is a chance for me to make a difference,\" he said. \"I can't do anything about the apes in Borneo, but I can do something about the natives in my hometown.\"\n\nIrwin was asked whether he was concerned that the tegus may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned by their owners. Irwin responded that none of his customers are local. In any case, they could buy a tegu in a pet store. He said he shares his information about the captured lizards with scientists.\n\nSo far, there are no plans to stop letting people keep tegus as pets, according to Kristen Sommers. She works for the FWC.\n\nSommers said the FWC is trying to determine whether the tegus might expand farther. It also wants to understand what would happen if they do. Within the next year, the FWC will have enough information to decide its next steps.\n\n\"We need to figure out what's going on with this,\" Sommers said.'"

            "title": "Scientists learn animals used to be a lot smaller than they are today",
            "text": "\tScientists say they have proved an important idea in evolution.\n\nThe idea is called Cope's Rule. It says that animals often start out small and get bigger over millions of years. Evolution is an idea, or theory, about the way that types of life have developed over the years.\n\nThe scientists are Jonathan Payne and Noah Heim of Stanford University.\n\nPayne and Heim studied records about fossils, the remains of things that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. A fossil can be an ancient bone, or a shell, or even an image of a tiny animal preserved in a rock. Scientists call these the fossil record.\n\n## \"Things Are Getting Bigger\"\n\nOver the past 542 million years, sea (marine) animals have gotten 150 times larger, Payne and Heim said. They reported their work in the magazine Science.\n\nThe scallop on your dinner plate is an example. It may be fat now. However, scallops from millions of years ago were about one-quarter inch long.\n\nScientists have argued about Cope's Rule for years. Heim said the information in the fossil record proves it.\n\n\"We found that things are getting bigger. And bigger,\" he said.\n\nAn example of Cope's Rule is the horse. Horses started out the size of a house pet, basically dog-size. Now they are so big that people ride them, and they can pull wagons.\n\n## Testing Cope's Rule\n\nSome scientists started doubting Cope's Rule in the 1970s. Famous Harvard University scientist Stephen Jay Gould dismissed it. Gould said that Cope's Rule was not a law of nature. To be a law of nature it would need to be unchanging.\n\nThe Stanford team took a tough look at Cope's Rule.\n\nThey measured more than 17,000 groups of marine fossils. Dozens of high school students and Stanford students helped.\n\nStudents carefully measured pictures of fossils. Then the measurements were analyzed using computers.\n\nThey found that Cope was correct. They also found out that evolution can be predicted, which was even more important.\n\n## Getting Bigger All The Time\n\nTake the sea urchin, for instance. Two million years ago, the typical sea urchin was about two inches long, and now it can be nearly a foot long, said Heim.\n\nAnimals didn't get steadily larger over time. Instead, bigger animals usually push out smaller ones and take over and breed together, the scientists found.\n\nAlso, size didn't increase slowly. It happened in significant leaps. The urchin's first big increase in size came between about 500 million years ago and 250 million years ago, when plants, amphibians and reptiles first showed up. Then urchins didn't grow in size from 250 to 65 million years ago. But then they took another jump in size around 60 million years ago.\n\nThe growth spurts may happen when large numbers of species die out. These \"mass extinctions\" make room for new creatures, Heim said.\n\n## The Big Deal\n\nThe scientists didn't study why being big is so helpful. Maybe it's harder for anything else to eat them or perhaps mates find them more attractive. Or they could be better at fighting off competitors.\n\nWill we someday live on a planet of giants?\n\nNo, size eventually becomes a problem, Heim said. Breathing becomes difficult because lungs need to be huge and work very well to keep supplying the air needed to support such large bodies. Food is a challenge, too. There just isn't enough of it.\n\nThere is one final twist: Humans overrule Cope's Rule. Hunters and fishers target large animals, which means smaller animals have a better chance to survive, said Heim.\n\nSo just when Cope's Rule is finally proven, people might be doing things to change it, Heim said.'"

            "title": "Adding good taste (and healthier ingredients) to U.S. Army food\u00a0",
            "text": "\tRALEIGH, N.C. - A ready-to-eat Army meal can survive a 1,200-foot parachute drop and stay fresh for up to three years. But if it doesn't taste good to a soldier, it's going straight to the trash.\n\nThat's a problem researchers at North Carolina State University want to solve. Their solution is to pull out the nutrients from tasty fruits and vegetables and put them into foods like snack bars.\n\n\"Soldiers throw out anything that doesn't look and taste good,\" said Mary Ann Lila, the lead researcher. \"If it's nutty and good tasting, the guys will eat it - especially if they know it has high protein and will help with energy and muscle mass. Here, we are making an ingredient that not only will taste good but will be good for your body and your health.\"\n\nLila and her researchers received $60,000 from food companies to help with their project. They money will allow them to test their new way of pulling out and transplanting vital nutrients. They got to chose one fruit and one vegetable for testing.\n\n\"Because of our North Carolina connection, we decided on kale greens and muscadine grapes,\" she said.\n\n## Delicious, And Nutritious Too\n\nThese and other vegetables and fruits have phytochemicals. Antioxidants are another word for phytochemicals. The body needs phytochemicals for many things.  They help ward off illness and they can repair cell damage. Brain functions improve with the help of phytochemicals.\n\nFeeding an army is not easy. The military has its own food research and development laboratory in Natick, Massachusetts. It's called the Combat Feeding Directorate.\n\nDelivering fresh fruits and vegetables to troops is difficult. Sometimes it is downright impossible, especially in parts of the world where they are not grown, said Tom Yang, a food technologist for the Combat Feeding Directorate.\n\nGetting any food to the right place is hard enough, but fruits and vegetables spoil fast, Yang said. \"Many times there is no refrigeration. We have to use food that is shelf-stable.\" The Army considers food to be shelf-stable if it can stay fresh for 3.5 years when stored at 80 degrees, or nine months at 100 degrees.\n\nAnd the food must be something soldiers are willing to eat.\n\n\"It has to taste good and look good to soldiers who are 20 or 21 years old,\" Yang said. \"They can be pretty picky. They'd really rather be eating fried chicken or pizza or hamburgers.\"\n\n## Eating Healthier Snack Bars\n\nSoldiers in harsh climates such as Iraq or Africa have few options. They tend to survive on snack bars full of protein and carbohydrates.  The bars don't have a lot of nutrients. They lack the cancer-fighting glucosinates found in kale or the heart-healthy flavonoids in grapes.\n\nThe researchers have found a way to make similar products in a healthier way. First, they take out the phytochemicals from fruit and vegetables. Then they add the phytochemicals to flour made from soybean or hemp. The flour can be used to make snack bars for the soldiers. Their process also filters out some sugars, fats and waters from the fruits and vegetables. It makes a concentrate. One tablespoon of the concentrate is equal to four or more servings of fruits and vegetables. The concentrate is safe to eat for several months, Lila said.\n\nLila's team hired a company to run a taste test. \"They really loved it,\" Lila said. \"It has a pleasant fruity aroma and texture.\"\n\nYang said he is eager to run his own tests on samples from the project. He wants to figure out how the products will work as part of the Army's ready-to-eat meal program. \"The work sounds impressive so far,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at the institute are experimenting with different foods that could be made with the healthier flour. They test the new products for shelf-life, nutrition and taste.\n\n## Civilians, Too, Can Benefit\n\nSoldiers aren't the only ones who could use more phytochemicals, Lila said. Athletes, hikers and people watching their weight could also be helped.\n\nIn a 17-day experiment, some students drank a beverage containing  phytochemicals from blueberries and green tea. Others got a drink with no phytochemicals. During the final three days of the experiment, they all did a 2.5 hour-long workout each day.\n\nThe students who had no phytochemicals stopped burning fat shortly after exercising, Lila said. \"But those given the phytochemicals were still burning fat in their sleep.\"'"

            "text": "\tDHAKA, Bangladesh - Mukhta Mollah smooths the red material and pushes it through a sewing machine. She is in Bangladesh, an Asian country next to India, making women's shirts that will be sent to America. She works six days a week in this hot and sweaty factory. Each workday is eight hours or more.\n\nToday, like every day, she will try to make 1,000 shirts.\n\nMore than 350 seamstresses, women sewing clothes, sit in rows in this huge factory. Bright lights buzz and blink overhead. Huge loud fans push around the hot air, which smells like new clothes.\n\nIt takes Mollah less than 30 seconds to complete her part of the shirt. A helper piles the shirts into a bin to take to the next station. Mollah has gotten used to the hard factory work.\n\n## Harsh Working Conditions\n\nMollah knows that she won't get rich; she sends nearly half of her $20-a-week paycheck home to her family. But she's grateful that her small salary has allowed her to escape her home village. Her schoolgirl friends are still stuck there.\n\nAll of them were married before age 16. All have children of their own. All have moved in with their husbands' families and must get permission from their mothers-in-law to leave the house.\n\n\"For them, it's a cage,\" said Mollah, 19. \"My life is much better than theirs because they have no freedom. When I go back to my village and see my friends, they ask me, 'Can you take us with you?'\"\n\nBangladesh's clothing factories have been known to treat their workers badly. The factories can even be deadly. An eight-story factory collapsed last April, crushing more than 1,100 workers. Six months earlier, a factory fire killed 112 people who could not escape because their bosses had locked the doors to keep them working.\n\nWorkers in Bangladesh face terrible conditions - often working 80 hours a week and fearing terrible accidents. But the work is still a good opportunity for women in this poor, traditional Muslim society. There is not much else for them to do.\n\nAbout 5,600 factories in Bangladesh have more than 4 million workers; almost all of them are female.\n\n## Proud Of Their Apartment\n\nThe factory jobs allow teenage girls to become adults with some independence, said Sajeda Amin, a New York sociologist who studies the clothing factories. Still, she added, it's not as good as getting a college education.\n\nRecently, workers have protested in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In response, the factories paid their workers more. Now, they must pay workers $68 a month, or 33 cents an hour. But the clothing workers still need more rights, their supporters say.\n\nIt's lunchtime, and Mollah leaves the factory with most of the other 350 workers for the hourlong break. She meets up with the three other young women she lives with.\n\nTheir two-bedroom apartment is two blocks away. The four women all live in one small room. Two sleep on a double bed, and two sleep on a pad on the concrete floor. Every other week they switch sleeping places. They all split the rent, which is $45 a month.\n\nThe apartment is tiny and very simple, but Mollah and her roommates are proud of it. Even though road dust always blows in through the windows, they work hard to keep the apartment clean.\n\n## \"I Make My Own Decisions\"\n\nKanchi Hazi, the most outgoing roommate, said the apartment is luxurious compared to her home village. There, she shared a small house with her parents, six sisters and two brothers.\n\nThe 24-year-old left her home village seven years ago to take this factory job. She sews pockets on blouses and works as many hours as she can get.\n\n\"I like it here.\" she said. \"I make my own decisions. I can earn money and help my family.\"\n\nBy working extra hours, she can make $78 a month. She sends half of it home to help her poor family.\n\nEvery few months, she rides the bus for three hours to visit her family. Some villagers support her decision to work. They say she is making good money and helping her family. Others scold her, saying that it is not proper for a young single woman to work alongside men.\n\nBut when she steps off the bus, younger village girls dance around her. \"They see me as a role model,\" Hazi said. \"I can do whatever I want. I can enjoy myself. I have freedom.\"'"

            "text": "\tBALTIMORE - In Easton, Maryland, a new history about African-Americans is being dug right out of the ground. Before the Civil War, most African-Americans were held as the property of white people.\n\nBut experts here are examining evidence of a free black community during the early years of the American republic.\n\nArchaeologists and historians are uncovering the story of an area called The Hill. They are digging up glass, pottery and other objects to give them clues about the past. They believe The Hill is the earliest settlement of free African-Americans in the United States, dating to 1790.\n\nDale Green is a professor at Morgan State University. He said that this project is not just a story about black people. It's a story about America.\n\n## Digging Back In Time\n\nThe Hill was founded by freed slaves. Some slaves were able to buy their freedom, while others were freed by some religious groups. In communities like The Hill, they had the freedom to own property and trade goods.\n\nAccording to the 1790 census, a population count, about 410 free African-Americans lived on The Hill. This is much more than the 250 free African-Americans who lived in the port city of Baltimore at the time.\n\nResearchers and students are in the middle of a three-week dig. They are working in 5-by-5-foot squares. The deeper they dig, the further back in history they go.\n\nIn the first few inches of soil, the team found 20th-century objects such as toys, marbles and pipe stems. A little deeper, they discovered evidence of 19th-century life.\n\nStefan Woehlke is in charge of the dig. He showed off part of an olive-green glass bottle that was decorated with a cluster of grapes. Woehlke said the bottle was probably used to hold wine. He believes it was made in the late 18th or early 19th century. The diggers also found a 1-cent coin featuring Lady Liberty, dated 1794.\n\nProfessor Green said that the free African-Americans lived alongside white families at The Hill. In 1790, this property belonged to James Price, a white man. Records show that Price and three free African-Americans lived on the property. The records don't include very much information about the African-Americans.\n\n## Putting The Pieces Together\n\nThe work at The Hill promises to give up lots of new information. But the researchers say they're only scratching the surface.\n\n\"It's sort of piecing together a puzzle, but you don't have all the pieces,\" Woehlke said. The group will spend at least five more years working at Easton.\n\nSince the dig began, more than 500 people have visited the site. Some visitors have been on organized tours. But others have just wandered in after seeing signs posted around the block.\n\nPriscilla Morris has family roots in Easton that date back to the 1600s. She is a regular visitor to the area. She said she finds the dig \"thrilling\" because no one knows how people lived here two hundred years ago.\n\nProfessor Green said the work at The Hill could change the way American history is told. At the moment, the story of free blacks is usually ignored. In the past, history was always told by the slave owners rather than the African-Americans.\n\nThere are big plans to get the word out about The Hill. These include work by students and new museums. There might even be a movie made about the African-American community at Easton.\n\nThe Hill already is part of the National Register of Historic Places. That information will soon be updated to include the black history of the area.\n\n## An Untold Story\n\nAbout 75 researchers and students are working on The Hill project. Tracy Jenkins is a graduate student in archaeology at the University of Maryland. He said that the local community has been very interested in the dig and friendly to the archaeologists.\n\nJenkins said this is encouraging and unusual as it doesn't often happen in archaeology. He said that he sometimes has to dig in lonely places in the countryside where there is no one else around.\n\nAt The Hill, which is in the middle of town, the researchers and local people are getting to know each other. Jenkins is excited about working on the project. He's glad to have the chance to write what he called a paper that really matters, and not something that just \"sits on a shelf.\"\n\nHe added, \"I like the opportunity to tell stories that haven't been told.\"'"

He still does not have a full-time job.\n\nIn fact, he said, he has rarely been called back for an interview.\n\n\"I had this vision of helping my mom out, since she struggled to raise five of us. I wanted to give her some relief,\" Winfield said. He is the first in his family to attend college.\n\n## The Search Is Difficult\n\nEmployment is higher than it has been in years. However, recent college graduates across the country are struggling to find work. For young black men and women with college degrees, the job search has been especially tough. According to a new study, they are having a harder time than whites finding a job. They are more likely to work in a job where their college degree is not needed. Also, they are being paid less than white workers with the same experience.\n\nEven blacks who have studied science, technology, engineering and math had a hard time finding work, said John Schmitt. He co-authored the new report, \"A College Degree is No Guarantee.\"\n\n\"We are looking at a group of people who did everything right,\" Schmitt said. \"They graduated high school like they were told. They went to college and graduated. They entered the labor market, but they are more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts.\"\n\n## Just One Opportunity\n\nLike Winfield, many of these graduates were the first in their family to attend college. They may face pressure from family and friends who expect them to be successful and help support the family. All of this has made their search for work very urgent.\n\nThere are many reasons for the gap between whites and blacks. Black college graduates may not know people who can help them get interviews and jobs. More important, according to Schmitt, they can face discrimination.\n\nEmployers are more likely to offer a job to a white person than a black person, Schmitt said. Black graduates were more than twice as likely to be jobless as whites.\n\n\"You have someone who went to the right school, worked really hard and was told they can be anything they want,\" said Robert Hawkins. He studies poverty at New York University's Silver School of Social Work. \"Then they realize that isn't true.\"\n\nAnita Jenke, with the Career Transitions Center of Chicago, said that some of the black gradates come from poor communities. They do not have the money to get to interviews. Sometimes they lack a working cellphone or Internet connection.\n\n\"These kids have so much to give,\" Jenke said. \"They are so motivated, so personable and committed to making it. They are accomplished and often they want to work helping to contribute to society. They just need an opportunity.\"\n\n## He Is Still A Success\n\nAt Colby-Sawyer College, Winfield was a top student who created the school's first gospel choir.\n\n\"Jeramey is just a wonderful person who made our campus a better place,\" said the college's president, Tom Galligan.\n\nWinfield's success in college is part of the reason he cannot understand why he is having trouble finding a job.\n\n\"I feel like I'm a sharp and confident person,\" he said. \"I've always gone above and beyond. It does make me think, 'Am I not good enough? What's wrong with me?'\"\n\nNow, Winfield scrapes by earning money from working with kids at his former high school and working as a substitute teacher. The rest of the time, he volunteers as a youth leader at his church and searches for work.\n\n\"Being rejected by the professional world has pushed me to go harder working at my high school and my church,\" he said. Although he cannot find a job in his field, \"I know I can come back to where I came from and use it here. I'm still a success to the people here.\"'"

            "text": "\tCharde Nabors would prefer to spend Thanksgiving in her mother's kitchen. But the Sears department store cashier may spend the day working instead.\n\nSears is among the many retailers that will be open on Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\"We really don't want to work that, but who would say no when you need the money?\" said Nabors, 22, of Chicago. Nabors is a single mother with an infant and a 3-year-old. She works part time for $9 per hour.\n\nShe may be chosen to work that day even if she does not volunteer.\n\nThanksgiving \"brings you and your family together,\" Nabors said. \"And this is just taking it away.\"\n\n## Getting To The Customer's Wallet Early\n\nThe holiday shopping season has been moving up earlier. It used to start the day after Thanksgiving. The day became known as Black Friday. Now Black Friday may be dead and the family Thanksgiving dinner may be, too.\n\nKmart might be the best example. It has long been open for some hours on Thanksgiving. This year, it will be open for 41 hours straight. It will open its doors at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving. Macy's will break a 155-year-old tradition of closing on Thanksgiving. It will open at 8 p.m. Thursday.\n\nSo will Sears, which will then stay open through the night until 10 p.m. Friday. Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and many others will also have Thanksgiving hours this year.\n\n\"Thanksgiving used to be the one day retailers took a breather,\" said Bill Martin. He is the founder of  ShopperTrak. His company helps retailers. \"We find it an unusual tactic for the retailers. They're trying to get to the consumer's wallet as early as possible.\"\n\nRetailers have been racing to start the holiday season earlier. Now Black Friday has become Black Thursday.\n\nWhy? There could be many reasons. This year there are not as many days between Thanksgiving and Christmas as there were last year. Hannukkah also comes very early. Retailers may be scared of losing sales to a competitor. Shoppers also can just shop on an iPad at home whenever they want.\n\n\"The culture shock of, 'Oh, my goodness, they're opening on Thanksgiving!' is starting to wear off,\" said Marshal Cohen. He is chief industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group.\n\n## Adventure Shoppers On The Hunt\n\nSeveral retailers claim they are simply giving their customers what they want. But experts say that just is not true.\n\nMartin calls the trend a \"sad event.\"\n\nHe said, \"We don't think it's the consumer saying, 'Open up earlier, open up more.'\" Martin said. Instead, retailers want to get shoppers in the store \"to get to the money before it's all spent.\"\n\nBut a small segment of deal-seeking consumers will be glad for the extended Black Friday, Darrin Duber-Smith said. He calls them adventure shoppers. Those shoppers are \"stimulated by the hunt.\" Duber-Smith is a marketing professor. He teaches at Metropolitan State University of Denver\n\nLast year, 23 percent of holiday shoppers said they would shop on Thanksgiving Day. That was up from 17 percent in 2011, according to a survey by Deloitte.\n\nA different poll found nearly 1 in 7 shoppers admitted to skipping Thanksgiving dinner, rushing through it or starting early to participate in Black Friday sales that began later that day. Some chose not to travel to a relative's house in favor of shopping. The poll was released by PromotionalCodes.com and conducted online by Harris Interactive.\n\n## Shopping, Then Food, Family And Football\n\nDavid Gladney said he prefers early Thanksgiving Day store openings. That way he can get his deal hunting out of the way in the beginning of the day and get back to food, family and football.\n\n\"I would come out - just because it's that early,\" he said.\n\nIt does not seem as bad anymore to be doing something besides being with the family on Thanksgiving. Shopping is only the latest alternative activity, said Randy Allen. He is a management professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.\n\nOther events such as Turkey Trot running races and deer hunting on Thanksgiving morning pull people away from family, Allen said. And, of course, sports fans are often watching football games. So what's the harm in non-sports fans participating in the most American of all sports, competitive shopping?\n\n\"It's not like the whole family is necessarily together the whole day, anyway,\" Allen said.'"

            "text": "\tRyo Hirosawa, who is blind, tried to figure out what was in front of him. Was it a house, a car, a hedge, a fence, a tree or open space?\n\nHirosawa pushed the tip of his tongue to the top of his mouth, and made a sharp click.\n\nAs its echo came back, he could not quite decide what it sounded like. Did it sound scattered, as if it hit leaves? Was it a pulse bouncing off a solid wall? Was it hitting many different objects?\n\nHirosawa kept clicking, and the landscape began to emerge as a picture in his mind.\n\n\"There is a tree, I think, here, which is tall, and I see a house behind,\" Hirosawa said.\n\n## Telling A Tree From A House\n\nHirosawa stepped into the yard to find out whether he was right. Brian Bushway, his teacher, tapped his cane against a tree trunk, and reached up to grab a branch and shake the leaves.\n\nBushway then knocked against a wooden wall.\n\n\"A house,\" Bushway said. \"Awesome, very good.\"\n\nThis quiet street in Long Beach, California, is the home of World Access for the Blind. The group teaches blind people to find their way using tongue clicks.\n\n## Sending Out Sound Like Bats, Dolphins\n\nTheir students learn to send out sonar, as dolphins or bats do, to know where they are. Clicking is a human form of echolocation. Sonar is a way of finding objects by sound. The creatures make a noise, and then use its sonar to listen to the echo to figure out where an object is.\n\nDaniel Kish, who is blind and began the group, has worked with scientists to study how the brain does this. Scientists found that when people use sonar, they use the part of the brain that has to do with seeing. They do not use the part people usually use with hearing.\n\nWhen Kish was small, he began made clicking noises with his tongue to navigate. Many blind children often do this. Unlike other parents, who worried that their child might sound weird, his mother and father did not discourage him from clicking.\n\nHe rode bikes and climbed trees but did not understand how the clicking was helping him until he was 11. A friend pointed out that he was doing what bats do.\n\n\"I hadn't thought about it,\" Kish said. \"I was just a squirrelly kid who liked to be active.\"\n\n## Brain Uses Sound To Build Image\n\nBushway, who is also blind, could see columns in his school hallway, and even count them.\n\nWhen he met Kish, he told him about this. Kish told him that his brain was forming an image from the sound reflecting off the columns.\n\n\"The brain creates images whether you send it patterns of light or patterns of sound,\" he said.\n\nKish showed Bushway how to skateboard. With the help of another teacher, who could see, they started mountain-biking on trails and roads in the mountains.\n\nIn 2001, Kish started the group to teach the clicking method. Since then his team has traveled to more than 34 countries.\n\n## Concern That Clicking Sets Them Apart\n\nSome blind people worry that the clicking would seem strange to people.\n\nThe National Federation of the Blind said all blind people use echolocation to an extent. \"Mr. Kish has a unique way of doing it that seems to work for him and others,\" said Chris Danielson, a spokesman for the group.\n\nHe said many blind people tap their canes for the same reason.\n\nBrandon Shin, 17, came to Kish for help two years ago after slowly losing his sight.\n\n## A Cane, Some Clicks, And Navigating A Canyon\n\nNow he clicks all the time and recently hiked a canyon by himself. \"Just the cane and my clicking,\" Shin said.\n\nHe says some kids at school made fun of him, but others have been really interested.\n\nShin's father said he watched his son get around obstacles as though he could see them.\n\n\"Sonar has given Brandon self-esteem and courage,\" Michael Shin said. \"From a parent's point of view, we're worried he'll get hurt, but we're proud. He's doing it better than we expected.\"'"

            "text": "\tNo one likes being bored. But maybe boredom itself isn't that boring. It turns out there's a lot more to it than scientists thought.\n\nA new study of students in Germany reveals that there are five different types of boredom. That's one more than researchers had expected.\n\nThe newly discovered type is called \"apathetic boredom.\" Apparently, it's quite common among high school students.\n\nAnd boredom isn't just boring. It can be dangerous too - either for the person who is bored, or for the people around him or her. For instance, people who are bored are more likely to smoke, drink or use drugs. Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble with the police. Boredom can also lead to health problems.\n\n## From Daydreaming To Leaving\n\nBut boredom hadn't been studied very much before.\n\nThomas Goetz set out to correct that. Goetz is an education researcher. He and his team found two sets of test subjects: 63 college students and 80 high school students.\n\nThe researchers gave the students personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, which are a bit like smartphones. These beeped six times during the day. When the PDAs beeped, students were asked to complete a survey. This asked what they were doing and how they felt about it.\n\nGoetz's team didn't set out to find a new kind of boredom. Scientists then believed there were only four types of boredom.\n\nThe least serious form is a relaxing and slightly pleasant type of boredom that leads to daydreaming.\n\nNext is a slightly unpleasant state of having wandering thoughts. At this level of boredom, people start to think about changing their situation.\n\nMore serious is what researchers call \"searching boredom.\" It's a type of boredom that makes people feel restless. It leads them to actively try to do something to limit feelings of boredom.\n\nThe worst type is called reactant boredom. This is so bad it makes sufferers leave situations they find boring. It also makes them avoid those responsible for the situation, such as teachers.\n\n## The Boring Life Of A Student\n\nThe short PDA surveys first asked student volunteers what they were doing. Were they in the middle of a serious activity such as attending a class or studying for a test? Or were they doing something easier, like eating or napping?\n\nStudents were then asked how they felt about what they were doing. If they felt bored, they were asked to rate their feelings of boredom. They could be feeling anything from \"calm\" to \"fidgety.\"\n\nWhat researchers found is that the life of a student can be very boring indeed.\n\nDuring the two-week period of the study, the college students were bored more than a quarter of the time. Life was even more dull for the high school students. They were bored almost 40 percent of the time.\n\nCollege students reported that slightly more than half of their boring experiences occurred during a serious activity. For high school students, this number was higher: two-thirds of their boring experiences occurred while they were in class or studying. Unlike college students, high schoolers can't easily walk away from a boring situation.\n\n## A Big Boring Surprise\n\nThe big surprise for researchers was finding a fifth type of boredom: apathetic boredom. One-tenth of all boredom reported by the college students was apathetic boredom. Among high-schoolers, more than a third of all boredom was apathetic boredom.\n\nThis was a troubling discovery. Students found apathetic boredom even more unpleasant than reactant boredom, but they were far less likely to do anything about it. Apathetic boredom, the researchers say, is related to two serious mental health problems: learned helplessness and depression. In other words, apathetic boredom can lead to or add to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.\n\n\"Apathetic boredom seems to be as bad as reactant boredom,\" Goetz explained. Reactant boredom can be dangerous for other people. Apathetic boredom, he said, might be dangerous for the people experiencing it.\n\nThe researchers hope to continue their studies of boredom. They plan to study younger students, as well as adults in the workplace. But Goetz said he didn't expect any more boring surprises.\n\n\"I don't think that there are more than the five types of boredom,\" he said.'"

            "title": "Thousands of children left out of Head Start due to budget cuts",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Last year about 1 million of the nation's poorest children were helped by Head Start. This 48-year-old federal program prepares children for school. It is open to those five and under.\n\nBut this fall about 57,000 children will be denied a place in Head Start and Early Head Start. The government will no longer pay for them.\n\nThe cuts in funding were automatic. They happened because of disagreements between lawmakers in Washington. Democrats and Republicans couldn't agree on how much money the government should spend, and about what they should spend it on.\n\nLast year, the federal program received $8 billion in funding. So far, cuts this year have slashed more than $400 million.\\n## Making Painful Cuts\n\nYasmina Vinci runs the National Head Start Association. According to her, this is the largest cut to Head Start funding since the program began in 1965.\n\n\"The cut has been very painful throughout the country,\" Vinci said. Nationwide, about 1,600 groups and agencies receive federal Head Start funding.\n\nAccording to the latest figures, slots for 51,000 preschoolers were eliminated. So too were child care slots for 6,000 babies. Children will lose 1.3 million days of service at Head Start centers. More than 18,000 employees will be laid off or see their pay reduced.\n\nHead Start provides preschool services to 3- to 5-year-olds from low-income households. It also offers their families education, health, nutrition and social services. Early Head Start helps the families of infants and pregnant women.\n\nSupporters of the program say it offers major long-term benefits. They claim these are reflected in better school grades, higher earnings and lower crime rates.\\n## Forced To Lower Enrollment\n\nHead Start directors have tried not to reduce the number of children they serve. But in many cases, they have had no choice. In Indiana, at least two Head Start programs used lotteries to decide which children had to stop attending.\n\n\"I think it's going to be devastating for families who were hoping ... for a year or two [of preschool] before their children got into kindergarten,\" said Cheryl Miller, who runs the Indiana Head Start Association. \"These are families that are struggling already. They're not going to be able to pay the cost of some other type of preschool program in their community.\"\n\nShe added, \"For all of us, as a nation, this should be heartbreaking.\"\n\nPeg Tazewell heads the Knox County Head Start in Ohio. She chose to increase class sizes rather than reduce the number of spots for children. At the same time, she had to cut six staff positions.\n\nTazewll was also forced to reduce transportation for students. Children used to be picked up and dropped off at home. Now parents will have to drive them up to six miles to a bus stop. Some of the children will have to ride the bus as far as 20 miles.\\n## Longer Rides To Bus Stops\n\nMost of the parents of the children at Tazewell's center have jobs that don't pay much. Often, their hours are not the usual nine to five. Tazewell worries some won't be able to drive their child to and from a bus stop every day. And if they can, they will have to spend more money on gas.\n\nIn Colorado earlier this year, Rachell Ruiz feared that her 2-year-old daughter would not be able to get into Head Start. The local program had announced that there would now be fewer spots.\n\nRuiz is a graduate of Head Start herself. She wanted her 2-year-old to be in the program because of the experience of her older daughter, who is now 4.\n\nRuiz's older daughter used to spend her days with her grandmother and rarely had the chance to play with other children. There are few children in their neighborhood, where people from other parts of town are afraid to go. \"They think they'll get shot in a drive-by,\" Ruiz said.\n\nNow, after a year in Head Start, her daughter is much more social. She has learned how to write her name and count to 20.\\n## \"It Hurts,\" Said One Mom\n\n\"Low-income people like me need that place,\" Ruiz said of Head Start. \"You don't have money to go pay for play dates. You don't have the money to go and pay for them to be in a gym or places like that.\"\n\nFortunately, Ruiz learned that both girls will have spots in the coming school year.\n\n\"The government doesn't realize what it's doing to ... lower-income [people],\" Ruiz said. \"They're taking away what we don't have. We barely have it and they're taking away. It hurts.\"'"

            "text": "\tPHNOM PENH, Cambodia - Sitting in a dirty bar down a back alley in the Cambodian capital, Ros Choun struggled to explain how he ended up here.\n\n\"They took my whole life, and there is nothing I can do about it,\" he said.\n\nDespite his Cambodian looks, Choun had spent almost his entire life in the United States. In fact, at 35, he doesn't think of himself as anything but American. His family sought safety in America in the early 1980s after fleeing their homeland. A civil war and mass killings left Cambodia in ruins and almost 2 million people dead.\n\n\"I was 6 months old when I left this country,\" he said. His voice was filled with anger. \"I'm American - but no one told us if we go to prison we could get deported back to Cambodia.\"\n\n## From A Trickle To A Flood\n\nSince 2002, hundreds of Cambodian-born men and women have been deported from the United States to Cambodia. Deportation means they are sent back to their country of origin, no matter how long ago they left. They lose the ability to come back to the U.S.\n\nThe deportees are the victims of a tough law and an agreement made after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. It allowed the deportation of any Cambodian found guilty of a serious crime who hadn't become a U.S. citizen.\n\nFew of those who arrived in the U.S. in the late 1970s and 1980s realized that being allowed to live in the U.S. was not the same as citizenship.\n\n\"I didn't know anything about any of this until 2011,\" said Aun Khoy, 51. He first came to the U.S. as a teenager. Khoy was sent back to Cambodia two years ago for a crime from over a decade ago.\n\nAt first there were just a trickle of deportations. Recently it has turned into a flood. The total number is now estimated at around 400.\n\n\"It's averaged about 10 deportees a month between 2009 and now,\" said Keo Sarith. He directs a Phnom Penh-based support center set up to help returnees.\n\n## On The Deportation List\n\nAnother 2,000 ethnic Cambodians in the U.S. are on the deportation list because of their criminal records. They could be picked up at any time.\n\n\"Many people are going about their ordinary lives. Working, studying, raising their families. But any knock on the door could be the immigration officers,\" said Bill Herod, an American pastor. Herod lives in Cambodia. He has been helping the returnees since the first groups arrived in 2002. \"It's a terrible injustice, but it's legal.\"\n\nChoun was picked up three years ago from his family's home in Atlanta. His crime? As a 16-year-old he had fired a gun at school to scare a group of bullies. He spent seven years behind bars. On release he thought he could put it all behind him.\n\n\"For a decade after I was released, I had no issues with the law. Ten years working, paying taxes and not even a traffic ticket,\" he said, shaking his head.\n\nChoun said there are other people whose situation is even worse. \"We have a 72-year-old grandfather here. He hit his son for joining a gang in 1986,\" he said. \"He was a teacher and now he drinks his life away. You can't get a job here if you are 70 years old.\"\n\n## Trying To Make A New Life\n\nMost of the deportees arrive in Cambodia with just the clothes on their backs. Many spend their first few weeks in one of the small rooms above the support center's office. After that, they must make a new life in a country where most people are poor.\n\n\"The Cambodian government has enough people to worry about and just isn't interested in them,\" says Keo.\n\nKen Touch arrived in Cambodia just over a year ago. It was the first time the 39-year-old had left the U.S. since coming from Cambodia as an infant.\n\nIn 2000, Touch was involved in a bar fight and shot someone in the thigh. After 10 years in prison and another year in an immigration detention center, he arrived in Cambodia.\n\n\"I knew after being released I would get deported. The whole time I was in prison I had that hanging over my head,\" he said.\n\n## Never To Come Back\n\nOne of the biggest difficulties for Touch is knowing that unless the law changes, he will never be allowed back into the U.S. Not even for big family events or funerals.\n\n\"Those who get sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. at least get to see their families, and if someone dies they take you to the funeral,\" he said. \"If my parents pass away, I won't even get to attend their funerals.\"'"

Cancer struck him before his first birthday and nearly killed him.\n\nThe Philadelphia preteen uses his experiences to make life easier for others like him.\n\nYoung patients at a local children's hospital liked little wagons better than wheelchairs, but the hospital did not have enough wagons. Peter helped raise money to buy more of them.\n\nOne of the side effects of his cancer treatment was loss of hearing.\n\nPeter saw that most books about childhood hearing loss \"are really bad,\" so he wrote his own.\n\nIn \"Peter Learns to Listen,\" he shares his own experience with hearing-loss.\n\nHe offers tips to children who don't hear well: \"Make sure to get the right (ear) molds, or they'll fall out when you hang upside down in a tree.\"\n\n## He's Become A Superhero Of Sorts\n\nPeter certainly understands the troubles of kids with cancer. He has made 13 trips to the operating room. In the end, cancer took most of his right leg.\n\nYet Peter came out a superhero of sorts.\n\nPeter has run a 5K race. He plays second base on his Little League team. He swims and dives. Peter dreams of someday pitching in the major leagues.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve 2003 when Dennis and Dawn Zucca learned their 10-month-old boy had cancer. The cancer was in his pelvis and had spread to his lungs.\n\nPeter went from crawling to dragging his body along the floor. He could not hold down food.\n\nTwo months later, the Zuccas were planning Peter's first birthday and his funeral.\n\n\"Enjoy him the best you can\" their doctors said, telling the Zuccas that Peter had only two months to live.\n\n## \"You're Cured\"\n\nAmazingly, several months later the tumor began to shrink and a doctor at a famous cancer hospital in New York was able to remove it. Peter was sent home with a 1 in 4 chance that he would live, his mother said.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2008, Peter's doctor called. \"I have the best gift - you're cured,\" he told Peter.\n\nIn addition to his hearing loss, Peter also had nerve damage in his hands and a foot. His right leg failed to grow well because of all the medicine and treatment. Then three years ago Peter's family decided to have it stretched longer. A sort of metal cage was attached to his leg.\n\n\"It had pins and wires in many places with a wire that went into my bones,\" Peter wrote in an essay that won a national contest. Peter was just learning to walk again when a lump was found in the leg. His mother said it was different from the first type of cancer.\n\nDennis and Dawn Zucca had a choice: Lose the leg, or risk losing the boy.\n\nDawn begged that the leg be cut off.\n\nIt was not easy. Peter writes: \"For a while after that, I was sad most of the time.\"\n\nThe hardest part still, Peter said, is \"not being able to play the same way.\"\n\n## He Does What He Can To Help Others\n\nHe has turned his powers to helping others. He started the Peter Powerhouse Foundation a year ago.\n\nThe foundation has raised about $65,000 to buy 100 wagons for the hospital and a pair of goggles that allow children to watch movies during treatment instead of being given medicine to sleep. Each pair costs $48,000, and Peter is hoping to raise enough for several more.\n\nPeter, who will head to middle school in the fall, still gets tested for cancer every year. So far, so good, his mother says.\n\nAs for his future, he dreams of going to Princeton University and learning computer programming. On a recent afternoon, though, all he could think about was getting started on a play date.\n\nPeter Powerhouse needed some fun: \"I was thinking we'd play basketball.\"'"

            "text": "b\"NEW YORK, N.Y. - A new government study shows that obesity is still rising among American adults. To be obese is to be so overweight that it becomes a health problem. The news comes even though the government has been trying for more than 10 years to get people to watch their weight.\n\nAlso, now a higher percentage of women than men are obese.\n\nFor the past several years, experts thought the nation's long rise in obesity had stopped. Then government health experts released a new report on Nov. 12. It said that nearly 4 in 10 adults were obese in 2013-14. About 10 years earlier, that figure was about 3 in 10.\n\n## Experts Don't Know Why\n\nThe study suggests that the situation is getting worse, said Dr. William Dietz. He is an obesity expert at George Washington University.\n\nAnother expert was not so sure. Barry Popkin of the University of North Carolina said the numbers could be off. The people selected for the study could be different from other people in the country, he said.\n\nExperts said they did not know why more people are becoming obese.\n\nThe report also found more women than men were obese. The percentage of obese men and women had been about the same for the last 10 years. However, the new report found that the percentage of women is now higher.\n\n## Weight Causes Health Trouble\n\nObesity is thought to be one of the nation's leading public health problems, and can lead to heart disease, diabetes and even death. Until the early 1980s, only about 1 in 6 adults were obese. The rate climbed until it hit about 1 in 3 around 10 years ago.\n\nThe new figures come from a regular government survey. The government studies about 5,000 people each year. In interviews, people tend to say their weight is lower than it really is. They also say they are taller than they actually are. The newest survey is different. People in this survey are actually weighed. Because of that, it is considered the best study for measuring obesity.\n\nThe government has been trying to fight obesity for years. It has been trying to get people to eat better and exercise. Also, people have been drinking less soda, which can have high amounts of sugar and calories. Fast-food restaurants have been offering healthier food.\n\nNew government rules have made companies remove trans fats from grocery store foods. Trans fats can raise a person's risk of heart disease. Other rules will make some restaurants list how many calories their foods have. Those rules have not started yet, though.\n\n## Gap Grows For Black Women And Men\n\nThe widening gap between men and women seems to be driven by what is happening among blacks and Hispanics, said Cynthia Ogden. She wrote the study report.\n\nThe percentages of obese men and women are still close. Yet there is a large gap between black men and women. More than half of all black women are now obese. Only about one-third of black men are obese. The difference is widening among Hispanics, too.\n\nThe report also looked at obesity in children. It did not see much change. For young people ages 2 to 19, the percentage of obesity has been holding steady over the past 10 years. About 2 in every 10 kids are obese.\n\nHealth officials have been especially worried about obesity in kids. First lady Michelle Obama started a program called Let's Move in 2010, to get kids to exercise more and help lower obesity.\n\nA government report last year noted one possible glimmer of hope. Obesity was falling among children ages 2 to 5.\n\nThe government measures obesity by calculating Body Mass Index. The index compares height and weight. For example, a man who is 5-foot-10-inch is overweight at 174 pounds. At 209 pounds he would be called obese.\n\n\""

For many children, it has ended their childhood.\n\nChildren have seen their parents killed and watched as boys and girls just like them were hurt. They have been forced to make decisions far beyond their years. Some decided to join the fighters who ruined their lives.\n\n## Children Left Behind\n\nChildren have been victims in virtually every conflict in this country, one of the poorest in the world. More than a year ago, a rebel group known as the Seleka seized power from the government. As many as 3,500 children were part of it. Other armed groups started fighting back and the number of child soldiers grew to 6,000.\n\nSome children, like Jordy, were handed guns, while other children were made slaves.\n\nToday, children barely in their teens still are with the fighters. Even by day, armed men threaten travelers on the road. Rifles and machetes are slung over their shoulders, and the fighters have protective charms draped around their necks.\n\nThe Seleka left behind nearly 400 children when they were pushed from power in January. Recently, the humanitarian organization UNICEF negotiated the release of more than 1,000 other children.\n\nOn a recent day, dozens of the children gathered on a shaded porch in Sibut. UNICEF made them available for interviews.\n\nSeveral of them smiled shyly at the visitors. But a few were angry, shouting that they needed help.\n\n## When The Rebels Came\n\nCharly recalled the day when the rebels arrived.\n\nHe was 15, and he was selling soap, sugar and other goods from a market stall in Sibut. His father was dead, and his mother couldn't support him.\n\nThe fighters streamed in on motorcycles and in pickup trucks. They fired their guns and set homes and businesses on fire.\n\n\"When they saw I was brave, and I could point out houses to rob, they accepted me,\" Charly said. He was given a Kalashnikov rifle and sent on patrols around his hometown, his fear replaced by arrogance.\n\n\"Everyone saw me carrying an AK,\" he said.\n\nThe thought of the return to his old life makes him sit rigid with anger, his eyes flashing.\n\n\"See the shoes I'm wearing?\" the teenager snapped, pointing at his dusty blue flip-flops full of holes.\n\nWith the rebels, he had power, he said. \"I had boots, a uniform and a gun in my hand.\n\nJordy, Charly and other youths marched with the rebels to the capital. Some were forced to go, but others were drawn by the idea of stealing.\n\n\"When I saw them starting to kill people, that's when I left,\" Charly said.\n\n## Forced To Be A \"Wife\"\n\nMireille was 14 when a rebel colonel spotted her last year and announced he wanted to marry her.\n\n\"I said, 'No, I'm still young,'\" recalled the slender girl with intricately braided hair. She sat hunched on a bench, wringing her hands in her lap.\n\nThat night, the rebel colonel showed up at her home. He took her to a Seleka base, forced her to marry him and gave her a new name, Kadija.\n\n\"I wanted to escape, but I couldn't because everyone had weapons,\" she said.\n\nAfter several months, the colonel lost interest in Mireille.\n\nReuniting the 78 girls freed by the Seleka with their families has been especially difficult.\n\nMany children don't even know where their relatives are - hundreds of thousands have fled their homes in the fighting. Humanitarian workers who are caring for some of the former fighters can spend months trying to locate their families.\n\nWhen families can be traced, they may be slow to take their sons back. Children who have been with the rebels have a hard time obeying their parents.\n\nMany children still march with the fighters, but those who have left struggle to find a way forward.\n\nMireille said she'd like to go back to school, and Jordy said he would like to try farming. Charly, though, has already been approached by militias eager to take advantage of his knowledge of the Seleka.\n\n\"With a gun,\" he said, \"you always have money.\"'"

            "text": "\tKANSAS CITY, Mo. - Seven chimps made a break for it at the Kansas City Zoo Thursday afternoon.\n\nBut it wasn't careless zookeepers who were responsible for the escape. Instead, it was clever chimpanzees.\n\nThat, at least, was zoo director Randy Wisthoff's explanation for the escape.\n\nUntil they were rounded up, the clever chimps caused a \"Code Red\" and an hourlong lockdown of zoo visitors.\n\n## An Afternoon Breakout\n\n\"Chimps are so smart,\" Wisthoff said.\n\nThe chimps escaped after one of them either found or broke off a 5- or 6-foot log or branch. The chimp leaned it against a wall, and climbed to the top. Then that chimpanzee - the \"ringleader,\" Wisthoff called him - persuaded six friends to join him up there.\n\nAt one point, three of the seven chimps went over the wall into an area only zoo workers can enter. Well before then, however, the zoo set in motion its emergency plans, which included gathering visitors into locked areas.\n\nAt no time were any of the zoo visitors in danger, Wisthoff said.\n\nThe breakout happened at about 3:30 p.m. It took about an hour for zookeepers to herd the animals, in groups of two or three, back into their area.\n\nThe chimps were lured with fruit and vegetables, including carrots, celery and lettuce.\n\n\"It was almost their dinnertime already,\" Wisthoff said.\n\n## Last One \"Bagged\"\n\nMost of the chimps went back quietly. One chimp, though, was unwilling to go back, so zookeepers brought out a bag of malted milk balls.\n\n\"That was the clincher,\" Wisthoff said.\n\nAll the workers know that chimps can be dangerous, Wisthoff said. Of the seven, the largest weighed about 150 pounds, and they are tremendously strong, he said.\n\nOn Friday, the 100-acre area normally occupied by 12 chimpanzees was closed. The area is equal to the size of 75 football fields. Zoo workers checked to make sure there were no more escape routes for the chimps to get out.\n\nThe workers are careful to check the area and remove large branches, Wisthoff said. That made him wonder whether the branch or log used Thursday had been broken off recently.\n\nAbout 1,800 people visited the zoo Thursday. Those who remained stayed put during the lockdown.\n\n## Time Well Spent\n\n\"We spent an hour in the birdcage,\" said the Rev. Celeste Ward of Emmanuel Repentance Temple of Kansas City. She was visiting the zoo with family members. Zoo workers politely explained the emergency, she said, and gave them several free zoo passes.\n\nZoo visitor Mari Cintron was visiting the penguin exhibit when the chimps escaped. She easily kept three children entertained during the hour they were locked in there.\n\n\"We just visited with the penguins,\" she said. \"It was very calm.\"\n\nSome visitors, like Cintron and Ward, spent the hour enjoying animals. But Brie Huffman, who lives in Missouri, for instance, was stuck with two friends and many others in a food storage area. She grew tired of the smell of animal food. But she appreciated the eight free zoo passes that were given to her.\n\nThe free passes are good until Dec. 31, and Huffman said she will be using all of them.'"

            "text": "\tJIANLI, China - A Chinese Yangtze River cruise ship overturned during a rainstorm Monday night.\n\nA total of 458 people were on board. At least 15 people were taken to safety during the rescue effort, including three pulled from the boat Tuesday. At least five people died in the accident, the Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nThe boat was carrying mostly elderly tourists from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing.\n\nDivers rescued a 65-year-old woman and, later, two men who had been trapped, Chinese television station CCTV reported. More people have been found alive and were being rescued.\n\nCCTV video showed rescuers in orange life vests climbing on the ship's hull. One of them lay down on the boat. The rescuer tapped the boat with a hammer, listened and then gestured downward into the boat where he thought he heard sounds.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter they're still alive or not,\" said Chen Shoumin. He is the military commander of Hubei province where the boat overturned.\n\nThe ship's captain and chief engineer both survived the accident. Police took them to be questioned.\n\n## Ship Suddenly In Trouble From Storm\n\nThe captain and engineer said the boat tipped over quickly after being caught in a cyclone, which is like a hurricane. A Chinese newspaper said the ship overturned within two minutes in the river, which was 50 feet deep in that area.\n\nZhang Hui, a tour guide, survived the disaster. He said the ship tilted and he grabbed a life jacket. Bottles fell off shelves, and suddenly, the boat turned all the way over.\n\nZhang said he cannot swim. He drifted in the river all night and reached the shore just before dawn.\n\n\"The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones,\" Zhang said.\n\nSome survivors swam ashore. Others were saved more than 12 hours after the accident.\n\nThirteen navy divers were helping with the rescue, and 170 more were joining them, Chen said. In total, more than 50 boats and 3,000 people helped with the search. Fast-moving water in the river made the rescue difficult.\n\nA 65-year-old woman was saved by divers. They brought extra breathing equipment into the boat and taught her how to use it.\n\nThat woman \"had a very strong will and learned very fast,\" Chen said.\n\nThe overturned ship drifted almost 2 miles before stopping close to shore.\n\n## Upside-Down Boat Might Still Have Air To Breathe\n\nThis was a good sign for rescuers. It meant there was enough air inside for the boat to float. It also meant there might be air inside for survivors to breathe, said Park Chi-mo. He is a professor at South Korea's Ulsan University.\n\nThe boat had been carrying 411 passengers and a crew of 47. Most of the passengers were 50 to 80 years old.\n\nIn Shanghai, relatives of the passengers were angry. They demanded to know whether the captain did enough to make sure the passengers were safe. Huang Yan wept as she said she thought that her husband and his elderly father were on board. She said she couldn't be sure of that because she hadn't seen a passenger list yet.\n\n\"Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?\" Huang shouted. \"We want the government to release the name list to see who was on the boat.\"\n\nThe Eastern Star was 251 feet long and 36 feet wide.\n\nThe Yangtze is the world's third-longest river and sometimes floods during the summer rainy season.\n\nCCTV reported that 6 inches of rain had fallen where the boat overturned in the past 24 hours. Winds in the area reached 80 miles an hour during the accident.'"

            "text": "\tSHANGHAI - Lonely Chinese parents can now take their children to court for not visiting them enough. A new law means older people can force their grown-up kids to come home more often.\n\nIn China, grandparents have always been treated with great respect. When people got older they could count on their relatives to include them in their households. Their children and grandchildren would care for them as they got frail.\n\nBut times are changing. As China becomes richer, younger people have more job opportunities. They often move to distant cities or other countries. And the elderly feel like they have been left behind.\n\nThe new law began on July 1 when the government noticed what was happening. The Chinese press wrote about the bad treatment of older people. It was even reported that one grandmother in her 90s was forced to live in a pigpen for two years.\n\n## Feeling Abandoned By Their Children\n\nOne 90-year-old woman called Yan Meiyue said her 72-year-old daughter doesn't visit often. Yan has been a widow since her husband died nearly 10 years ago. She now spends every weekday at a community center near her home. Yan plays the Chinese board game mahjong then eats meals made by volunteer staff.\n\n\"The volunteers keep us company,\" Yan said with a smile. She is one of many older people known as \"orphan grandparents\" who feel abandoned by their families.\n\nRobert Stowe England is an expert on aging in different countries. He said that charities, nursing homes and governments are now caring more and more for older people. This job used to be done by children and grandchildren.\n\nEngland explained that in the past, the sons of the family would be responsible for the care of elderly parents. Now all the sons are moving to the city. So there is no one left to look after them.\n\n## A Yearly Visit\n\nOne of Yan's neighbors is 82-year-old Ma Qiaoying. Ma said that both of her sons live outside of China and only visit her once a year. One son works for Germany's highway system, while the other works in Canada as an engineer.\n\nMa said that she looks to her other elderly friends for support. \"We're like a big family,\" she said. \"We can talk to each other and share our problems.\"\n\nJiang Gong Liang is a retired businessman. He used to live in Shandong province in the north of China. Then Jiang moved more than 500 miles to Shanghai, China's biggest city, to live closer to his daughter. He now spends a lot of time in Lu Xun Park. This city park is popular with retired people. Jiang passes his days by playing a violin-like instrument called a huqin for passers-by.\n\nJiang said he was happier now that he could see his daughter every day. But the elderly man did also admit that he misses his old home in the north where his family lived for generations.\n\nAbout 1.34 billion people live in China. Around 180 million of them are over the age of 60. The United Nations estimates that by 2050 one-quarter of China's people will be over 65 years old, or 333 million. That figure tops all the elderly of the United States, Canada, Japan and all of Europe put together.\n\nFor many years China's government had a strict one-child rule. Couples living in cities were not allowed to have multiple children. The law began in 1979 and it has been relaxed only in recent years.\n\n## A Traditional Belief\n\nRespect for older people is central to China's traditional beliefs. But the new law may be about more than just Chinese family values. It's expensive for the government to care for so many retirees.\n\nConvincing their children that it is their duty to chip in may be a smart way for the country to save money, said Chen Honglin, a university professor in Shanghai. Until then, China's elderly find other ways to keep their minds off the children they are missing.\n\nEvery morning, Wang Pei Lan comes with her husband to Lu Xun Park. The Shanghai retiree says her three children work at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, but they weren't able to visit often enough.\n\n\"We have nothing to do at home,\" Wang said, while busily knitting under a large tree.\n\nThe Xintu Center for Community Health Promotion in Shanghai is an organization that cares for old and disabled people. Many of the volunteers are retirement-age people looking to help others, said Zhang Yan who works at the center.\n\n## Helping Each Other\n\nSome of the elderly struggle with loneliness and some have depression, Zhang said. Those without children nearby often hurt the most, she said.\n\nSo the center tries to help. It has a telephone help line staffed by counselors. There are weekly group meetings and regular visits from a hospital.\n\nMost of the center's retiree volunteers say they feel depressed, she said. It can be hard to get them to accept the services that they need.\n\n\"Chinese people like to help each other, but sometimes they need the help,\" Zhang said.'"

            "text": "\tBEIJING - For Americans, Chinese New Year brings to mind colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.\n\nIn China, it involves millions of people returning home. The Lunar New Year festival, or Spring Festival, starts Friday for this Year of the Horse. Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages for the holiday. It's an occasion to share time and gifts with family and friends.\n\nYet, Chinese New Year has become a busy time of travel across the world's most populated country. Hundreds of millions have moved from rural areas to cities in recent years. When they return home, some call it \"the world's largest human migration.\"\n\nDuring the New Year's festivities, government officials estimate people will make 3.6 billion trips. More than 154 million train tickets have been sold already.\n\n## The Holiday's Many Strains\n\nFor the past week, train stations in Beijing have been mobbed. Subways were crowded with passengers carrying bags and gifts. On a subway last Saturday, a woman with luggage dropped a box of kiwis she was carrying. As the fruits rolled around the car, several passengers were kind enough to pick them up and return them to her.\n\nAirports also are busy, but with a different class of customer. They're used by wealthy Chinese who are returning home. Others spend the week in beach resorts. Passengers will make about 42 million air trips during the 40-day period, according to a Chinese government report.\n\nFor weeks in China, newspapers have published reports about the strain of the holiday. Obtaining train tickets is a hassle. Anxiety abounds about what gifts to take. For the young unwed, there will be unavoidable questions about why they haven't yet married. For those who don't or can't return home, there'll be some guilt. They'll regret not following through on tradition.\n\nEarlier this month, a Chinese woman in Guangdong province was so upset over her long-lost son that she purchased a front-page ad in the Chinese Melbourne Daily. The newspaper is published in Australia, where the son is living. She urged him to visit for the holiday.\n\n\"We hope you will come home for Lunar New Year,\" read the ad. \"Dad and Mom will never again pressure you to marry.\"\n\n## In One Migrant Community\n\nRelying on Chinese media for reports about Spring Festival can be tricky. A story in the China Daily reported that 40 percent of Chinese migrant workers surveyed said they wouldn't return home for the holiday this year.\n\nOf those who said they wouldn't return, nearly half said they were too embarrassed to. They felt that they'd earned too little money in the past year. The survey was taken of 13,156 migrant workers nationwide by job-hunting site daguu.com.\n\nIt was an astounding finding. Beijing is reportedly home to 8 million migrant workers, more than a third of its population. Most of them are young men from all corners of the country. They moved to Beijing to take factory or office jobs, often living in run-down and crowded conditions.\n\nThe survey's findings couldn't easily be checked. A well-known migrant community called Pi Village sits in northwestern Beijing. Nearly everyone there, it seemed, was traveling or had plans to. One man estimated that 90 percent of the migrant workers in Pi Village had already left. He believed that many of the rest would be leaving soon.\n\nOne woman staying behind said she wasn't going home because her employer hadn't paid her. When she was asked for her name and details, she got nervous and walked away.\n\nA day earlier, Chinese officials reported that they were trying to help migrants get money they were owed. The money could help migrants return home for Spring Festival. Pressure on stingy and crooked bosses had recovered $1.8 billion in unpaid wages for more than 1.5 million workers across the country, according to the Chinese government.\n\nIn China, there's a popular song with a line that goes: \"No matter if you have money or not, you should return home for Spring Festival.\"\n\nIt's a nice thought. But for millions of workers here, returning home depends on whether they get paid.'"

            "text": "\tSHANGHAI - Young, professional women in China are coming under a lot of pressure to get married. Their parents, the government, scholars and even some businesses are all in on it.\n\nThe women are called shengnu. It's not a nice nickname. The translation is \"leftover women.\"\n\nKaren Xie is one of them. Xie has met about one man a month for the last two years. They've all been Mr. Wrong.\n\nSome were too short or too fat, she says. Some didn't express enough tenderness. For her last date, her parents fixed her up with a man from their hometown. Xie knew it was over as soon as she saw him.\n\n\"He was a little bald, he had no hair in the middle of his head,\" said Xie, 32.\\n## Enjoying Their Freedom\n\nXie earns a good salary at a media firm. She has her own place to live on the edge of Shanghai. She and her parents bought it to help her chances of marriage. \"Maybe my standards are too high, but I don't require an apartment\" from a husband, she said.\n\nWomen like Xie should have their pick of possible husbands. Chinese men between the ages of 20 and 44 will outnumber women by 24 million by 2020, one forecast says. China has a rule that says a family can have only one child. More families try to have boys.\n\nYet more and more educated and working Chinese women say they just can't find a man equal to them. Others say that after years of schooling, they want to enjoy their freedom past age 27. That is the age when they are expected to settle down.\n\nParents fear that their daughters will end up childless and lonely. They also worry the women could have money troubles.\n\nIt's become almost impossible for women like Xie to avoid being reminded of being single.\n\nFliers and email promote a matchmaking events. There are several TV shows about shengnu. They all have similar plotlines: Smart, beautiful, successful women try everything to get a man.\\n## Facing Lots Of Pressure\n\nNot even a shopping spree can help a shengnu get her mind off marriage. The shops are full of reminders: \"Twelve products to help shengnu forget about loneliness!\" said one store ad. Suggested items included a garlic peeler, rainbow-colored bedding and a one-seater couch.\n\nShengnu are being blamed for all kinds of things, explained Sandra Bao. She started a group called Leftover Attitude in Shanghai. It supports unmarried professional women. \"Parents are pressuring us, the media label us, there's a whole industry of matchmakers and others out there telling us it's a problem to be single.\"\n\nThe pressure seems to be working.\n\nThe average age of a woman's first marriage in China is rising. But by age 35, more than 90 percent of Chinese women have married, said Roseann Lake. She is writing a book on marriage in China.\n\n\"Chinese women are only left over for a limited time, which makes the fact that they're labeled 'leftovers' even more hideous,\" Lake said.\n\nMany parents do all that they can to help their children find mates. Lake said she knows of one mother who posed as her daughter online to set up dates for her.\\n## Some Shengnu Pushing Back\n\nOthers turn to matchmakers. In Shanghai, there are about 130 such agencies. Some charge more than $16,000 in fees, according to Zhou Juemin, head of the Shanghai Matchmaking Association.\n\nThere is an area of Shanghai's People's Park known as Matchmaking Corner. On weekends, middle-aged women comb through papers strung out like shorts on clotheslines. Each lists a single person's age, height, and education, along with a photo.\n\nChinese women traditionally pair off with men of equal or higher income, education and age. So it can be difficult for women at the top to find matches. Adding to the pressure, some women insist that a groom have a house.\n\nThough the pressure on shengnu looks unlikely to go away any time soon, there is a small movement pushing against it.\n\nBao's Leftover Attitude group has more than 2,000 members nationwide. And Los Angeles-based author Joy Chen published \"Do Not Marry Before Age 30.\" It sits on the shelves in Chinese bookstores, alongside self-help titles about landing a man.'"

            "text": "\tFor years, chocolate lovers have taken comfort in a pleasing fact: Chocolate can be good for you. It's long been known that bittersweet dark chocolate improves cardiovascular health. The tasty treat helps the heart and blood vessels.\n\nHowever, scientists have been unsure just why this is so. Until now, that is.\n\nOn Tuesday, scientists announced that they had solved the chocolate mystery: It seems that certain chocolate-loving microbes in the gut are responsible. They turn an otherwise indigestible part of the candy into something useful: anti-inflammatory compounds - that is, mixtures that bring down swelling.\n\nScientists started by setting up a series of test tubes. The idea was to copy what goes on in the human gut. The gut is known by scientists as the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Essentially, it is a long tube that starts at the mouth, feeds into the stomach, and ends at the anus.\n\n## \"Down The GI Tract\"\n\nIn the test tubes, the scientists mixed cocoa powder with digestive juices and enzymes. These are what the body uses to break down food. They then exposed the powder to bacteria found in human feces.\n\nThe scientists observed something interesting after the cocoa was \"digested.\" Long molecules called polyphenolic polymers remained within the gut. A molecule is the smallest unit or part of any substance.\n\nThe polyphenolic polymer molecules are too large to cross the walls of the gut, says scientist John Finley. Thus they can't be absorbed into the rest of the body as nutrients. Nutrients provide nourishment and food for the body. They are what keeps our body's motor running.\n\nPolyphenolic polymer molecules didn't seem to be of much use at first. They \"do nothing for us except travel down the GI tract,\" Finley said.\n\nThat is, until they run into some of the many microbes that inhabit the human colon: in particular, Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria. The colon is the main part of the intestine, which in turn is part of the GI tract. The intestine runs from the bottom end of the stomach to the anus.\n\n## Chocolate-Loving Microbes\n\n\"These little guys say, 'Hey - there's something in there that I can use,' and they start to break it down,\" Finley said.\n\nThe smaller molecules that result from this breaking down can travel through the gut wall. Once they leave the gut, they can be used by the body.\n\n\"These materials are anti-inflammatory,\" Finley said. That is, they bring down inflammation, or pain and swelling, inside the body. This helps prevent \"some forms of cardiovascular disease\" caused by inflammation. In other words, by reducing swelling they lower the risk of various heart diseases.\n\nA number of past studies suggest that dark chocolate can cause blood vessels to widen. That in turn lowers blood pressure, as blood is able to flow more easily. High blood pressure can be dangerous: It leads to heart attacks and other serious health problems. White chocolate and milk chocolate don't provide this benefit, only dark chocolate. Dark chocolate has more cocoa in it, so it's more powerful.\n\nIt has been unclear exactly why this blood-vessel widening happens. Scientists, however, have focused on two kinds of flavanols, which are found in plants and are considered healthy.\n\nFinley said these flavanols were among those that were at first poorly digested. Like the polyphenolic polymers, they were eventually broken down by gut microbes. The other main part of the cocoa that was broken down was dietary fiber. It makes up almost one-third of cocoa powder.\n\n## Cocoa Pill From Mars\n\nFinley said that the amount of cocoa powder needed to produce healthful effects was relatively small: about two tablespoons a day.\n\nThere is a problem with dark chocolate, though, Finley said: the amount of sugar and fat that chocolate candy contains. He said a healthy alternative to candy is putting cocoa powder on oatmeal, as he does.\n\nFinley said that the healthful stuff in cocoa powder might one day be put into pills. He noted that Mars Inc. is interested in doing just that. Mars is the company that makes M&amp;M candy.\n\nBut he said he wasn't very excited by the idea of taking a pill.\n\n\"I would rather eat a big old chocolate cookie,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tST. LOUIS - Shirley Booker doesn't want to live next door to a farm. But when she looks out her front door, all she sees is green.\n\nBooker has lived in her St. Louis home for 37 years. Up until last summer, she felt like she lived in a city. Then people came to her neighborhood, called St. Louis Place, and planted vegetables all around her house, including corn and soybeans. She doesn't like it.\n\nAbout one mile of Booker's neighborhood is now a farm. A farming company called Family Roots International runs the farm, which is on 62 acres of St. Louis Place land. The company was founded by an Olympic athlete from St. Louis named Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Family Roots planted vegetables in the once empty land.\n\nThe company is on a mission. It wants to find ways to grow good crops like corn an other vegetables in ground that might not be so healthy. The ground might have lead or pavement in it, which makes it hard for plants to grow.\n\n## \"I Don't Want To Live On A Farm\"\n\nFamily Roots would like to make the soil healthy, grow plants, bring jobs and make money. It agreed to lease 62 acres to complete its mission.\n\nBut what Family Roots wants to do and what some of the people who live in the neighborhood want is very different.\n\nHomeowner Joyce Cooks wants to live in the city, not in the middle of a cornfield.\n\n\"I'm all for progress,\" Cooks said. \"But I don't want to live on a farm. I'm a city girl.\"\n\nFamily Roots attorney Maurice Foxworth says that he spoke with St. Louis Place residents before planting began, but some people who live there say that is not true. They claim that they only learned of the farming plan early last summer. That's when people who spray chemicals to keep bugs and mice away came into the neighborhood.\n\nBut Booker says that the spray didn't keep the pests away. Bugs, possums, foxes, deer, fat rats and even a peacock can be seen roaming, she says. Booker also says that the eight-foot corn stalks have attracted car racing on the streets, which is against the law.\n\n## Can't See The Neighbors For The Stalks\n\nKaren Hancock has lived in a little red brick house in the neighborhood for almost 50 years. She says she finds the tall corn stalks a little \"weird.\"\n\nShe also says they are a little scary. A few weeks ago, a man who was running from the police fled through the corn to hide in her yard. She was able to chase him away.\n\nPeople who work for Family Roots don't agree that crime is going up in the neighborhood because of corn stalks. They say complaints have been exaggerated. A St. Louis police spokeswoman said there was no jump in crime in the area over the summer.\n\nBut still the neighbors are nervous because of the corn. The few people who live in the neighborhood all know each other. Several said there was once a sense of safety in being able to see each others' houses across the mostly-empty blocks.\n\n\"I can't see anybody now,\" Hancock said.\n\nFoxworth said he understands neighbors' worries about the tall corn stalks. He wants the people to know that Family Roots can grow something other than corn. He says the company can \"find a way around it.\"\n\nNext year, something shorter may be planted.\n\n## Sweet Corn Harvested\n\nFor now, Family Roots has begun to harvest sweet corn. The company hired locals to pick it, Foxworth said. The vegetables were given to food banks and churches, and to anyone from the neighborhood who asked.\n\nFoxworth took some home, too. \"It was delicious,\" he said.\n\nBut Booker, Cooks and Hancock all said they don't want to eat any of the vegetables growing in their backyards. Having to live in the middle of cornfields is enough for Booker.\n\nThe other weekend, she said, she bought some corn to make for dinner. She put it on the table and watched as her grown children ate it.\n\n\"But I just couldn't,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE  - Usually, families with kids will move from the city center to the suburbs. In the suburbs, they can find peace and quiet, more space and good schools.\n\nNow more and more parents are choosing to keep their families downtown. City centers offer something much different than the suburbs: a city lifestyle. This means living in a crowded city with lots of things going on, being closer to work and not needing a car.\n\nThese parents are pushing cities to become more family-friendly. In Seattle, Minneapolis, Denver and elsewhere, parents are calling for more schools and playgrounds. They're also looking for cheaper housing for families near city centers.\n\n\"The benefit of living in the city far outweighed what we would get by moving out to the suburbs,\" said Jenny Kelly, age 32.\n\nKelly helped start a parents group in 2013 called Parents for a Better Downtown Seattle.\n\nShe and her husband Michael moved to Seattle in their 20s. They moved downtown, to the city center. They stayed when they had 2-year-old Elea. Both parents walk to work from their apartment in Pioneer Square. In the small space, the laundry room also serves as Elea's bedroom.\n\n## What Downtowns Need Now\n\nKelly and other parents recently pushed the city to build a public school downtown. As Seattle discussed changing the area along the water, the parent group asked for a playground.\n\nThe city of Seattle is offering home builders benefits if they provide space for a school. Still, no one has taken the city up on the offer.\n\nSome cities are responding to families' needs. Portland, Oregon, changed building rules to allow family-friendly apartments with outdoor courtyards. Baltimore has promised to add 10,000 families to the city.\n\nFamilies with children are a good sign of a neighborhood's health, according to Gary Johnson. He works for the city of Seattle.\n\nFor decades, Seattle has had a reputation as a city without children. In the 1960s and 1970s, families moved to the suburbs. The number of children dropped.\n\nSeattle has a smaller percentage of children than the rest of the state of Washington or the United States as a whole.\n\nStill, Seattle is holding on to the kids it has, according to one study. While some cities are seeing the percentage of kids go down, the number is going up in Seattle.\n\nThere are more kids going to school in downtown Seattle, according to the Downtown Seattle Association, a local business group. The number of kids who were in kindergarten through eighth grade jumped by nearly one third between 2007 and 2012.\n\nParents used to stay in downtown Seattle until their kids were age 5, then many would leave, said Jon Scholes, who runs the business group. He is raising 5-year-old twins downtown. Now parents are staying longer, Scholes said. Schools, parks and other conveniences matter, he said.\n\n## Just Say \"No\" To Yard Work\n\nMelissa and Aaron Whitney moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. They sold their large house in the suburbs and bought a small apartment downtown.\n\n\"We thought once we got married, we had to buy a house in the suburbs,\" said Aaron Whitney, age 40.\n\nIn the suburbs, though, the couple quickly realized they didn't enjoy home repairs. They also did not like yard work. They frequently went downtown to have fun. Eventually they moved to downtown Minneapolis with their son, who is now 2 years old.\n\nThe couple said they would like to see more green spaces in the city. They also want cheaper housing. A new school opens up in downtown this fall. They will might send their son to school there.\n\n## Raising Kids With Culture\n\nLindsey Carillo is 31 years old. She grew up in a suburb but wanted to expose her kids to city life.\n\n\"It gives them a different way of living,\" said the mother of two kids. \"I want my kids to have a cultured experience growing up.\"\n\nHer family of four shares an apartment in a tall building in downtown Seattle. It is small, with only two bedrooms. Sometimes her son wishes he had a back yard and that he could walk to school.\n\nStill, she says, \"he loves to show off where we live.\"'"

Now, more and more of them are children. Violence in Central America is growing worse. Children are gathering along the border to get away.\n\nIndiana is a long way from the Mexican border. Many children from Central America caught at the border were sent to Indiana by the government. They ended up in immigration holding centers and were treated badly.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, called the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village to hold immigrant children. It was supposed to house the most dangerous children.\n\nThese children arrived at the Southwest Indiana Regional Youth Village. Police at the border had spotted tattoos on some of them that made them seem like gang members. Others were stopped because of crimes in their home countries. Some had caused trouble or run away from other housing centers in the United States. A few had U.S. police records.\n\n## Their Legal Rights\n\nI run the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's law school. I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to help these kids.\n\nThe U.S. government helped pay for my law students and me to meet with the children. We explained their legal rights to them. We let them know what they could expect in immigration court. We found lawyers willing to work for free for some of them.\n\nThe children told us stories of fleeing abuse at home, gangs and drugs. Some were mistreated in other U.S. immigrant centers.\n\nMany were reunited with family in the United States. Others decided to go home. Some were sent home.\n\nAt one point, the immigrant children in Vincennes peacefully protested against their conditions. The response was harsh. Police arrived with billy clubs and a police dog. Children were not allowed out of their rooms. Some were put in rooms by themselves and allowed no human contact.\n\nWhen they told my law school students of their bad treatment, we reported it. The U.S. government stopped the Vincennes center from holding immigrant children.\n\n## Asking For Protection Here\n\nThe U.S. is handling the situation with immigrant children today just like it did for the kids at Vincennes. It's just happening in a much larger way.\n\nU.S. law protects people who have been mistreated, but it is not perfect. President Obama is trying to protect these children as best he can.\n\nPeople afraid of being hurt can ask for protection in the U.S. It doesn't matter what country they come from. Our laws allow them the right to ask to stay here. They are given rights as refugees.\n\nNot every child should be allowed to stay. But just turning children away goes against our laws and our history. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their rights protected. They should be allowed to stay when they deserve to, and sent back home safely when necessary.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Linda Kelly is the M.

President Obama is partly to blame. He has handled the situation badly. His actions even encourage people to make the dangerous and illegal crossing into the U.S.\n\nObama must secure the border and stop illegal crossings.\n\nThe president is trying to do too much. He wants to keep Latino leaders happy because he needs their support. At the same time, he wants to convince Central Americans not to start the dangerous trip north.\n\nObama made things worse with his actions. He made people think immigrants here illegally might be allowed to stay here. In 2012, Obama decided to stop sending children back to their home countries if they had already spent years in the U.S.  Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their court hearings. It started rumors that the U.S. was allowing people to stay.\n\n## Weakly Guarded Border?\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez blames the problem on confusion about U.S. border rules. The Central American leader said this confusion \"pulls\" people to cross the U.S. border.\n\nHernandez also said drug violence and gangs \"push\" people to leave their countries. El Salvador and Guatemala face the same problems. Unfortunately, these are poor nations. Their governments cannot handle these challenges.\n\nSupporters of refugees say that most people crossing the border have good reasons.\n\nA survey in May by the Border Patrol found something different. Nearly all of the immigrants they interviewed made the trip because they heard the border was weakly guarded.  So-called \"coyotes\" make money sneaking people into the U.S. The coyotes promise people that it will be easy to get across the U.S. border.\n\n## Stop Illegal Crossings\n\nPeople fleeing war or natural disasters in their home country are refugees. The U.S. must protect them. However, the United Nations should help refugees in their own countries. It shouldn't wait for them to run all the way to the U.S. border.\n\nNo one should risk the trip through Mexico. Many migrants are abused, robbed or killed along the journey.\n\nA weak border makes it too easy for people to risk their lives. We must change that now.\n\nSecuring the border is Obama's job. It seems like he wants Congress to deal with it. But it's not the job of Congress. He must stop illegal crossings and send most border crossers back home. He must also put an end to rumors that people who entered illegally will be allowed to stay.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Roger F.

            "text": "\tPHOENIX - To graduate, high school students in Arizona now have to pass the U.S. citizenship test. Arizona is the first state to pass such a law.\n\nNormally, immigrants have to pass this test to become U.S. citizens. The test asks questions about the Founding Fathers, the Bill of Rights and U.S. presidents.\n\nOther states may pass similar laws this year. But some educators warn it's not the answer to the nation's poor knowledge of civics. Civics is the study of how the government works.\n\n## Skimming The Surface?\n\nFewer than 12 states make students take any test about American government to finish high school. In some states, students don't even need to pass.\n\n\"This has been building for a long time,\" said Ted McConnell. He works with former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to increase learning about government in schools. McConnell said he and others are worried that lawmakers are only skimming the surface of what students need to know.\n\nSome education leaders are worried about the state of teaching civics.\n\nIn 2010, a national test looked at educational progress. Only 1 out of every 7 high school seniors got a passing score in American history. If people don't understand the importance of being a citizen they don't vote. The number of people who voted in the last elections for Congress was the lowest in years.\n\n## Is A Test The Right Answer?\n\nThe Joe Foss Institute is a group that wants to change that. It wants all 50 states to use the U.S. citizenship test for high school students by 2017. The institute says lawmakers in 15 states are expected to consider it this year.\n\nThe Arizona law requires high school students to correctly answer 60 questions on the test to pass. There are 100 questions in total. Passing the test is required to earn a high school or GED diploma. The law goes into effect for the 2016-17 school year.\n\nMcConnell said people pushing for the citizenship test have the \"right problem, wrong solution.\"\n\nSome experts say this exam does not capture what they want students to learn.\n\n## Would More Classes Be Better?\n\nSome states have their own civics exams. Those test knowledge that the U.S. citizenship exam does not. They ask questions about equality before the law, the purpose of democratic government, and being a good citizen.\n\nThe citizenship exam is actually too simple, some experts say. They prefer more civics classes.\n\nThe new rule also comes as part of a larger argument over testing. There are worries the No Child Left Behind act and other laws prevent the understanding of civics.\n\nPeople fear too much testing means there is less time for teaching topics like civics. One study found this to be true. More than a quarter of the school districts said they spent less time on social studies.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - There was a famous march on Washington for civil rights 50 years ago this week. Tens of thousands of people from across the United States gathered in the nation's capital on Aug. 24 to remember that march. But they also said that there is more work to do to make the country fair for all.\n\nThe group assembled under blue skies around the base of the Lincoln Memorial. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech there 50 years ago. On Saturday, speaker after speaker said everyone needs to work to make sure that people of all races are treated equally and get along.\n\nRep. John Lewis, D-Ga., was the only speaker from the 1963 march. He fired up Saturday's crowd. He pushed them to fight against a Supreme Court decision last June. The decision struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Passing that act was an important civil rights victory in the 1960s.\n\n\"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.,\" he told the crowd, referring to the 1965 \"Bloody Sunday\" march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Protesters were brutally beaten back then on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. \"I got arrested 40 times during the '60s, beaten and left bloodied and unconscious. But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight and continue to fight, and you must fight.\"\n\n## T-Shirts And Protest Signs\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder echoed his views. He said Saturday's event was \"about far more than reflecting on our past.\"\n\nThe \"struggle must, and will, go on in the cause of our quest for justice\" until every American can exercise their right to vote, he said. It must continue until \"all are treated equally and fairly in the eyes of the law.\"\n\nThe people around the Lincoln Memorial were celebrating. But they were also thinking about the past, and the future.\n\nMany young people and adults wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs protesting the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Martin's mother was cheered loudly when she appeared.\n\nEmma Daniels, 70, wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march. Daniels pointed to where she and other members of her Georgia church stood 50 years ago.\n\n## Coming Together Peacefully\n\n\"I wanted my children to have the same feeling that I had - change,\" said Daniels. She said there has been a lot of change. \"We're going forward, it's slow, but we're moving forward.\"\n\nDaniels said she noticed a different atmosphere on Saturday than in the 1963 march. She said she remembers there being an air of concern then. Many of the 250,000 people who were there that day had traveled through the South. Whites and blacks were separate in the South back then. The people who had gone to the rally feared being stopped by police officers who did not like them.\n\n\"This is so much more relaxed than when we came up - like a family reunion,\" she said. Melanie Marshall, Daniels' daughter, said Saturday's event gave her a greater appreciation for the right to assemble.\n\n\"In Egypt, people are fighting and killing each other in the street,\" she said. \"We're lucky to be able to come together like this, in a peaceful way.\"\n\n## Obama Speech On Aug. 28\n\nDarryl Simmons, 21, made the bus journey to Washington with fellow students from South Carolina's Claflin University. He said he \"just wanted to relive history.\"\n\nHe said, \"We're not exactly dealing with what happened 50 years ago, but there's stuff going on and we're here for justice.\" Simmons is president of Claflin's Young Democrats.\n\nWednesday is the March on Washington's official anniversary. Another large crowd is expected at the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28. President Barack Obama will speak at the spot where King made history.\n\nObama is the nation's first African-American president. He is expected to discuss the progress and problems the nation has faced in following King's dream. In [his speech](http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf), King said he dreamed that his children \"will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\"'"

            "text": "\tCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - Two lawmakers who worked to pass Colorado's strict gun laws lost their jobs on Tuesday. Senate President John Morse and state Senator Angela Giron were defeated in a close vote in a special election to kick them out of office. The state election turned into a national debate over gun control.\n\nMorse and Giron were important people when it came to getting the gun laws passed. Some gun owners and their supporters do not like the laws. They collected thousands of signatures earlier in the year and organized a vote. This asked the people of Colorado Springs whether they wanted Morse and Giron to continue working or not. It was called a recall vote.\n\nBoth lawmakers lost narrowly. They will be replaced by two men who were against the gun restrictions.\n\nIt was the first time that this happened in Colorado. Morse and Giron helped pass strict gun control laws last winter. The laws were written after several mass shootings in 2012. These included a school in Newtown, Connecticut, and a movie theater in Aurora outside Denver.\n\n## Recall Vote Turned Into Debate Over Guns\n\nThe new Colorado laws said that guns should only hold 15 bullets at a time. They also demand background checks on every gun owner. But some gun owners felt that their opinions were ignored when the laws were made. The laws took effect on July 1.\n\nMorse said he would continue to fight for control of guns. He believes that the laws he made make Colorado safer. Morse said that this was worth the sacrifice of losing his job. \"If it cost me my political career, that's a small price to pay.\"\n\nGiron told her supporters that \"this will make us stronger.\" She said that she had no regrets about voting for the stricter gun laws. \"I'm a fighter,\" she said. \"We will win in the end, because we are on the right side.\"\n\nThis vote was important to many people across the country. Some believe there should be more rules about who owns guns. They believe this would mean that shootings like those in Newtown and Aurora would happen less often.\n\nOther voters think that owning a gun is matter of freedom. They believe the government should not get involved in gun laws. The supporters of both sides spoke in the debate in Colorado.\n\n## Gun Fight Will Continue In Colorado\n\nThe gun owners felt that Morse and Giron had made the laws without asking the public first. The campaign against them started in Colorado. But the arguments were watched from all over the United States. And thousands of dollars were spent by those on both sides.\n\nThe National Rifle Association campaigned against the state senators. The NRA believes that there should be no more laws on guns. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Morse and Giron. Bloomberg thinks that there should be more control over who can own guns.\n\nBoth sides argued hard in the days leading up to the vote. It turned the vote into an intense debate in Colorado and across the United States.\n\nThe people who do not believe in gun control are hoping to organize another vote in 2014. They want to get rid of the new gun laws completely. A group of sheriffs has asked a judge to throw out the laws.\n\nThe results of Tuesday's vote pushed forward Morse's retirement date. He was first elected in 2006. He would have left the senate in 2014. Giron had hoped to win re-election next year.'"

The flag is a symbol of the Confederacy from the Civil War.\n\nLawmakers from South Carolina and the 2016 Republican presidential candidates have different opinions about what to do with the flag.\n\nLast week, nine African-Americans were killed by a gunman at a church in Charleston. The gunman supported the Confederate flag.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Confederacy fought the Union to keep slavery in America. They lost the war in 1865.\n\nJames Clyburn is an African-American lawmaker in the national government. He says the flag needs to be removed. Symbols like this flag are connected to a history of racism in America and they help racism continue, he said.\n\n## \"Rich History\" Painful For Many\n\nSenator Tim Scott is also an African-American lawmaker from South Carolina. He said the Confederate flag is part of the \"rich history\" of the state. Still, he said that it also represents a history of pain for African-Americans.\n\nIn 2000, the flag was taken off the top of the main government building. It is still on a part of that government land.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham is from South Carolina. He is running for president. He said it is time for the people of South Carolina to think about making a change again.\n\n\"The flag represents to some people a civil war, and that was the symbol of one side,\" Graham said. \"To others, it's a racist symbol, and it's been used in a racist way.\"\n\n## Some Republicans Say State Should Decide\n\nRepublicans who are running for president disagree on what to do.\n\nMitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, posted on Twitter asking for the flag to be taken down. \"It is a symbol of racial hatred,\" he said. \"Remove it now to honor Charleston victims.\"\n\nSome say South Carolina needs to decide as a state.\n\nRick Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said that he doesn't think that the national government or people running for president \"should be making decisions on everything. This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina.\"\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker said that the time is not right for this conversation. Out of respect, he said, \"we should allow the families of the loved ones to bury their dead\" first.\n\n## Others Say Flag Should Come Down\n\nOthers said the flag should come down.\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich is expected to announce soon that he is running for president. He said that it is \"up to the people of South Carolina to decide, but if I were a citizen of South Carolina, I'd be for taking it down.\"\n\nIn 2001, Confederate flags were removed from the Florida state Capitol. Jeb Bush was Florida's governor at that time, and he is now running for president. He said it was the right thing to do to take down the flags and put them in a museum. It would not have been right for them to \"fly as a symbol of what we are today as a state.\"\n\nSenator Marco Rubio is a Republican from Florida. He said the people of South Carolina will make the right decision for themselves. \"The next president of the United States will not make that decision.\"\n\nRubio said he supported taking down the flag in Florida. He also supported a law that does not allow artifacts from wars to be \"relocated, removed, disturbed or altered.\"\n\nCarly Fiorina is a Republican running for president. She said the Confederate flag is a symbol that makes many people upset. Still, she does not think that her personal opinion is important.\n\nShe said the important matter is \"what the people of South Carolina choose to do next.\"'"

During that time, she never dreamed of hitting a child - not even once.\n\nKavanaugh is now a fifth-grade teacher at St. Margaret of Scotland School in St. Louis. Previously, she taught in a school where corporal punishment was used. Simply put, that means that kids who misbehaved were punished with a spanking.\n\nShe never used corporal punishment herself - but she knows there are teachers across the state who do. She wants it stopped.\n\n\"Corporal punishment does not make for a more peaceful, happier child,\" she said.\n\n## Some Districts Don't Allow It\n\nKavanaugh and about 30 of her fifth-grade students attended a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would outlaw corporal punishment in the state. Democratic state Sen. Joe Keaveny is in charge of the bill. The Senate Committee on Progress and Development passed it on Wednesday afternoon. All members voted in favor of the bill.\n\n\"We need to stop\" hitting \"our kids,\" Keaveny said.\n\nMissouri is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in schools. The latest states to outlaw it were New Mexico in 2011 and Ohio in 2009..\n\nIn 2009, at least 70 Missouri school districts allowed the use of corporal punishment.\n\nHowever, many districts in the St. Louis area do not permit it. These include St. Louis itself, Clayton, Lindbergh and Riverview Gardens.\n\nThe Ferguson-Florissant district doesn't allow it either. District officials believe there are better ways to react to bad behavior. They range from calling in parents to suspending or expelling students.\n\nBut some districts do allow the practice. About 4,200 students across the state were physically punished in the 2009-2010 school year.\n\nThe Fox School District in Jefferson County used to allow spanking in its schools. In the early 2000s, however, it changed its rules, said district official Lorenzo Rizzi.\n\n\"I think the board of education no longer sees it as a proper way to punish kids,\" Rizzi said. Corporal punishment \"doesn't change behavior,\" he said. Often, it just makes things worse.\n\n## Should Bill Cover Private Schools?\n\nThe move away from corporal punishment is happening across the country. For the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished, compared with about 223,000 in the 2005-2006 school year.\n\nA decrease, however, is not enough for Kavanaugh. She wants to see teachers switch to rewarding students for good behavior.\n\n\"We need to\" ask \"more of teachers,\" she said.\n\nNo one spoke against the bill at Wednesday's hearing. However, Democratic state Sen. Gina Walsh voiced concern about including private schools in the bill. Walsh attended a Catholic school as a child.\n\n\"I do not support corporal punishment, but my parents sent me to a faith-based school ... I'm opposed to government\" telling such schools what they will teach, she said.\n\nSenate committee Chairwoman Jolie Justus said she wants to move the bill forward. Nonetheless, she thinks there could be a problem when it comes to private schools.\n\n\"I suspect we'll hear from people who don't want\" the state interfering \"in private schools,\" Justus said. \"At some point, we may need\" to make some changes when \"folks come and talk to us. Right now, I haven't heard\" from anyone who's against it.'"

Cruz is a Republican from Texas.\n\n\"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States,\" Cruz said in a speech to students.\n\n\"Ted! Ted!\" students yelled.\n\n\"It is the time for truth. It is the time for liberty,\" Cruz said in his speech.\n\n## College Announcement Aimed At Young People\n\nThe candidate talked about his parents and their humble backgrounds. His wife's parents were missionaries, who went to other countries to spread Christianity. His father was from Cuba. He pointed out that he had to borrow $100,000 to attend college and that he only paid it off a few years ago.\n\nThe speech spoke to many different groups within the Republican Party: Christians with traditional values, military supporters and members of the tea party, who want a smaller government. By making his announcement at a college, Cruz showed that he hopes to get young people involved in his campaign.\n\nOne of Cruz's advisers said he wants to unite conservatives behind his campaign. At the same time he will continue to show he is willing to stand up to political parties and will not budge in his beliefs. Cruz has pushed to end the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care law. He has also called for the Common Core education standards to be thrown out. Cruz has been doubtful about climate change, or global warming.\n\n## \"We Will Get Back To The Principles\"\n\nCruz had already announced his candidacy with a tweet sent Monday morning. Then he made the other announcement at Liberty. Cruz aimed to make it clear that he wants young people and evangelical Christians to vote for him.\n\n\"I'm running for president, and I hope to earn your support!\" he wrote early Monday. His tweet made him the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016. Many other Republicans want to be seen as the strongest candidate. However, none of them have officially announced.\n\nLater Monday, Cruz said it again, in person, at Liberty University.\n\n\"We stand together for liberty!\" Cruz said. \"This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington ... (It will come) when the American people stand together, and say, 'We will get back to the principles that made this country great.'\"\n\nThe student audience screamed like a concert crowd. Cruz got loud applause when he mentioned Patrick Henry, an American Revolution patriot from Virginia. They went wild when he talked about his own student loans. They cheered at the idea of shutting down the Internal Revenue Service, the government agency that collects taxes.\n\nThey booed loudly when Cruz mentioned President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\n## Competition Is Yet To Come\n\nCruz moved around the stage, urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals won on a variety of political issues. Imagine no \"Obamacare.\" Imagine no Common Core. \"Imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans.\"\n\nCruz's announcement will likely put the 2016 presidential race into high gear. By announcing early, Cruz can grab the spotlight from his rivals. Other Republicans with whom he will likely compete to be the Republican candidate are Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and surgeon Ben Carson. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania may also run. Both are popular among evangelical Christians.\n\nCruz, who is 44 years old, is a lawyer with degrees from Harvard and Princeton. He is best known for trying to block Obama's health care law from going into effect in 2013. His efforts included a 21-hour-long speech on the Senate floor. Such a speech is called a filibuster.\n\n## Lots Of Money To Raise\n\nCruz's campaign is looking to raise $40 million to $50 million for the primary race. In the primary he will face off against other Republicans. The winner of the primary race will be in the national election. That candidate will then face candidates from other political parties, like the Democrats. The Cruz campaign is also buying online advertising early. It hopes to get more people familiar with Cruz's name in time for the primary election.\n\nCruz has talked about raising money from average people. He will also seek donations from rich people who supported him in Congress.\n\nCruz lives in Houston with his wife and two young daughters. His wife, Heidi, works for a large bank. She will take time off so she can campaign with her husband.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - In 1961, the United States cut off all contact with Cuba. On Wednesday, a government official said the two nations will begin talks to repair their relationship.\n\nThe news comes after the release of American Alan Gross from a Cuban jail. In 2011, Cuba found him guilty of bringing cellphones and computers into Cuba, which was against the law. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail.\n\nCuba is an island nation less than 100 miles off the coast of Florida. In 1961, the United States ended its relations with Cuba. It was two years after communist leader Fidel Castro gained control. Under communism, the government owns all property and there is little freedom. The U.S. government was worried about communism spreading from Cuba to North America.\n\n## Travel And Trade Bans Could End\n\nCuba has freed Gross and sent him home to the United States. The 65-year-old Gross is in poor health. Secret talks over freeing him went on for more than a year.\n\nHis family in Maryland said he is weak and barely able to walk. To protest his imprisonment, he had refused medical care, food and visits from U.S. officials.\n\nIn exchange for Gross, the United States will release three Cubans. They were in jail for spying on anti-Castro groups in Florida. Florida is home to many Cuban refugees who are against Castro.\n\nThe government will open talks on other issues that divide the two nations. Under law, American companies are forbidden to do business with Cuba and sell most U.S. products there. Travel to Cuba is also limited. Congress passed this ban, also called an embargo, to pressure Cuba to end communism.\n\nOpening the door with Cuba \"will create a force for positive change,\" said Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. Ignoring Cuba achieved nothing, Durbin said.\n\n## Let's Start Talking\n\nLegally, only Congress can end the embargo. However, Congress is not needed to improve the relationship with Cuba. Obama can use his power as president to change relationships with any country. However, anti-Castro activists are likely to oppose it. Florida lawmakers will also likely object.\n\nExperts had predicted that Obama would try to improve the United States' relationship with Cuba. They thought he would do that sometime between the November elections and next spring's Summit of the Americas. The meeting is between the heads of North and South American countries. They will discuss issues they have in common. Latin American countries have insisted that Cuba be invited to the meeting.\n\nBefore now, a president would have lost popularity for speaking with Cuba. Experts say it is safer now. Times have changed. Many in the Cuban-American immigrant community do not feel as strongly about it. Also, it seems that the embargo has not achieved its goal. Communism is as strong as ever in Cuba.\n\nNo top government official believes the embargo will make Cuba more democratic, said Gregory B. Craig. He is the former White House lawyer. He spoke at a conference on Cuba in New York.\n\n## Who's Doing The Spying?\n\nOriginally, five Cuban intelligence agents were arrested by the FBI in 1998. They were called the Cuban Five. They were found guilty of spying and trying to discover military secrets.\n\nTwo of the five served time in jail. They have already returned home. In Cuba, the Cuban Five are called heroes and \"freedom fighters\" unfairly jailed by the United States.\n\nCuba has not yet released a public statement. Cuban President Raul Castro will speak soon on U.S.-Cuban relations, a Cuban official said. He is the brother of Fidel Castro, who is very sick.'"

            "text": "\tBERKELEY, Calif. - A group of fourth-graders in California came up with a plan after their 10-year-old classmate was deported to Mexico. They wrote an online letter asking for Rodrigo Guzman's return that got 2,788 signatures.\n\nThe fourth-graders at Jefferson Elementary school also created a Facebook page and posted videos to YouTube. They even met with California lawmakers to ask for help.\n\n\"We have to fight for Rodrigo's rights because he is not able to do it himself!\" Kyle Kuwahara said in a letter to President Barack Obama. \"Today I'm writing to you on Rosa Parks' 100th birthday to do the right thing. To allow Rodrigo and his family to return to their home, school and friends in Berkeley.\"\n\nEven though the children's \"Bring Rodrigo Home\" campaign was popular, it became clear Rodrigo's return to the United States would take time. The immigration system is complicated, the students were told.\n\n## \"He Misses His Friends\"\n\nImmigration law has to do with people who were not born in the United States who are trying to live in the U.S.\n\nRodrigo Javier Guzman Diaz was born in Mexico City. But he had had lived in Berkeley, Calif., since he was 2. His parents, Reyna Diaz Mayida and Javier Guzman Ponce, came here because they had family in the area. Diaz Mayida was educated as an accountant in Mexico. In California, she cleaned houses. Guzman Ponce worked as a cook.\n\nThis made it possible for Rodrigo to attend Jefferson until last winter.\n\nOn Jan. 10, Rodrigo was traveling with his parents to Mexico. They made the trip to update their tourist visas. The visas, or official papers, allowed Rodrigo and his parents to live in the United States. But during the trip the family was stopped by officers who guard the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nTheir Mexican travel papers and visas were taken away. Family members say they were never told why. They were told to leave the United States and stay in Mexico. It will take five years or longer to get new visas allowing the family to return to the U.S.\n\nAlmost all the family's belongings remain in Berkeley. Rodrigo now lives in a land that is unfamiliar.\n\n\"He's very quiet and sad sometimes,\" Diaz Mayida said on Skype from Mexico. \"He misses his friends and his home in Berkeley.\"\n\n## Building An Online World In A Game\n\nMany of the Jefferson students didn't think it was right that Rodrigo couldn't be with his friends at the school he'd been attending for years. Classmates began the \"Bring Rodrigo Home\" campaign after they learned about immigration laws and heard what had happened to Rodrigo.\n\nClassmates Kyle and his twin brother Scott worried that they'd lose touch with Rodrigo. They decided that an online video game called Minecraft would help them stay in touch.\n\nRodrigo and his classmates used to meet after school or on weekends at friends' houses to play Minecraft. Players have to work together to build things rather than competing to destroy one another.\n\nThe Internet allowed the Jefferson students to play Minecraft with Rodrigo. The kids were able to come up with their own rules. Borders, immigration laws and travel papers were not a problem. The game also made it seem as if Rodrigo was still next to them and not playing from thousands of miles away.\n\nThey created an online world called \"Rodrigo's World.\"\n\n## Rodrigo's Cube-Like Avatar\n\n\"We just wanted to be able to hang out somewhere with Rodrigo where none of this other stuff mattered,\" Scott said. \"The more we learn about immigration, the more unfair it seems.\"\n\nMore than 20 of Rodrigo's friends and classmates plunged into \"Rodrigo's World.\" Once there, they stumbled across Rodrigo's avatar, a blocky figure that appeared to be three stacked cubes with two boxy arms and a pixilated face.\n\nThe real Rodrigo also appeared. He played from his family's new home near Mexico City. An image of his face appeared on the laptop that was passed around the room.\n\n\"I want to say thank you for this, because it's helping me,\" Rodrigo said. \"But I still hope to come back and see everyone again.\"\n\nThe students continue to ask for lawmakers help. They also still log on to their computers at home or in small groups to enter \"Rodrigo's World.\"\n\nFor now, at least, it's a place they can find their friend.'"

            "text": "\tST. LOUIS - The roommates at Colgate University would talk about what they hoped to do after college. They were just freshmen, but they had some ideas. One wanted to be a lawyer. Another, a music producer. And then there was Ryan C. Fogle from Missouri. He wanted to join the FBI or CIA.\n\n\"Those were his goals in life,\" Ben Flicker, one of those roommates who is now an attorney in Denver, said Wednesday.\n\n\"He had this sense of service, of duty. And if he reached the FBI or CIA, that was the highest level of duty he could imagine giving to his country.\"\n\nFogle, 29, seems to have achieved his dream. And the whole world now seems to know about it.\n\nFogle is accused by Russia of spying for the CIA while posing as a low-level U.S. diplomat in Moscow. His arrest by Russian security services was in all the newspapers and news networks on Tuesday. It appeared to be designed to embarrass the United States and its spy agency.\n\n## A Knife, A Compass And Pepper Spray\n\nRussian television showed Fogle, wearing a blond wig under a baseball cap, and what were reportedly spy tools. These included wads of cash, several pairs of dark sunglasses, a compass and Moscow map, a knife, more wigs, and pepper spray. He also had a letter on him describing his plans.\n\nThen Fogle was kicked out of the country.\n\nBut the details of Fogle's arrest have raised suspicions. Some think he was used - even framed - to make a point in the political struggle between the United States and Russia.\n\nSenator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, said initial stories of Fogle's arrest only made her \"curiouser and curiouser.\"\n\n\"If the allegations Russia is making are true, it appears that our effort at gaining intelligence is rather lame. It reads like something you would see in a movie. I know our intelligence community is very sophisticated, so that's why it doesn't compute,\" she told reporters.\n\nAs a diplomat, Fogle was an employee of the U.S. State Department, which represents the United States in other countries. The State Department said little about the incident. A spokesman said it did not even come up during a meeting Wednesday between John Kerry, who heads the State Department, and a top Russian official.\n\n\"I wouldn't read too much into one incident one way or another,\" spokesman Patrick Ventrell said.\n\nThe FSB is like Russia's own version of the FBI. It claims Fogle was trying to get a Russian anti-terrorism officer to spy for the United States. The officer was an expert in the Caucasus region. That is where the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects had roots.\n\n## Not Genuine Tools\n\nEric O'Neill, a former FBI officer, said he believes Fogle really works for the CIA. And he probably was trying to recruit double agents. That seems believable. But the items that Fogle carried with him did not appear to be genuine tools of a CIA spy.\n\n\"I doubt he had this kit on him,\" he said. \"It was planted on him for political theater.\"\n\nO'Neill helped capture former FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who spied for the Russians for more than two decades. He thought the pepper spray and knife were not believable. The compass is unnecessary in an era of GPS. \"I doubt he was really running around with a wig,\" he said.\n\nThe wording of the letter intended to recruit the Russian official sounded fake to O'Neill. The letter, written in Russian, offered $100,000 plus $1 million a year. \"That's a pretty big budget,\" he said.\n\nHe also noticed the letter opens with \"Dear friend\" and closes with \"Your friends.\" Those phrases are similar to ones that Russians sent to Hanssen, O'Neill said. That is how Russian handlers wrote to Hanssen. It is not how Americans talk to Russians.\n\n\"That doesn't ring true to me,\" he said.\n\n## \"'70s Tradecraft\"\n\nPeter Earnest worked for the CIA for 36 years. He said it was possible a CIA agent would use a compass and wigs.\n\n\"I am not thrown off by what looks like '70s tradecraft,\" said Earnest, now executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. \"We used very traditional means to run spies.\"\n\nEarnest thought Fogle was likely caught by \"a dangle operation,\" where Russian agents created an opportunity that he could not resist. The Russians might have wanted to publicly embarrass the CIA after 10 Russian spies had their cover blown in 2010 in the United States.\n\nFogle is described as very smart, which make his supposed missteps hard to understand. He graduated from Colgate in Hamilton, New York, in 2006.\n\nAt Colgate, he had a double major of political science and international relations. He was an honor student and was recalled as politically conservative. He was focused on his goal.\n\nFlicker, his former roommate, said Fogle did not want to be near students who were doing drugs, fearful that it might affect his application to the FBI or CIA.\n\nFogle joined the U.S. foreign service in 2011, according to public records. He was reportedly working as a third secretary in the political division of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The title is a very low position in the U.S. diplomatic corps.'"

            "text": "b\"WASHINGTON - The new Congress has more women, African-American and Hispanic lawmakers than ever before.\n\nNearly all the lawmakers are white. However, both houses of Congress - the Senate and the House of Representatives - now have more lawmakers from other backgrounds. The new Congress builds on a gains achieved by the last Congress.\n\nThe Senate and the House both make up Congress, which makes the country's laws. A new Congress begins every two years. Some of the lawmakers stay the same and others get voted into or out of Congress.\n\n## Women, And African-Americans\n\nOn Tuesday, the 114th Congress began. A total of 107 women lawmakers were sworn in. There are 79 Democrats and 28 Republicans. A total of 87 women are members of the House. There were 83 members of the House in the 113th Congress.\n\nThe number of women in the Senate is the same as last year - 20. There are two new Republicans, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia. They balance out two female Democrats who lost their Senate seats in the elections in November. They were Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans both belong to political parties. Members of each party share the same ideas about running the government and tend to vote in the same way.\n\nAfrican-Americans also made large, and historic, gains. The new Congress has 48 lawmakers who are African-American. There are 46 in the House and two in the Senate. There were 43 African-American lawmakers in the 113th Congress.\n\nRepresentative Mia Love of Utah became Congress' first female African-American Republican lawmaker. Her arrival marks the first time that Congress has male and female African-Americans from both parties.\n\nRepublican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina made history last November. He became the first African-American senator elected in the South in more than 100 years.\n\n## Hispanics, And Asian-Americans\n\nThe number of Hispanic lawmakers increased by one to a total of 39. There are now 27 Democratic and 12 Republican Hispanic lawmakers. Thirty-six Hispanic lawmakers vote in the House, while three serve in the Senate.\n\nThe number of Asian-Americans and people whose families came from Pacific islands also increased by one. There are now 13 Democrats and one Republican from that group in the new Congress.\n\nReligion is an area where the new Congress remains mostly the same. About 9 out of 10 lawmakers are Christian, about the same as in the last Congress. Nearly 6 out of 10 lawmakers are Protestant, and 3 out of 10 are Catholic, according to a new study.\n\nThere is a bigger proportion of Protestants and Catholics in Congress than in the United States. About half of American adults are Protestant, and 1 out of 5 is Catholic.\n\nThe new Congress is also out of step with the public in another way. One-fifth of Americans say they do not belong to a religion. Only one member of the 114th Congress is not part of a religion. She is Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona.\""

The rules will be for people flying in from other countries as well as in the United States. They are to help control diseases such as Ebola from spreading.\n\nThe deadly Ebola virus has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa. However, last month a man named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled from the African country of Liberia to the United States. He appeared well when he got on the plane. Days after he arrived in Texas, he became sick.\n\nHe went to the hospital for treatment, but doctors didn't realize he had Ebola.\n\nWhen he became sicker three days later, he was rushed back to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. He was in isolation at the hospital and extremely ill.\n\nBecause doctors did not realize Duncan had Ebola, many are afraid the disease could have spread.\n\n## Keeping An Eye On Other People\n\nForty-eight people are being closely watched for signs of Ebola. Ten of those people are \"high risk\" because they were near Duncan when he was sick. The rest of the people spent time with the 10 high-risk group.\n\nDavid Lakey is the head of the health department for Texas. Lakey told reporters that they were continuing to watch the people who might have been near Duncan. They are still looking for more people who spent time with the high-risk group. Lakey said that no one in either the high-risk group or the low-risk group has gotten sick yet.\n\nHealth officials cleaned out the apartment where Duncan was living. They were afraid his personal items could spread the virus. Nearly all of them were thrown out.\n\n## Texas Governor Agrees With Screenings\n\nObama met with his top advisers who focus on the country's health and safety. He told reporters that the officials would look into screening before flights. They will consider increasing the amount of checking passengers need before getting on a plane.\n\nNew rules could be announced shortly, an official said.\n\nRick Perry is the governor of Texas. He also called for more screening at the borders because of the Duncan case.\n\nPerry announced his new 17-member task force to deal with contagious diseases. Perry said U.S. officials should be extra careful with screening wherever people are entering the United States. Screeners would take travelers' temperatures and do other checks to make sure they are not sick.\n\n## Two More Cases\n\nMeanwhile, a journalist who had been working in Africa arrived in Nebraska. Ashoka Mukpo came back to the United States to be treated for Ebola. He became sick with the disease while in Liberia.\n\nMukpo was taken to the Nebraska Medical Center. He will have to stay in a room by himself so other people do not catch Ebola from him. Mukpo became ill last week. He is the fifth American with Ebola to return to the United States for treatment during the outbreak.\n\nMukpo was able to walk off the plane on his own on Monday. Then he was placed on a stretcher for the ambulance ride to the hospital. His father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, said his son wanted to help the people of Liberia. Levy said Mukpo lived there for two years while working with a charity.\n\nIt was not known how Mukpo became infected. Levy said it may have happened when his son helped clean a vehicle in which someone had died.\n\nSpain is also facing a case of Ebola. Officials there said a nurse who was helping care for two priests infected with Ebola tested positive for the virus. In doing so, she became the first person known to have caught Ebola outside of West Africa. Everyone else got the disease by traveling there.\n\nThe World Health Organization says more than 3,400 people have died during the current outbreak. It is the worst outbreak of Ebola on record.\n\n>UPDATE:  Thomas Eric Duncan died at 7:51 a.m. Central Time on Oct. 8 at the Dallas hospital where he was being treated for Ebola.'"

Ebola has killed more than 2,000 people since it was discovered in March. Between 50 percent and 80 percent of the people who get it will die.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization (WHO) is worried that Ebola is spreading too fast.\n\nThousands more could become infected before the outbreak is brought under control, the WHO has warned. The outbreak began in Guinea. It quickly spread to the other West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal. This is the worst Ebola outbreak in modern history.\n\n## Not Enough Hospital Beds\n\nIn Liberia, the number of new cases is increasing faster than the number of hospital beds, the WHO said. As soon as a new Ebola care center opens, it is immediately full.\n\n\"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes,\" the WHO said. They spread the disease when they return home.\n\nThose who care for patients are among those hardest hit by Ebola. People get Ebola through contact with the organs, blood or other fluids of infected people. In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with Ebola. A total of 79 of them have died, according to the WHO.\n\nLiberia is still recovering from years of war. When the outbreak began, the country had only about one doctor for every 100,000 people. In contrast, the U.S. has 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, according to the World Bank. Every time a doctor or nurse gets sick or dies, it becomes harder to stop Ebola, the WHO said.\n\nThe fear of getting Ebola is keeping away many local and international doctors and nurses. Too few of them are coming to care for patients. There are not enough to slow down the spread of Ebola.\n\nSymptoms of Ebola include fever. People with the disease also experience weakness, muscle pain and headaches. Ebola can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body. There is no vaccine or cure.\n\n## To Stop The Disease From Spreading\n\nThe African nation of Sierra Leone borders Liberia. A WHO doctor working at one Ebola center there has caught Ebola. The doctor will be evacuated from the area, the WHO said Monday. The doctor was the second international health worker sent by the WHO to Sierra Leone who had become infected.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is sending U.S. military troops and equipment. The soldiers will help set up isolation units. The units will keep people with Ebola completely separate to prevent the disease from spreading.\n\nArmy Colonel Steve Warren is a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense. The troops will build a 25-bed hospital in Monrovia to care for health workers. Monrovia is the capital of Liberia.\n\nThe hospital will be turned over to the Liberian government once it has been set up. But the troops will make sure that supplies stay at the hospital. Supplies, like rubber gloves and mattresses, have been stolen from some of the hospitals. They will also help keep it running for up to 180 days.\n\nObama said the U.S. needs to keep Ebola from spreading through Africa and other parts of the world. If it spreads, \"then it could be a serious danger to the United States,\" Obama said.\n\nThere are plans for another Ebola care center. British military engineers and experts will build a center near the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. The center will have a total of 62 beds.\n\nLocal and international workers will run the center. It will include a 12-bed area for health workers who become sick.'"

Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\n\n### CON: We should not put our troops at risk\n\nWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama is using American troops to fight Ebola. It shows the world he cares enough to send our best people. But he's putting them at risk.\n\nLike many of Obama's plans, he is acting without thinking.\n\nHere are four reasons why sending our military isn't the best way to help:\n\nOur military is already doing too much. The president has decided to cut the Army from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. A government study said this makes it difficult to deal with more than one large military problem at a time.\n\n## A Dangerous Mission\n\nNow the president will send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa. And that number is sure to go up. The president just decided to call up National Guard soldiers, who are off duty. The U.S. is also now bombing the extremist group Islamic State. And our troops may need to go fight that group soon.\n\nThese are big challenges. Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno recently questioned the plan to cut the number of U.S. troops.\n\nOur troops risk getting stuck in West Africa. Besides giving humanitarian aid, our military might have to keep the peace as well.\n\nInternational affairs expert Janine Davidson said, \"As the disease spreads, so does panic - and panic leads to violence.\" Keeping the peace in African countries could be risky.\n\nFor one, it would take many more troops in the future, stretching our military even further. The World Health Organization says there could be 10,000 new Ebola cases each week by December. That could cause a lot of panic and violence. Our troops would need to keep the peace.\n\nFor another, it could place our soldiers in a position like the one Liberian soldiers recently found themselves. They had to choose between their safety and the public's. A neighborhood was put under quarantine and people were not allowed to leave their homes. Violent rioting started. It left four people wounded and one 16-year-old boy dead.\n\nImagine U.S. soldiers being forced to make the same choice: Having to shoot unarmed, possibly infected Liberians or allow Ebola to spread.\n\n## Unstable Countries\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) isn't ready. All of the Ebola patients who caught the disease on U.S. soil were health care workers. They caught Ebola while treating it and using the instructions of the CDC. The CDC is not ready to help in Africa.\n\nBringing the military into humanitarian aid risks getting the U.S. dragged into the problems inside West African countries. All three countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak have weak governments.\n\nCivil wars ended in Sierra Leone and Liberia not long ago. Guinea was ruled by the military until 2010. These countries could be so unstable that just stopping travel there from the U.S. could cause chaos.\n\n\"You isolate them, you can cause unrest in the country,\" said the National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci. \"It's conceivable that government could fall.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration still doesn't want to stop travel from West Africa. Yet, it's the one way that might give Americans some protection.\n\nOur soldiers face enormous risk. And it's all because the president is unwilling stop the flow of possibly infected people from West Africa.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: David A.

            "text": "\tCAIRO - Egypt's stormy political situation has taken a turn for the worse. Last week the elected president, Mohammed Morsi, was overthrown. On Monday, a largely peaceful protest by his supporters ended in a bloody clash. An estimated 51 people were killed after the army fired on the protest.\n\nThe president's supporters said soldiers attacked them with tear gas and gunfire around 4 a.m. Morsi's supporters have been camped outside several army buildings for days. They are demanding the release of the president, who has been under arrest.\n\nMorsi was pushed out of office by the army on Wednesday. He is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood party, which wants the Muslim religion to play a greater role in Egyptian life. Before his removal, Egypt had been struggling to maintain a fragile new democracy. Two and a half years ago Egypt's longtime dictator, President Hosni Mubarak, was overthrown by the people. Mubarak had ruled for 30 years. The military took over the country while elections were being prepared. Morsi was elected president one year ago.\n\n## Many Egyptians Were Unhappy With Morsi\n\nMany Egyptians were unhappy with Morsi's leadership, however. They complained he was giving too much power to the Brotherhood. Even after he was pushed out and arrested, his critics still rallied. The protests were similar to those that had forced out Mubarak in 2011. Morsi's enemies pointed to a stumbling economy, broken government services and widespread social problems.\n\nTens of thousands of anti-Morsi protesters gathered early Sunday evening in Cairo's famous Tahrir Square.\n\n\"We want to build the democracy that we dreamed of in 2011, not a religious state where religion is used to divide the whole population,\" said Samira Kamel, 21.\n\n## Bloodbath In The Streets\n\nBrotherhood officials reported that many people were killed and hundreds hurt during the protest. They asked supporters to donate blood and to rush to help the victims. \"Bloodbath!\" tweeted Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad Haddad.\n\nEgyptian television showed bloodied, unconscious protesters getting medical aid. There were also images of bodies lying under sheets and Egyptian flags.\n\nEgypt's military is widely respected by the Egyptian people. It thus came as a shock to many that they fired on citizens and caused so many deaths. Some feared the situation could lead to civil war.\n\n## Conflict Over Choice Of New Prime Minister\n\nAfter removing Morsi, the military named Adly Mahmoud Mansour to be temporary president. Mansour is a top Egyptian judge.\n\nEgypt's government also needs a prime minister. The military and interim president Mansour wanted a prime minister to be named quickly. They hoped to send a message that Egypt is stable. A quick choice would have boosted confidence among Egyptians and in the world. Instead, fumbling and conflict raised fresh doubts about Egypt's future.\n\nAt first, there were reports that Mohammed ElBaradei would be named. ElBaradei is a Nobel Peace Prize winner who many young protesters supported. After the ultra-religious Nour Party rejected him as too modern the government suddenly pulled back. Egyptian news reports now say that the likely choice is Ziad Bahaa El-Din.\n\nEl-Din is an attorney and former parliament member. He is seen as a compromise choice compared to ElBaradei. ElBaradei would become vice president under the latest plan, reports said.\n\nEl-Din is expected to focus on improving Egypt's money problems. He has been critical of the police. He also has blamed Morsi for failing to involve more people during his year in office.\n\nThe arguments over who should be prime minister show how hard it will be for the different anti-Morsi groups to agree on Egypt's next steps.\n\n## Unexpected Crackdown Alarms Egyptians\n\nFollowing Monday's violence various political and religious figures called for an end to clashes. \"Violence begets violence and should be strongly condemned. Independent investigation a must. Peaceful transition is only way,\" said Mohamed ElBaradei on his official Twitter account.\n\nBut the Muslim Brotherhood promised to keep fighting.\n\n\"This has never happened before in the history of the Egyptian army,\" the party wrote. \"Perhaps there are still some wise men in the army who can put a stop to this behavior.\"'"

But the military is firmly in control once again.\n\nThe evidence is everywhere.\n\nAfter President Mohammed Morsi was thrown out of power by the army, his supporters camped in protest. Their camp is gone. All that remain are ashes and military tanks stationed to control the area. Government bulldozers sit where kitchens once prepared thousands of meals. Burned-out hallways are all that are left where the injured from the sit-in camp once clung to life on dirty hospital floors.\n\nFew people talk now about democracy or creating a modern country. Few speak of elections or reforming the justice system or ending police brutality. The military is back in charge, and many Egyptians support that.\n\n## Under a State of Emergency\n\nPeople once hoped that the military would lead for a short time, then turn power over. But then came Morsi's ouster and the furious crackdown on protesters. At least 638 people were killed and another 3,000 were injured.\n\nEvents this summer showed that the military is shaping Egypt's political future. Many people prefer the military, however undemocratic, over the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is the secretive group through which Morsi rose to the presidency.\n\nThe military's hand already is playing out on the streets. Being linked to the Muslim Brotherhood now is seen almost as an act of terrorism. Much of the country is under a state of emergency. People have to be inside their homes after a certain time, which is called a curfew.\n\nSome who led the 2011 revolution support the military action.\\n## Military Targets Muslim Brotherhood\n\n\"Nobody is talking about Egypt's democratic process. They are asking, 'Is this headed toward civil war?'\" said Eric Trager, who studies the region for a Washington think tank. \"The military is in charge.\"\n\nThe military is trying to get rid of the Brotherhood, Trager said.\n\nThere were growing signs that the military was gaining control before Wednesday. More than 200 people had died in clashes with army forces before Wednesday. Most supported Morsi. The government announced that it had named 25 local governors earlier this week. Nineteen were generals.\n\nGen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi was the man who announced Morsi's removal. Then he named Adly Mansour as the president. Mansour went on to appoint a government made up mostly of generals. Or they were supporters of Hosni Mubarak, the president who was kicked out two years ago.\n\nAmong those who accepted a post was Nobel Prize winner Mohamed ElBaradei. He was the leader of the opposition when Morsi was president. Mansour named ElBaradei vice president. ElBaradei resigned Wednesday. In his resignation letter, he referred to the quarreling nature of the new government. He suggested that the people weren't in control.\\n## Bloody End To Talks\n\nLast month, weeks after Morsi supporters had set up their protest sites, el-Sissi urged Egyptians to take to the streets. He wante**d their support to go after the protesters. Millions did, then were frustrated when the sit-ins remained.**\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood and the military started negotiating to end the standoff earlier this month. Nadar Bakkar is a spokesman for the Nour Party who participated in the negotiations. Bakkar said the talks had failed in part because it was unclear who was in charge.\n\nThe current government \"is not thinking as a whole,\" Bakkar said. \"Sissi is leading.\"\n\nMore talks had been scheduled for Wednesday. The military surprised several of the negotiators by clearing the protest sites instead. Several government officials told McClatchy that they, too, had learned about it only when it began.'"

            "title": "Did NSA's spying programs uncover latest terror threat? Few seem sure",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The United States shut embassies in several Muslim countries late last week. The decision to close them was made because the government said terrorists could be planning an attack.\n\nEmbassies are where the ambassador, or official U.S. representative to a country, works. The closings are only for a few days. The government also warned travelers about the threat.\n\nThe closures quickly became part of an argument going on in Congress. Lawmakers are debating whether it is right for the government to monitor people's cellphone records and Internet use. The National Security Agency is responsible for the spying.\n\nCongressmen in favor of the collection said the latest warnings showed that it was necessary to gather the information. People who do not like the monitoring said there was no evidence linking the programs to the warnings. They also said it was not known exactly what the threat was.\n\n## Al-Qaida Message Intercepted\n\nThe debate was held across television talk shows on Sunday.\n\n\"The NSA program is proving its worth yet again,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said. He was speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff took the opposite position. The program that has caused the most concern in Congress collects information about cellphone calls people make. It was not important for detecting al-Qaida's plans in this case, he said.\n\n \"There's no indication, unless I'm proved wrong later, that that program ... contributed to information about this particular plot,\" Schiff said.\n\nThere were no reports of unusual activity Sunday in any of the countries where U.S. embassies were kept closed.\n\nThe embassies were closed and the travel warning was given because of a message between two leaders of the terror group al-Qaida, said an official who had been informed on the matter in Yemen. The U.S. was able to get its hands on the message, too.\n\nAl-Qaida's leader gave \"clear orders\" to carry out an attack, the official said. He said he could not give any details about the plot. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is based in Yemen.\n\n## Security Versus Privacy Debate\n\nEmbassies were temporarily closed in Egypt, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and more than a dozen other countries. Some were set to reopen on Monday.\n\n\"This is a good indication of why they're so important,\" Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" He was talking about the spying programs. Chambliss is the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThere are two programs that people are looking at after leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The programs operate under different parts of U.S. law.\n\nThe collection of the telephone records was authorized by a secret court. The court was set up under the Patriot Act, which was passed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n\nA second program comes under a separate law. Under that program, the NSA collects information on Internet traffic on sites like Facebook and Yahoo.\n\nSome people do not like the government looking at information about their phone calls or how they use the Internet. They think the information should be private. Others think the government should be able to check the information if it can help stop an attack.\n\n## NSA's Exact Role Unknown\n\n\"Do we need to collect all of the phone records of all of the people living in America for five years\" to be ready to target one person?  Democtratic Sen. Richard Durbin said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama told nine members of Congress he would take suggestions on how to make the NSA program more open, Durbin said.\n\nBut Graham seemed to be ready for a big fight over changing the NSA. Getting rid of the program would make the U.S. less safe, he said.\n\nThere are questions about whether either program caught the message with the threat. It is not even clear if the threat was real.\n\n\"The good news is that we picked up intelligence. That's what the NSA does,\" said Democratic congressman C.A. Dutch on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nChambliss had a similar view. \"If we did not have these programs we wouldn't be able to listen in on the bad guys,\" he said. The program to collect Internet information helped uncover the current threat, he said.\n\nJust what that help was is unknown. Officials say it's a secret.'"

            "title": "Farmers want new law to keep foreign workers in fields",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The fruits and vegetables you find in your neighborhood grocery store today are just as likely to be picked in Mexico and Brazil as in California and Florida.\n\nBut even more produce could come from outside the United States, farmers warn. That's if Congress fails to pass an immigration law to make sure there are enough workers to bring in the crops and milk the cows.\n\n\"The bottom line is people need to decide whether they'd rather import their labor or import their food,\" said Randall Patterson, a North Carolina fruit farmer.\n\n## Rotting In Fields\n\nPatterson legally employs about 140 foreign-born workers. He hires them legally and uses a system similar to the one a group of senators wants to make better.\n\nBut crops are being left to rot in fields across the country because farmers cannot find enough workers. Many workers have been arrested and sent back home. Others do not show up to work. They are afraid the same thing will happen to them.\n\nAbout seven of every 10 farm workers are thought to be working here illegally. Many Republicans and Democrats think that the farm industry is hurt by a broken immigration system. The system decides who can come work in the country.\n\n## Senate Plan\n\nA plan in the Senate would create a way for people living in the United States illegally to become citizens. That number of people is about 11 million. Farm workers could become \"legal\" quicker.\n\nThey would get special legal rights. Farm workers could also ask to live here for good after five years. They could even become U.S. citizens. But some people say that farm jobs should be held by Americans. The jobs should not go to people who broke the country's immigration laws.\n\nOne of the opponents of the Senate plan is Jeff Sessions. He is a Republican from Alabama. He thinks Americans will do farm work.\n\n\"I worked construction in the Alabama sun, hauling lumber and stuff. I know Americans do that every single day, tough work,\" he said.\n\nBut there are few U.S.-born farm workers.\n\n## Foreign Workers Needed\n\nCharles Conner, president of a farm trade group, said the country couldn't keep growing as much food as it does without foreign-born workers.\n\n\"If that labor was not available to us,\" Conner said, \"... it would mean that we would get that food from somewhere else.\"\n\nHe said 80,000 acres worth of fresh fruits and vegetables that had been grown in California are now grown outside the United States because of labor shortages. That number came from a 2008 study. Meanwhile, Americans want to know more about the food they eat. They also want it to be locally grown.\n\nA new study found that just 268 U.S.-born people in North Carolina applied for farm jobs. There are nearly 500,000 people without jobs in the state.\n\nMore than 90 of every 100 who asked were hired. But not many showed up for the first day of work. Only a handful finished the growing season.\n\n## Caps On Workers\n\nPlans in Congress have caps on the number of guest workers. The caps are limits. Once the cap is hit, no more workers could come in.\n\nThe secretary of agriculture could raise or lower the cap. The decision would be based on how much food is needed. But some growers like Patterson worry that there is a cap at all. \"How do they know after writing all that reform how many workers I'm going to need at my farm?\" he asked. \"Einstein couldn't figure that out.\"\n\nPatterson is a member of a group that uses a guest worker plan. Lee Wicker is the group's assistant director. He estimates that his members employ about 7,500 workers under the program.\n\nBut he doesn't like the idea of caps either. If the illegal workforce really is blocked, that could be a problem. Wicker worries the caps do not supply enough workers.\n\nNorth Carolina's growing season runs later than in California and more southern parts of the country. Wicker worries that his farmers could be left out if the caps are reached before the Carolina growing season gets going. They might not have anyone to bring in the crops.'"

            "title": "You don't know they're there, as these peacemakers get both sides to talk",
            "text": "\tFERGUSON, Mo. - A little more than a day after Michael Brown was killed last August, the peacemakers arrived.\n\nThey introduced themselves to police and city officials. Late that night, they met with Brown's family, in a police truck down the street from where he was killed. Brown, an unarmed black teen, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson.\n\nThe shooting set off nearly nightly protests by members of the local black community. They felt that Brown wouldn't have been killed if he had been white.\n\nThe peacemakers worked for a little-known unit of the U.S. Department of Justice called the Community Relations Service. Also called mediators, because they mediate, or help all sides reach an agreement, they were the first U.S. government officials to arrive in Ferguson.\n\n## Playing An Important Role\n\nSince then, they've held dozens of meetings with police, citizens and community leaders. Not much is known about what exactly they are doing. Which is exactly how the mediators want it.\n\nAnd yet they are playing what may be the most important role in Ferguson. They are persuading worried residents, overwhelmed city officials, angry protesters and frustrated police to sit down and talk.\n\n\"God bless them,\" said Patricia Bynes, a leader in Ferguson.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating the killing. It is also looking into whether the police has used too much force against black people and protesters in Ferguson. They are offering to train the police.\n\nThe Community Relations Service has a completely different job. The 50-person, $12 million-a-year unit does not investigate crimes or train police.\n\n## \"The Longest-Lasting Solutions\"\n\nThe goal of the unit, said Director Grande H. Lum, is to give all sides a private place to talk. The hope is that they will solve their own problems.\n\n\"Those are the longest-lasting solutions - when the people themselves resolve their own disputes,\" Lum said. His unit, he said, allows \"people to speak.\"\n\nLum said mediators are trained to understand what is really causing a problem. They are able to figure out who is involved, and who needs to be included in the meetings.\n\n\"We are going to be there,\" Lum said, \"as long as it is needed.\"\n\nThe Community Relations Service calls itself the nation's peacemaker. The unit was created as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The law outlawed unfair treatment based on race, color, sex, religion and where a person was from. Since then, Community Relations mediators have responded to problems between the races in American cities.\n\nIn 2013, an officer in Geneva, New York, shot a black man. Protesters gathered in front of the city police department.\n\nGeneva Police Chief Jeffrey E. Trickler said that mediators helped create a community agreement. \"Anything we felt we needed, they were a phone call away,\" Trickler said. \"From my eyes, things have improved.\"\n\n## Secret Key To Success\n\nIn St. Louis, the federal mediators have been in and out of the city for years.\n\nAdolphus Pruitt is the president of the St. Louis city branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He said he can't list all the times he has called a police department with a problem. Sometimes the police respond, but more often they don't, he said.\n\nBut when the unit's mediators get involved, Pruitt said, everyone is willing to talk.\n\n\"They don't like to talk to the press, and don't like to talk about what they do,\" said Rue Landau, who is with city of Philadelphia. That secrecy, Landau said, is part of the reason why the Community Relations Service is so successful.\n\n## Holding Tense Talks\n\nTwo Sundays after Michael Brown's shooting, mediator Rita Valenciano called a morning meeting of nine community leaders, and they talked for three hours. \"No breakfast. No orange juice. No nothing. Just us in a room,\" said Patricia Washington, who works for the county.\n\nThe conversation was tense, she said. Ferguson police and city officials were there, and some in the room didn't want to talk with them.\n\nHowever, before that meeting, \"nobody was talking,\" Washington said.\n\nMoreover, mediators are giving practical help. They have provided training for those who want to protect protesters and want information.\n\nThe situation is far from over. Washington said she's been trying for weeks to get the angriest protesters to come to the meetings, without any success.\n\nStill, she said, there's been progress. Now the protesters are calling her and four have promised to come to the next meeting.'"

            "text": "\tFERGUSON, Mo. - Elections held this Tuesday have brought big changes to Ferguson. Its six-member City Council will have three black members, for the first time ever.\n\nDwayne James was the council's only black member. Now he will be joined by two other African-Americans: Wesley Bell and Ella Jones.\n\nFerguson has seen a wave of protests against police and the courts. The protests began after last summer's police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Many people feel that the police and courts in Ferguson treat blacks very unfairly.\n\n## Former Mayor Wins\n\nFerguson is mostly black, but there have been very few blacks in city government. Many here feel that the police and courts will not change until more blacks are elected.\n\nTuesday's election is a step in that direction. However, it was only partly a victory for protesters, some said.\n\nVoters chose three new council members. Of those, only one was the person protesters hoped would win. Bob Hudgins and Lee Smith were supported by many who are angry about police and courts here, but both lost.\n\nHudgins was defeated by Brian Fletcher, who is white and who was once the mayor of Ferguson.\n\n\"I guess the signal was sent tonight that this old dog has a few tricks,\" Fletcher said. \"Experience isn't a bad thing. It can be a good thing.\"\n\n## A Judge Wins\n\nSmith lost to Bell.\n\nBell is African-American, but he is a judge. He is part of a court system that many think is very unfair to blacks, so protesters did not support him. Still, Bell says he wants to change the way the Ferguson police treats blacks.\n\nJones was the candidate favored by protesters in her race. She won almost half of the votes, beating the other three people in her contest.\n\nJones began her campaign long before Michael Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson. She said she ran partly because of the way she saw young black men being treated by Ferguson police.\n\nVoter Sharon Bell-Price said this year's election was \"extremely important.\"\n\n\"I'm hopeful we'll get the change we're looking for,\" she added.\n\n## \"Talking To People\"\n\nThe fact that Bell is a judge did not seem to hurt him. He managed to win election even though many here are angry at the courts.\n\nThe key to Bell's victory was talking directly to voters, said Dan Peterson, who ran Bell's campaign.\n\n\"It was knocking on doors talking to people in person,\" Peterson said. \"We talked about why Wesley was the best candidate.\"\n\nFerguson now needs to find a new chief of police. Its previous police chief, Thomas Jackson, quit after a U.S. government report said that Ferguson's police department had regularly treated blacks badly.\n\nWhoever tries out for the police chief's job \"better be doing his homework,\" Bell said.'"

            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - Typhoon Haiyan is one of the largest tropical storms ever recorded. It hit the Philippines on Nov. 7. Thousands of people died and more than 600,000 lost their homes. The full damage is not yet known. Telephone and Internet service aren't fully back up yet. It's hard to travel on some roads.\n\nAnd aid has been slow to reach victims in faraway parts of the country.\n\nCould this disaster mark a change in the way aid is given? A chance for young people to give money in their own way? A moment for the millennial generation, those born after 1982, to become leaders?\n\nDigital technology has changed the face of giving, for both aid groups and people who donate money to help out. More people now give digitally through text messaging, Facebook and websites. The quickest way to send $10 is by text message. You can send the World Food Programme $10 by simply texting the word AID to a five-digit number. The word to send money to the Salvation Army is TYPHOON.\n\n## Aid Requests On The Web\n\nThe Web is ready to accept people's donations. Google \"Philippines\" and \"aid,\" and about a dozen aid group websites pop up above and to the right of your search results. You'll see ads from the International Rescue Committee and Doctors Without Borders.\n\nIf you've visited Facebook this week, you've seen an ad for \"Emergency Relief Donation.\" It says: \"This donation to the American Red Cross will help those affected by the typhoon in the Philippines.\"\n\nApple even has created a way to give money through the iTunes store.\n\nThat makes it quick and easy to give. \"It's about the closest you can come,\" says Derrick Feldmann, who advises aid groups, \"to one-click giving.\"\n\nThat makes it perfect for millennials. They move around a lot and are often on their smart phones and tablets. Digital giving has increased in popularity. The Pew Research Center is a group that surveys people about big things happening in the U.S. Its 2011 survey found that people under 40 were just as likely to give money digitally as over the phone or through the mail.\n\n## Helping Haiti And Japan\n\nMillennials gave money during the Haiti earthquake of 2010. And they gave big again during the Japanese tsunami disaster of 2011 which caused giant waves of water that wrecked many towns. Large numbers responded to the call for aid. It helped that celebrities such as will.i.am, Sean Penn and Shakira asked people to give money. Three-quarters of all the people who gave to Haiti relief were younger than 50, said a Pew survey.\n\nFeldmann says that the Haiti relief worked because the coverage on TV and the Internet showed how bad the disaster was. And millennials were ready to act.\n\nCan the suffering in the Philippines be brought alive like that?\n\nFeldmann says millennials give money based on their feelings. \"They see something on TV, the Web, their mobile device, and they decide to text some money,\" he said.\n\nBut they are very sharp, he adds. \"They know exactly what digital tools to use, to find out more about the cause and 'where my money is going.'\" Then they give money.\n\n## Instant Images Of Disasters\n\nA 2012 survey of millennials asked 6,522 people ages 20 to 35 about their giving patterns. Three-quarters said they had donated to a charitable cause in the last year, and almost two-thirds said they had volunteered. They tended to give $100 or less each time. Older groups give more. But younger people give more quickly.\n\nMillennials say they like to give locally. But, the numbers show that they give to many causes in other countries. Part of this is that YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are global. Human suffering is all over the world, and now it can be brought very close.\n\nAaron Smith works for the Pew Research Center's Internet Project. He says millennials decide to give based on photos, videos and calls to action on TV - and their network of friends.\n\n\"We now experience information within a network, either of people we listen to or of the Web,\" Smith says. \"We expect it to be instant. We expect to see it, not just read about it.\"\n\nAnd most of the time, we can.'"

He looks like the original geek.\n\nThe former presidential candidate has a large electronic footprint on the Internet and social media. But it turns out that Nader, who just turned 80, is so last century.\n\nHis latest book, \"Unstoppable,\" will soon be out, and like his previous 11 it was typed on a bulky manual typewriter. He doesn't have a cellphone. \"Why should I have a cellphone? I have people I don't want to get phone calls from,\" he says. And his Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and email accounts are written by people working for him, under strict guidelines.\n\n\"I've never seen them,\" he said of his Internet accounts.\n\n## Some Are \"Digitally Resistant\"\n\nNader is one of a small group of Americans who are \"digitally resistant.\" They avoid using electronic devices. That means no Internet and no smartphones. But there's another new group that's also turning to old technology. Some tech users are distrustful of the amount of electronic spying revealed by Edward Snowden who used to work for the National Security Agency.\n\n\"After Snowden, how comfortable can anyone be putting their (whole) life online,\" asked Warren Sack. \"Or even on their own computer?\" Sack is a software designer and professor.\n\nThe Pew Research Center took a poll last month to mark the 25th birthday of the World Wide Web. It found that 81 percent of U.S. adults use laptop and desktop computers at home, work, school or someplace else. The January poll of 1,006 Americans also found that 90 percent of all U.S. adults have cellphones. More than half of these are smartphones. In the 18-29 age group, 98 percent have cellphones. And 83 percent of them are smartphones.\n\nThe Pew Research Center's Internet project found that 87 percent of U.S. adults use the Internet at least occasionally. And 71 percent use it every day.\n\n\"This is a significant increase from the year 2000, our first measure. Just 29 percent of all adults said they went online on a typical day,\" according to Pew.\n\n## Typewriters, Vinyl Records Are \"Vintage\"\n\nIn many ways, Jamie Patterson and Matthew Chojnacki are typical millennials. The young married couple in their 20s grew up on the Internet and live a city life in Toronto.\n\n\"I was very much ingrained in the digital culture,\" said Chojnacki.\n\nBut after stumbling onto a sort of yard sale one day, Chojnacki bought several typewriters and started fixing them up. Pretty soon, he and Patterson had a business. They buy, restore and sell typewriters. Of course, they use a website, OldFortTypewriterCo.com.\n\nThey would lug the typewriters to a weekly \"vintage night\" at a local bar. Some people would type. Others would knit. A disc jockey would play vinyl records.\n\nJeff Hendrie is an 18-year-old high school senior in Detroit. He does just about everything the old-fashioned way. He lugs a typewriter to school every day. He uses a flip phone and considers the U.S. mail \"the most secure system.\" He has an email account, but only because he has to. He is not on social media. Teachers who usually send students their assignments by text will give them to him in person instead.\n\n\"I was born in the wrong era,\" Hendrie said.\n\n## Old Phones \"Are Very Beautiful\"\n\nLynne Joyrich is a professor of modern culture and media. But she still likes to use mid-20th-century devices. She has a collection of phones with circular dials.\n\n\"I keep them because they are very beautiful,\" she said of her collection of old phones. Several work.\n\nShe has a smartphone to keep in touch with students. But she often forgets she has it, \"for the pleasure of being able to be left alone.\" The ability to control whom you are in contact with matters more and more.\n\nNew York City-based Laura Pitter, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group, said: \"I'm much more careful about what I do online. I talk in person more now.\"\n\nShe worries about foreign governments watching people. So do other people who look at human rights.\n\n\"People are keeping things in notebooks,\" she said. \"Even the most savvy people who work in this area find it's very difficult to protect yourself.\"'"

            "text": "\tHACKENSACK, N.J. - This holiday season, the hottest present is a high-tech gadget. It's not a video game, tablet or smartphone. It's a drone.\n\nA drone is a small flying aircraft, often with a camera attached.\n\nThe newspaper USA Today called the DJI Phantom 2 Vision drone a top holiday gift for 2014. The Phantom 2 Vision has four propellors and a high-quality camera. It sells for $1,200.\n\nThere's even a drone cheaper than $100. Radioshack is selling its Surveyor Drone for just $60 this holiday season. The Surveyor is red, it's easy to fly and it shoots video.\n\n## Having Fun With Drones\n\nRob Powley of Mahwah, New Jersey, has a lot of drones. He has so many that he's lost count. Some he bought already made. Others he built himself.\n\n\"I bought them because they're cool,\" Powley said. \"It's amazing what you can do with a drone. And they're getting better all the time.\"\n\nFor years, drones were used by the military for secret missions. They gathered information and dropped bombs.\n\nNow, the average person can afford a drone and more and more are appearing in the skies.\n\nBut more drones buzzing around also has brought more problems. Airplane pilots in the sky and tourists in national parks have seen them hovering close by.\n\n## Be Safe, Respect Privacy\n\nThe two major worries with drones are safety and privacy. To deal with the worries, many new laws are being made.\n\n\"It's confusing,\" said Wells C. Bennett, who studies drones at the Brookings Institution. \"A lot of the laws will change over the next couple of years.\"\n\nFive years ago, drones were hard to get and too expensive for most people, said Mike Blades. He watches the drone business.\n\nSince then, sales of drones have skyrocketed. Blades thinks that next year people will buy 2.4 million drones. It would be double as many sold in 2014.\n\nRemote-controlled airplanes and helicopters have been around for a long time. Drones are different, though. They are easier to fly and can be flown in small spaces. In fact, Powley flies his own drones around his house and office.\n\n\"You can fly with first-person video, so it looks like you're inside it. That's really cool,\" he said.\n\n## Low Battery? Dropping Drone\n\nMilitary drones were designed for stealth: to be as quiet as possible. The drones sold in stores are not stealthy, though. Most of them buzz like a hive full of angry bees.\n\nDrones run on batteries. If the battery runs out, the drone may fall out of the sky like a stone.\n\nStill, drone technology is improving rapidly. Soon, drones will use lighter equipment and better batteries. They will fly higher, farther and faster than any today.\n\nMore drones in the sky has also brought up more concerns about privacy and safety.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) is in charge of the nation's skies. This year, the FAA, which also runs airports in the U.S., has heard about more and more problems with drones. Since July, the agency has received 30 complaints a month from pilots.\n\n## Stay Away From Airports\n\nOn Sept. 8, for example, the pilots of three different passenger jets reported \"a very close call\" with a drone at about 1,900 feet as they flew into La Guardia Airport in New York City.\n\nEven a small drone could bring down a jet.\n\nOthers worry that drones could be used to invade people's privacy - to spy on them.\n\nIn Lower Township, New Jersey, Russell Percenti used a shotgun to bring down a drone that a neighbor was flying over his house. He was arrested.\n\n## Don't Spy On Neighbors\n\nSmall drones with high-quality cameras make it easy to spy on your neighbors, even if they have a high fence, said Jeramie Scott of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\n\nDrone supporters say people shouldn't be so concerned about drones and privacy. A good pair of binoculars is a better spying tool than a drone, said Michael Drobac. He works for a group that represents drone makers.\n\nDrones can only fly for a short time, he said, and they make a very loud buzzing noise, so people can hear them if they are near.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Drone aircraft were not just firing missiles in Yemen last week. The unmanned craft were also on display in a convention hall less than a mile from the White House.\n\nIt showed that unarmed [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) are coming to America's skies soon.\n\nThere were all kinds of unmanned aircraft packing the huge Washington Convention Center. They ranged from bird-sized craft to a scale model of a giant Air Force MQ-9 Reaper, known as a hunter-killer drone. The drones and other gadgets being shown have both government and private uses. Organizers called it the largest drone show in the world.\n\nThe three-day show featured nearly 600 exhibits. Companies were there to demonstrate how drones can help in all sorts of things. Law enforcement, search and rescue, selling real estate and checking pipelines were all covered. So were fighting forest fires and protecting wildlife.\n\n## Fear Of Flying Drones\n\nBut first the industry has to ease the public's fear of drones.\n\nMost of the companies won't even use the word. They prefer names like unmanned aerial vehicle or remotely piloted aircraft. When people hear the word drones, they think of deadly strikes by the U.S. against suspected terrorists from Pakistan to North Africa. Companies want to avoid that image.\n\nSome Americans also worry about something flying overhead and spying on them.\n\n\"Obviously the public is concerned,\" said David Ison. He is an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nIn the giant convention hall, sensors scanned people's body heat invisibly. Convention goers could operate simulators. These machines let them pretend they were flying drones  over the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some states promoted places to test drones. Colorful banners from big companies hung from the ceiling. Dull gray models of unmanned aircraft hung next to them.\n\n## Stored In A Backpack\n\nDrones for business are supposed to be flying over the country by September 2015. Experts estimate that 10,000 unmanned aircraft could be flying five years later. Big and small companies want to sell low-cost portable aircraft. There might be a lot of money to be made.\n\n\"This is a growth industry,\" said conference spokeswoman Melanie Hinton.\n\nDrone technology is developing quickly. In fact, so quickly that aerospace company Aurora Flight Sciences showed off a craft that did not cost that much. It could be used in firefights, forest fires or other tasks where it might be ruined. It's made of plastic foam. Magnets attach propellers and a camera to a two-foot wingspan that can be folded and stored in a backpack.\n\nIRcameras builds video cameras that can \"see\" heat. Jeff Leake, who works for the company, pointed out footprints on a screen from people walking past.\n\n\"You can see the heat from their feet left on the floor,\" Leake said. The camera can pick up a temperature change of less than 1 degree Fahrenheit, he explained.\n\nRichard Becker spun a computer ball in the booth for Corsair Engineering and hit a button. The screen showed a small, gray drone flying over a rocky valley in Afghanistan. A thin column of smoke could be seen at the end of a box canyon. \"All this is exactly as you would see in real life,\" he said.\n\n## Simulator For Drone Flight\n\nThe machine is used to teach soldiers how to fly the ScanEagle. The craft is a drone used by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. Its wings stretch 10 feet. Indiana State University and the University of North Dakota have purchased simulators, for about $65,000 each. They will be used to teach aviation students about drone operations, Becker said.\n\nPanels at the conference discussed challenges facing the industry. Those include shrinking defense spending and possible legal suits if fleets of drones start flying over America.\n\nLt. Gen. James Barclay recalled how the Army initially did not want to even conduct research about using drones.\n\n\"I can remember back to early on in Army aviation, we said, 'Unmanned systems, no way; it's got to have a man in it,'\" Barclay said. \"Everyone was scared that ... at the end of the day, everything would become unmanned, and it would do away with our jobs and stuff.\"\n\nHe added, \"But I will tell you that that's not the case. We know that it will bring better capabilities to our force. And that is the future of our Army.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - Women have a big say in the purchase of most cars in the United States.\n\nYet, fewer than 1 in 5 car engineers are women, according to Lindsay Brooke, author of the report \"Women in Vehicle Engineering.\" Also, just one woman is in charge of a major automobile company. Mary Barra was named head of General Motors in 2014.\n\nThe majority of people working in the car industry are men.\n\nThis fact may explain why more than half of the women around the world are unhappy with the cars on the market, says Brandy Schaffels. She is the chief editor of AskPatty.com, an automotive advice website geared to women. Men are designing cars for men, not women. Women want more places to store things, and nicer lighting and materials. They also want cars designed for their smaller body size, Schaffels said.\n\nCar designers and engineers are jobs in great demand, particularly for women designers and engineers. They are needed to work on car design, lighting, technology and car development, Brooke said.\n\nThree women car engineers are making a difference in the car world. They are role models for young women interested in a career in the car industry.\n\n## Encouraging Younger Women\n\nThe first engineer is Dawn Piechocki. She is engineering manager for the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator at Ford Motor Company. She is involved in the design and engineering of the chassis, the vehicle's frame. She also works on the vehicle's engine, body and electrical parts.\n\nPiechocki travels between two offices. One is in Dearborn, Michigan, the birthplace of the American car industry. The other is in Mexico City. In Mexico, she is the only woman in engineering management, and 55 people report to her. \"When I came here I was unsure about how I would be viewed,\" Piechocki said. She did not know whether the men would accept a woman as their boss. \"I've been accepted very well.\"\n\nPiechocki also tests vehicles around the world. She has tested cars in the deserts of Borrego, California, and Dubai in the Middle East. She also test-drove cars on long distance drives from Mexico City at 7,500 feet to Acapulco at sea level.\n\nShe also speaks to younger women who are interested in science and math. \"And I have found a lot of women, especially younger women, are just (scared) by vehicles,\" she said. \"But I explain that the automotive field is huge.\" There are many areas where women can make a difference.\n\n## \"I Can Be A Decision-Maker\"\n\nThe second auto engineer is Elizabeth Krear, who works for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. As chief engineer of the Ram 1500 truck, she oversees all budgets, planning, engineering, development and quality.\n\n\"As an engineer, I can be a decision-maker,\" says Krear, who has a husband and two kids.\n\nKrear says she was not quite sure what to study after high school. When her dad asked her what she wanted to be, she said a businesswoman. \"He told me to go get an engineering degree. It was great advice,\" she says.\n\n\"Engineering training is basically problem solving,\" Krear says. \"It has so many business elements as well.\" She tells girls \"that if you are good at math and interested in how things work, then engineering is a great field.\"\n\n## 3-D Car Designing\n\nThe third female engineer is Elizabeth Baron. She uses virtual reality to design cars at Ford.\n\nBaron invented a new technology that uses 3-D imaging. It lets engineers analyze how a car works before it is even built. Last fall, she won Ford's highest technical award.\n\nBaron helps advise women students at the University of Michigan for Women in Science and Engineering. She also exchanges ideas with NASA, the U.S. space agency, Disney and DreamWorks Animation. With Disney, she might share ideas that result in better cars for Ford and better theme parks for Disney.\n\n\"I am the only woman on my team,\" Baron said. She is involved in two fields where most workers are men - engineering and computer graphics programming. But, she says, \"Thankfully we respect each other, and that's what is important.\"'"

            "text": "\t###PRO: A ban won't work\n\nLAS VEGAS - Preventing people from gambling won't work. In the 1920s, the sale of alcohol was banned by the government. It was called Prohibition. Many businesses were forced to go under because of it. And it led to severe side effects.\n\nThe effects included bad, criminal behavior. People illegally made and sold booze. The government spent years trying to stop it. It cost a lot of public money. In the end, the government canceled Prohibition.\n\nLet's not make the same mistake twice. Americans enjoy entertainment, especially gambling. Gambling is part of American history. Since our nation's founding, it's existed in some form or another.\n\nWe just need to protect against the problems gambling can bring. Let's take the rules that work at casinos and use them for online gaming.\n\n## Online Gambling Is Here\n\nIt would be silly to think blocking gambling would stop Americans from getting into online gaming. It would happen anyway. All it would do is cost police money to deal with it. And millions of average American citizens would be turned into criminals.\n\nThe black market exists already. Today's gambling websites are unregulated. There are no rules and they don't have to pay taxes. It is illegal. But, most online casinos are in other countries, so they get away with it.\n\nUnregulated online gaming is exploding: an estimated 1 million Americans are involved. In total, they spend nearly $3 billion annually on overseas gaming websites. Most of these Americans aren't criminals; they're simply looking to get into the newest form of gaming - online.\n\nThe U.S. shouldn't demonize or ignore it. Moreover, the money from this new form of gaming technology could pay for services Americans need. The money can be put toward covering the costs of education, for instance. And it could pay for dealing with the problems that sometimes come from gambling.\n\nModern technologies used in online gaming are there to protect Americans. They can prevent young people and problem gamblers from betting. And these safeguards are being tested in states such as New Jersey that allow for online gaming within its state borders. These technologies, while not perfect, will continue to improve.\n\nStates and casino operators may not even want that much online gambling. Many will likely limit online gaming to competitive poker only.\n\nIt's no secret that many state and city governments desperately need money. Online gaming holds the potential to help cities and states get the money they need.\n\n## Look At Lotteries\n\nState lotteries are a perfect example of using entertainment to raise money for good purposes. Large numbers of states now offer online lotteries. They would also be endangered by government prohibition.\n\nThe slippery slope of a possible ban doesn't stop at the state level. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association was recently warned that popular sports fantasy leagues could be banned by this legislation as well.\n\nFantasy sports teams are created by choosing your favorite players from a sport like baseball and creating a made-up \"team.\" Fantasy football is very popular. When the people who make the fantasy teams bet money that their players will score the most points, it is considered gambling.\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if other forms of popular online gaming were prohibited by the government too. Facebook and other social media feature games that might be regulated.\n\nAmericans are well known for their ability to start businesses from scratch. Innovators like Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and others are as tied to American history as U.S. presidents.\n\nLet's not let the government hold back new technology. Other countries around the world are already doing it. We need to keep up.\n\nPretending that progress, new ideas and the Internet don't or shouldn't exist is pointless. America should look back at our past mistakes. And we should look at how we've been inspired in the past. They will show us how to handle the challenges and opportunities that come from Internet gaming today.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER:\\n> Mark Lipparelli is the founder of Gioco Ventures and former chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.

McClatchy-Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of McClatchy-Tribune or Newsela.\n\n### CON: Gambling hurts too many people\n\nWASHINGTON - Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are now allowed to operate online gambling websites. It's good news for them. Casinos in those cities don't make money like they used to. For seven straight years they've made less and less. The University of Nevada studied what would happen if this continues and found that casinos would have to double their online gambling to make up for lost money at their casinos.\n\nIt's no surprise then that states like Nevada and New Jersey want to increase online gambling. Both states rely on the money gambling brings in. It pays for the services the states provide, such as education.\n\nOnline gambling became possible in 2011. An old law used to not allow it. But, then the government decided that only Internet betting on sports had to be blocked.\n\nBe careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.\n\n## Too Easy To Gamble Too Much\n\nCongress set up a group to study the effects of gambling. In 1999, the group recommended there be no new casinos. It also told the government to block Internet gambling entirely. It said more studies were needed on the harms and benefits of online gambling. But this has not happened yet.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of online gambling are asking the government for more. They want permission to spread online gambling nationwide.\n\nOnline gambling will make it easier to gamble anytime. An increase in gambling leads to more problem gambling. Some people can't control their gambling and get into trouble. The problems with gambling have been well documented. Too much gambling leads to people running out of money, destroyed marriages, and jail.\n\nPromoters of online gambling say there aren't many problem gamblers. They say they make up only a small number of overall players. But, the numbers don't show how problem gamblers affect others. Studies show that a problem gambler affects five to 10 other people.\n\nProblem gamblers may be able to quit gambling. Even then, the damage may not be fixed. Gamblers can lose enormous amounts of money. Their problem can destroy relationships. Marriages can be torn apart. Couples may separate or divorce because of gambling.\n\nThe cost to society from gambling is huge. It's so big it can't be known. Gambling leads to an increase in crime and money problems. Lost jobs and broken families damage our society. Baylor University professor Earl L. Grinols calculates that the cost of gambling probably outweighs its benefits by 3-to-1.\n\n## End Internet Gambling\n\nInternet gambling is particularly worrisome. Problem gambling is more common online than in casinos. In fact, it's three to four times more likely.\n\nOnline gambling is more dangerous than other forms of gambling. People can play all of the time and games go quickly. People play games alone - and play several games at once. People can lose more money than they have.\n\nOnline gambling companies claim they can stop young people from gambling online. They say they can screen people by age.\n\nHowever, the FBI has countered this claim. In 2009 it wrote a letter to Congress. The letter stated that online gambling sites \"are more than likely relying on credit card information\" to gather this information. That information could be faked.\n\nLegalizing online gambling may seem like the answer to a state's money problems. Evidence, however, suggests the opposite. Gambling hurts the poor more than the rich. And it takes money away from local businesses.\n\nStates can't be allowed to set their own online gambling rules. Congress needs to aid families and communities. It should end Internet gambling.\n\n---\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER:\\n> Nick Frase is a government affairs research assistant at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian organization. \\n> \\n> This essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

            "text": "\tDOS PALOS, Calif. - Google recently sent a giant, plastic helium balloon into the air. It looked like a flying jellyfish.\n\nIt shot into the sky and soared thousands of feet. Its cargo was high-tech radio gear, computer equipment and solar panels.\n\nThe launch on July 26 was part a strange experiment by Google. You probably know the company for its Internet search engine. But it is also searching for ways to get the Internet to parts of the world without service.\n\n\"This is a great, big, hard problem,\" said Richard DeVaul. He is a Google engineer in charge of the design for the company's Project Loon. The company gave it that name because even Google knows the idea sounds a little crazy.\\n## Idea Seems Off The Wall\n\nBut Google did a test in New Zealand earlier this year. Now DeVaul says a network of low-cost, high-flying balloons could work. The balloons could carry enough wireless equipment to beam Internet connections to countrysides in parts of Africa, Asia and other poor areas.\n\nNow come more tests in California's Central Valley. The goal is to work out the answers to a bunch of questions to make the project work.\n\nFriday's launch was at an airfield that's mainly used by crop-dusting planes. More tests are planned this summer in the same area.\n\n\"Our main challenge right now is power,\" said Sameera Ponda. She is an aerospace engineer on the project. Ponda explained that the Loon team needs more information to decide how to place the solar panels and batteries. They have to keep a balloon's radio equipment and computers running for weeks at a time, even at night. And the equipment has to work 12 miles or more above the Earth, where it is ice cold.\n\nProject Loon is part of Google's secretive X division. It works on ideas that seem off the wall but could have a lot of success. Other projects include Google's self-driving car and the wearable computing device called Google Glass. The division is overseen by company co-founder Sergey Brin.\\n## A Big Math Challenge\n\nGoogle has been working on Loon for nearly two years. It only recently went public with the idea.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide Internet service to people in areas that can't afford\" usual Internet lines or towers,  Ponda explained. The company hopes to get it done \"in a few years\" she said.\n\nThe idea calls for hundreds or even thousands of balloons that will float twice as high as most jetliners fly, in a circle around the Earth. It may sound simple. But it is more difficult than it seems.\n\nThe balloons drift with the wind. So Google engineers came up with a system to raise or lower them in order to catch the air currents needed to keep them floating just the right distance from each other. They also need to stay in line so if one floats out of range from Internet users, another will come along and take its place.\n\nControlling the balloons is a huge math challenge, DeVaul said. Fortunately, \"at Google we've got a bunch of really clever computer scientists and a lot of computing power.\" Of course, it makes sense for Google to get more people on the Internet. The multibillion-dollar tech giant makes most of its money by showing ads to people who use Google's online services.\\n## Below The Digital Divide\n\nBut Project Loon is addressing \"a very real problem,\" said Richard Bennett. He is an expert on broadband networking and society. Two-thirds of the world cannot get to the Internet regularly, he said. They are considered below \"the digital divide.\"\n\nThe idea could work, Bennett said. But who will pay for the balloon network? Google has been vague about its plans. Bennett said Google may be hoping that cellphone providers and other companies will adopt the idea if Google can show it is a money-maker.\n\nBack in the Central Valley, the Google team got the balloon up in the air. Project launch commander Bill Rogers and other members of his crew loaded their trucks to track its radio signal. This balloon was designed to travel only about 150 miles before returning to the ground.\n\nRogers planned to recover it.  But in case someone else found it first, the plastic foam box holding its electronic gear carried a label that read: \"Harmless Science Experiment.\" Another provided a phone number to call.'"

            "text": "\tGoogle is getting into the car business. The technology company is hoping its new self-driving cars will turn drivers into passengers.\n\nGoogle said on Tuesday that it plans to test about 200 of its own self-driving cars.\n\n\"We've been working toward the goal of vehicles that can shoulder the entire burden of driving,\" Google wrote on its blog. \"They will take you where you want to go at the push of a button.\"\n\nGoogle's main goal is not to be a carmaker, like General Motors or Toyota. Instead, it wants to develop self-driving technology. The company said that its self-driving software will \"improve road safety and help people who can't drive.\"\n\n## Buckle Up For The Ride\n\nThe testing program will start later this summer. A handful of self-driving cars will hit the roads around Google's California offices. The test cars will have manual controls. That way test drivers can take over if something goes wrong.\n\nBut Google plans to build most of the cars as fully self-driving. That means no steering wheel, no gas or brake pedal.\n\nInside the car will be two seats with seat belts and space for belongings. There will also be a screen showing where the car is going and buttons to start and stop.\n\nThe cars were built with safety in mind. They have sensors that get rid of blind spots and look in every direction for more than 200 yards. The top speed of the first cars will be only 25 miles per hour (mph).\n\n## Smart Technology Behind The Wheel\n\n\"We're going to learn a lot from this experience,\" Google said. \"If the technology develops as we hope, we'll work with partners to bring this technology into the world safely.\"\n\nThe small electric cars were built in Michigan. Google used parts from suppliers to major car brands. The electronics and software to control them were assembled in Silicon Valley.\n\nMany of the largest automakers will probably now work faster on their own self-driving cars. These big car companies are also likely to be working on their own software. But smaller brands like Subaru or Jaguar/Land Rover could look to use Google's software for their cars.\n\nChange may happen faster than people think. Many automakers expect they will have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020. By 2025, as many as 230,000 of these self-drivers could be sold each year around the world. And that number could rise to 11.8 million 10 years later, a study found.\n\n## Laws Are Not Quite Caught Up Yet\n\nThere could also be fewer accidents as self-driving cars become more common. That's because most of today's crashes are caused by people making mistakes, the study found.\n\nIn addition, Google's cars could help people who can't drive because of their age, disability or lack of money. Cities could have self-driving car-share programs. Users could take the cars when they need them for short trips around town.\n\nBut there are two key hurdles for self-driving cars: cost and laws.\n\nSelf-driving cars could at first cost thousands of dollars more than traditional cars.\n\nAnd U.S. laws have a lot of catching up to do. Currently only four states allow self-driving vehicles on public roads: California, Nevada, Michigan and Florida. In those states, a licensed, sober driver must be in the driver's seat at all times. That driver has to be ready and willing to take control of the car.\n\nGoogle's own car hopes to help the laws catch up to the technology.\n\n\"Just imagine: You can take a trip downtown at lunchtime without a 20-minute buffer to find parking,\" Google's blog said. \"Seniors can keep their freedom even if they can't keep their car keys. And drunk and distracted driving? History.\"'"

            "text": "\tSAN FRANCISCO - David Hockney is Britain's most famous living artist. These days, he is pioneering in the art world again: He is using his index finger like a paintbrush to create colorful pictures on his iPad's touch screen.\n\n\"It's a very new medium,\" said Hockney. So new, in fact, he wasn't sure at first what he was creating. Then a few years ago he began printing his digital images. \"I was pretty amazed by them actually,\" he said, laughing. \"I'm still amazed.\"\n\nA new exhibit of Hockney's work opened Saturday in San Francisco's de Young Museum. It includes many of his iPad pictures.\n\nThe show is billed as the museum's largest ever. It fills two floors of the de Young with a survey of works from 1999 to the present. There are watercolors, charcoal sketches and even videos. But it was the iPad pieces that drew gasps. And especially the 12-foot-high majestic views of Yosemite National Park.\n\n## Veiled In Heavy Mist\n\nYosemite has already been captured by famed photographer Ansel Adams. And it has been painted by such well-known artists as Thomas Hill and Albert Bierstadt. This makes Hockney's iPad images of its rocks, rivers and trees seem comfortingly familiar. But they are also entirely new.\n\nIn one picture, scrubby, bright green pines sparkle in sunlight. Behind them, Bridalveil Fall tumbles lightly down a cliff. In the background, the distinct granite crest of Half Dome looms.\n\nIn another piece, giant sequoia trees are veiled in a heavy mist.\n\n\"He has such command of space, atmosphere and light,\" said museum director Colin Bailey.\n\nOther iPad images are overlaid, so viewers can see the different stages of a drawing. He tackles faces and flowers, and everyday objects: a human foot, scissors, an electric plug.\n\nSome of the iPad drawings are displayed on digital screens. Others, like the Yosemite works, were printed on large panels.\n\n## Thumbing Through iPad App\n\nHockney's new exhibit may help make the idea of digital artwork more accepted. Currently, computer-tablet art shows are rare.\n\n\"I'm grateful he's doing this because it opens people's mind to the technology in a new way,\" said art historian Maureen Nappi.\n\nBut Nappi isn't so sure about iPad art itself. Yes, using iPads to make art is new, she says. But there's nothing new about painting with your fingers.\n\n\"These gestures are as old as humans are,\" she said. \"Go back to cave paintings, they're using finger movements.\"\n\nHockney, 76, started drawing on his iPhone with his thumb about five years ago. Soon, he began emailing his works to dozens of friends at a time.\n\n\"People from the village come up and tease me: 'We hear you've started drawing on your telephone.' And I tell them, 'Well, no, actually, it's just that occasionally I speak on my sketch pad,'\" he said.\n\nHockney creates his work with an app called Brushes. This was built by former Apple software engineer Steve Sprang. Along with dozens of other programs, the app is being snapped up by artists.\n\n## New Ways Of Creating Art\n\nTogether, the artists are developing new methods, with Hockney in the lead.\n\n\"David Hockney is one of the living masters of oil painting,\" said art historian Kevin Hatch. But oil painting is a \"nearly 600-year-old technology,\" with its own problems and limitations. So Hockney has \"thought long and hard about the advantages of painting with a digital device like the iPad.\"\n\nHatch said artists first became interested in digital art about 25 years ago. The Internet was just in its infancy. Today, he said, most artists use a device in some way as they create art.\n\nA similar shift happened almost 100 years ago with the dawn of photography, he said. At that time, new inventions such as small photograph cards and the stereoscope captured the art world's imagination.\n\nBut there are some drawbacks to the shift to tablet art, Hatch added.\n\n\"A certain almost magical quality of oil paint,\" its look and feel, is lost when a painting becomes \"a piece of code\" on a screen, he said.\n\nIn any case Hockney isn't giving up painting or drawing any time soon. Nor does he plan on giving up tablets. When asked where he sees the art world going, he shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I don't know where it's going, really, who does?\" he said. \"But art will be there.\"'"

And he took a sophomore-level course by MIT professor Anant Agarwal called \"Circuits and Electronics.\" He got a 91 for that one.\n\nTo improve his math skills, he took a course called \"Numerical Analysis.\" It was offered online by a college in Switzerland. The class was conducted in French.\n\n## New World Of Online Learning\n\nSo-called massive open online courses, or MOOCs, are creating disagreement at universities in the United States. Some call them the future of higher education. Others think they will bring about its downfall.\n\nA few superstar professors are doing well in the new world of MOOCs: They pull in upward of 10,000 students from around the globe. And these classes are free, or nearly free.\n\nBut others see the courses as dangerous. They worry that MOOCs will greatly lower the number of teachers hired. And they fear that classroom discussion will become a thing of the past.\n\nBut what people on both sides of the argument often forget is the effect MOOCs are having in distant countries around the globe. They have certainly been a big plus for Roosemberth, according to his father, Dr. Roberto Palacios.\n\n\"At school, he hardly studies. He just shows up and takes the exams.\" But it isn't that he's lazy, Roberto added. \"He wants to learn.\"\n\nIt's just, Roosemberth explained, that \"I don't like simple things.\"\n\nThat was easy to see minutes after arriving at the family's apartment. There, the teenager showed off his workbench. On it were circuit boards he has been soldering, and his own designs for an unmanned helicopter.\n\n## Seeking Challenging Course Work\n\nBecause of his knack for acing tests, Roosemberth was selected more than a year ago to take part in a gifted students program at the University of El Salvador. It is located in the capital, San Salvador, 20 miles to the east of his town. It was there he heard a talk by engineering professor Carlos Martinez, who is strongly in favor of students taking online courses.\n\nThe teenager signed up for the \"Circuits and Electronics\" course offered by MIT. He had to go to an Internet cafe a block from his home to listen to some of the courses.\n\n\"Sometimes I had to stay up very late. I'd tell myself, 'It's worth losing a little sleep over,'\" he said. And Roosemberth was excited by the courses.\n\n\"They've been really worthwhile because I'm learning things I don't learn in school, and that I don't think they even teach in the university here,\" he said. \"For instance, we don't learn artificial intelligence here. We don't have labs for it.\"\n\nIndeed, reaching undiscovered bright students in poorer countries is one of the biggest benefits of online learning.\n\n\"Intelligence and ability are distributed equally around the globe,\" said Armando Fox, a computer scientist who is studying online courses. \"It's in everyone's best interest to find and cultivate that talent.\"\n\n## Signing Up For More Online Classes\n\nOnline courses increasingly are offered in different languages, including Spanish, French and Chinese. And technology makes it easier to follow lectures given in English. Most lectures have subtitles, and a Google translating tool can also be used.\n\nWord of the online courses also has spread to students outside of the sciences and engineering.\n\nNahiely Mendoza, 24, graduated with a law degree in December. She said she grew excited after looking over the online listings.\n\n\"I wanted to take 'Intellectual Property,' but I got in too late. So I signed up for 'Justice' by Professor Michael Sandel,\" Mendoza said. Sandel is a hugely popular Harvard professor.\n\n\"I felt it was much harder than our university courses,\" Mendoza said. \"I was used to classes that were more controlled by the professor.\" But the online course had study groups with people from all over the world. She was soon hooked and has just signed up for two more classes.\n\n\"I'm entertained by studying,\" Mendoza said.'"

            "text": "\tEdward Avila launched his first business startup a few years ago. He had already worked in California's Silicon Valley technology industry for years. But as he went to events to meet people, something disturbed him.\n\nHundreds of people were trying to start businesses. But, \"I felt like I was the only Latino in the room,\" he said.\n\nHe's not far off: Less than 1 percent of venture-backed startups have a Latino co-founder, according to a company that follows the startup business. Venture capital is the early money from investors that can get a new business going.\n\nThe lack of Latino startup founders is especially bad to see in the center of the technology industry. One-quarter of Silicon Valley's population is Hispanic.\n\n## Google And J-Lo Are Helping Hands\n\nThe experience led him to start another another business. It will help new Latino technology businesses get off the ground. His business is known as an \"incubator.\"\n\nThe incubator is ready to debut. \"Class\" begins this week for the first seven startups. But it already has some big name supporters of its own. Google and singer and actress Jennifer Lopez are helping out.\n\nThe incubator is called Manos Accelerator. The venture takes its name from the Spanish word for hands. Avila and his co-founders say the name reflects the Latino work ethic. Avila's mother came to the valley from Costa Rica. Then she worked at a factory where food was canned.\n\nLatino tech leaders praised the move. They also cautioned it will face tough sledding.\n\n\"I think it's going to take another generation, maybe two,\" for Latinos to get away from thinking like people who just came to the country, said Hector Ruiz. He used to run computer chip giant AMD. Ruiz said Latino parents tend to urge their children to land steady jobs. They do not want them to risk starting their own businesses.\n\n## Low Latino Numbers In Sciences\n\nRuiz also pointed to the low numbers of Latinos who study science or business in college. Some do not even finish high school.\n\nJust 50 percent of Latino students in California public schools rate proficient or above in math, state figures show. That compares with 71 percent of whites and 85 percent of Asians.\n\nRichard Leza helped start a group to help Latinos make business connections 12 years ago. The group has struggled. You need connections to start a business, he said. \"The problem is, Hispanics are not in big venture firms or large corporations like Google and Yahoo.\"\n\nOne of the co-founders of Manos is Sylvia Flores. She worked 10 years ago with Vicente Fox on a venture that helps Mexican tech companies do business in Silicon Valley. Fox was president of Mexico at the time.\n\nFlores is a former IBM engineer. She brought in the third member of the founding team, David Lopez. He is a longtime computer technician whose daughter happens to be J-Lo. Flores built the website for a restaurant David and Jennifer Lopez once owned in Pasadena, Calif.\n\n## Pitching Their Ideas To The Stars\n\nThe 12-week Manos program will include a trip to Los Angeles for the entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to Latino stars including Mario Lopez and Eva Longoria. [Entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) are people who take the risk of starting a business.\n\nStartups chosen for more established incubators like Y Combinator get money for the businesses. The businesses at Manos won't. But Avila hopes to raise money to invest in future participants.\n\nMost of the founders in the first batch of startups live outside the San Francisco Bay Area. So Avila has hooked them up with housing. At his mom's place.\n\nEntrepreneurs in the program will give up a 4 percent stake in their companies. They will get coaches from Stanford, Apple and WalmartLabs, among others. It all leads up to a \"demo day\" at Google in November. The entrepreneurs will strut their stuff for people who could invest in their companies.\n\nAvila said Manos received 75 submissions after the program was announced in July. About a third came from Latin America.\n\n\"Everybody's talking about finding that next Mark Zuckerberg or that next Larry Page,\" Avila said. They are the founders of Facebook and Google. \"I'm hoping the next person they'll be talking about will be an Eric Florez. Why not?\"'"

She was waiting for her fourth-grade daughter to get on a library computer and start her homework.\n\n\"We don't have any Internet at home,\" Morua said. Her oldest child, 11-year-old Abel, was doing his homework on a library laptop. Alina, 9, had just reserved a desktop. Her wait time was 70 minutes.\n\nWith more schools giving homework online, many students can no longer do their homework at home. They have to go to their local library for Internet access. However, they find that many libraries do not have enough computers to go around.\n\n\"The laptops we do have, the batteries aren't working,\" said Patricia Readon. She is a children's librarian. \"The sad part is, if you don't have a computer, you can't do your homework.\"\n\n## Libraries Are Popular Places\n\nFor families without Internet, libraries are the place to be on school nights. Parents complain, though, that there are not enough computers.\n\nPauline Theobolds' 12-year-old son does his homework at the library. They have a computer at home, but it does not work properly with the school's Internet connection. They have to leave the library by 6:30 p.m. so she can get to her job as a nurse. \"The other night was tight because they didn't have any computers,\" she said.\n\nMiami-Dade's library system has an extra $4 million to spend this year. But that money is needed for salaries, new children's books and online tutoring. There is no money left over for more computers, said Gia Arbogast. She is in charge of the library system.\n\nOn the bright side, Arbogast said, older laptops have been replaced with new tablets.\n\nStill, more computers are needed, Arbogast said. \"It's an ongoing demand that we are struggling to keep up with.\"\n\n## Some Books Stay In Class\n\nSilvia Diaz is an official with the Miami-Dade school system. She said teachers should assign online homework only if all students in a class have Internet access at home.\n\n\"We really shouldn't be requiring kids to go to the library to complete assignments,\" Diaz said. \"A project or something special is OK.\" She added that daily homework assignments that depend on the computer are not OK.\n\nStill, the school district recently shifted to digital history books for ninth-graders. It gave all of them tablets loaded with the books.\n\nIsaiah Goulbourne, 16, is a junior at Miami Norland Senior High School. He uses an actual book for English, but it never leaves the classroom. \"We're not allowed to take them home because there aren't enough for everyone,\" he said. Most of his school books are online.\n\nGoulbourne said he relies on the library for his schoolwork because he does not have the Internet at home. Going to the library to use the Internet is especially popular in Miami Gardens. One out of five people who live there are poor.\n\n## Not Everyone Has Internet At Home\n\nA 2011 survey of young people at libraries found that nearly half of them said they did not have an Internet connection at home. Nationally, one-fifth of children live in homes without Internet access.\n\nHaving to leave the house for homework makes it harder for them to succeed in school, experts say.\n\nZach Leverenz runs EveryoneOn, which works with Miami-Dade to provide cheap Internet for students at home. He said that schools should not assume that students will find public Internet hotspots to do their homework.\n\nDiaz said the district wants to get to a point where every student has a computer or tablet and Internet access at home. She is in charge of digital learning at Miami-Dade schools.\n\n\"Unfortunately, so many of our kids are poor, so it's rather challenging,\" she said.\n\nMichele Stiles runs the South Dade Library. She said many libraries have long waits for computers.\n\nIf students cannot finish homework because of the wait, Stiles said, the library will give them an \"excuse\" note for their teacher.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - A Malaysia Airlines jet went missing Saturday. The FBI is sending agents and technical experts to help investigate the disappearance.\n\nThe plane left from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, with 239 people aboard. It was heading to Beijing, China's capital. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane.\n\nThree American citizens were aboard the lost flight. This fact allows the FBI to join the investigation, a top official in Washington said Saturday.\n\nHe said that a fourth passenger also may be a U.S citizen. The passenger was an infant flying with the three Americans.\n\nSince Americans were on the plane, the FBI can help with the case, the official said. He had to be secretive because the FBI investigation is just beginning. \"But so far what happened is a mystery,\" he said.\n\n## Was It Terrorism?\n\nU.S. officials said they are looking at whether this could be terrorism. Checking for signs of terrorism is normal in any plane crash. Two passengers apparently used stolen passports.\n\nPassports are documents. People need them when they travel from one country to another. One official said stolen passports being used is not a sign of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe official said there was \"no evidence\" of terrorism so far.\n\nThe federal law enforcement official said FBI agents will assist the investigation. The agents will review video of the airport in Kuala Lumpur. They'll be looking for images of passengers at the ticket counter, the security sections and the area where people boarded the plane. He said images they find can be used with the FBI's vast technology. Video can be matched with photos of known members of al-Qaida or other terrorist groups.\n\nBut he made clear that no known terrorist link has surfaced. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for making the plane crash.\n\n## Search-And-Rescue Operation\n\nVietnamese military aircraft participated in a search-and-rescue operation for the plane and its passengers. They spotted two oil slicks off the coast of southern Vietnam, the Associated Press reported. The slicks could be signs of a plane crash. But it hasn't been proven that they were from the missing jet.\n\nThe U.S. law enforcement official said that the government's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will probably be brought into the investigation. The jet was built by the company Boeing in the U.S. That could let the NTSB get involved.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is in charge of preventing terrorist attacks against the U.S. An official there said it would be a first if the plane was brought down by two terrorists who boarded the jet carrying stolen passports. \"We've never seen that,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that in the United States, passports and other travel documents are immediately run through lists kept on computer systems. A computer search would have turned up stolen or lost passports. He said that in Malaysia the security arrangement is not as tight. Stolen travel documents could have gotten two of the passengers through the security checkpoints, he said.\n\nHe cautioned that at this early stage, \"we can't say what it means yet.\" But he said that the two stolen passports have given investigators a reason to look for holes in security.\n\nThe Homeland Security source said that one passport was stolen from an Italian. It was taken from his rental car when he returned it in August in Malaysia. The second passport was stolen from an Austrian man two years ago, he said.\n\n## Stolen Passport List\n\n\"Just because they were stolen doesn't mean the travelers were terrorists,\" the Homeland Security source cautioned. \"They could have been nothing more than thieves. Or they could have simply bought the passports on the black market.\"\n\nAnother U.S. law enforcement official said an international list of lost and stolen passports exists. It is kept by an international police group. The group is called Interpol. Major international airlines routinely check Interpol's list before passengers board a flight. It would be unusual for a passenger on a major airline such as Malaysian Airways to be able to board using a stolen passport, he said.\n\nPassenger lists for international flights are checked against lists kept from U.S. intelligence agencies. But that happens if a plane makes a stop in the United States. The jet that disappeared did not have a U.S. stop on its travel plan.'"

            "text": "\tGeneral Plastics Manufacturing Co. in Tacoma, Washington, is hiring. But anyone who wants a job must first take a math test. The test has 18 questions, takes 30 minutes, and using a calculator is OK.\n\nThe company makes foam products for aircraft. It asks applicants how to convert inches to feet. They also must show they know how to read a tape measure. They are quizzed on how to find the density of a block of foam. Answer: divide the mass by the volume.\n\nBasic middle school math, right? It's supposed to be.\n\nBut only 1 in 10  job seekers pass, even though the company only gives the test to applicants with a high school education.\n\nThis troubles Eric Hahn, a vice president at General Plastics. Hahn said that scores on his company's math test have been poor for the past six years. And that is not just bad luck at a single factory. He talks with other Washington state suppliers in his line of business. Most of them have been seeing the same problem.\n\n## Math Skills Lacking\n\n\"You could think that even for production, do you really need to know math?\" said Jacey Wilkins, a spokeswoman for the Manufacturing Institute. \"But the truth is, you do.\" Wilkins explained that today's factory jobs are very complex. Workers need to understand and work with multiple functions and systems.\n\nWhen it comes to working with precise machinery \"people really do need a basic understanding of math,\" she said.\n\nBut math has been a problem. The United States ranks below average in math. Other wealthy countries performed much better. The National Math and Science Initiative noted that more than half of high school graduates are not ready to go on in math.\n\nAfter many tough years, U.S. businesses are starting to perform better. They are looking to hire new workers. However, a lack of basic math skills could be a problem for people seeking work.\n\nFactories are willing to train people about their machines and technology, explained Linda Nguyen, CEO of Work Force Central, a partnership that trains workers in Washington. \"But they can't afford to hire someone who needs to relearn basic math.\"\n\nTeachers are aware of what factories like General Plastics face. They are looking for ways to make math relate to the real world. That way, students will grasp why math is necessary.  And that will make them want to stick with it. Some educators want to change the way math is taught.\n\n\"It's really been rote memorization,\" said Dave Yanofsky of ConnectEd: The California Center for College and Career. Rote learning means committing something to memory, often without really understanding the meaning.\n\nThe center encourages what it calls \"linked learning\" in high school. Linked learning combines academics, technical education and work experience. The center has developed a middle-school math program that uses projects and encourages group work.\n\n## Making Sense Of Math\n\nLinda Gojak is president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. She complains that the traditional style of teaching math is like \"practicing the piano.\" Students are told to practice until they can finally do it. But her group is trying to \"help teachers teach mathematics so kids make sense of what they're doing.\" She adds, \"and it really does stick beyond what they learn in class.\"\n\nA new program is being tested in 20 school districts in California. The program is designed to make classroom learning more relevant to the working world.\n\nMath learning also will change with the [Common Core](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Common+Core) standards. The Common Core is an effort to set new goals in math and English. Forty-five states will teach the Common Core.  It will apply to all students in kindergarten through high school. The Common Core standards will teach students what they need to know for success in college and jobs, said Sam Houston, president and CEO of the North Carolina Science, Math and Technology Education Center.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of the states that will be using the Common Core. \"In the hands of a trained professional,\" Houston said, \"the Common Core should give everyone a better means to answer the question, 'Why do I need to know this?'\"\n\nFor factory bosses like Hahn, changes in teaching math cannot come soon enough.\n\n\"Manpower training for manufacturing is a critical issue right now,\" he said. \"The development of highly skilled workers is essential if we are to produce good products and grow our industry.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - More and more medical devices are getting hooked up to the Internet these days. Others are hooked up to private networks.\n\nThese devices include pumps that deliver drugs to the body. X-rays and defibrillators - which regulate the heart - are also linked to networks.\n\nThis connection can be a security risk. The devices can fall prey to criminals, or hackers who want to show of their technical skills.\n\nChris Carroll remembers the first time he saw someone hack into an insulin pump. They made it deliver a deadly dose of insulin.\n\nThe pump wasn't connected to anyone, but Carroll got the point: The danger was real.\n\nIt hit home, too. Carroll has Type 1 diabetes. He wears a pump that delivers insulin directly into his body. The insulin helps people with diabetes keep their blood sugar at healthy levels.\n\n## Information Sharing Part Of The Problem\n\n\"The health care industry is not technically prepared\" to fight the basic ways that cyber criminals break in online, an April FBI report said. It also said banks and retailers are more prepared for these attacks.\n\nExperts also are worried that deaths could happen accidentally. People are becoming more dependent on medical devices that share information. This increases the chance for problems.\n\nFrank Painter is a health care expert. He said we most have to worry about \"an unsecure system being able to be violated by accident.\"\n\nThe technology magazine Wired published a report in April. It said that an official from Essentia Health found that cyber intruders can change how drug pumps work. They can do the same thing to X-rays and defibrillators, which give a shock to the heart. They can even change temperature settings on medical refrigerators that store drugs and blood.\n\n## Hackers Can Make Cash\n\nThe security official is Scott Erven. His study was conducted in the Midwest over two years. Eyren couldn't be reached to comment for this article.\n\nHospitals are moving patient records to computer networks. The change means hackers can make a lot of money. The FBI report notes that even partial electronic health records are illegally selling for $50 each. Social Security cards and credit card numbers only fetch $1 apiece.\n\nElectronic health records contain detailed patient information. This allows all the patient's health care providers to share that information. These records are attractive targets to hackers. They can be used to sell drug prescriptions.\n\n## Pay Attention!\n\nMichael Carome is the director of health research at Public Citizen, a consumer rights group in Washington. He said it was hard to say how big the risk of private medical information leaks was. But public health officials should be paying attention, he said.\n\nThe FBI report mentions research from the SANS Institute. SANS is a private company that specializes in Internet protection training. It concluded that some systems and devices could be broken into for extended periods. Companies, when notified of the problems, did not repair them, SANS said.\n\n\"The time to act is yesterday,\" the report says.\n\nCarroll is familiar with device makers' indifference to security concerns. After he saw the insulin pump hacking demonstration, he contacted his own pump provider.\n\n\"Both of the people I talked to had no idea this was possible, and had no answer regarding plans to fix the issue,\" he said. \"They tried the whole, 'Well, even if it's possible, no one would do it.'\"\n\nSo far Carroll's pump maker has been right. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the agency isn't aware of any patient injuries or deaths related to hacking.\n\n## The Risks Are Real\n\nStill, at least some users think the risks are real. Dick Cheney was vice president from 2001 to 2009. In 2007, he had the wireless function on his heart defibrillator disabled. He feared it made him more at risk of a terrorist attack. But most people don't face the same level of personal risk.\n\nTypically, problems with medical devices are identified by or reported to the FDA. But the quickly growing number of new devices calls into question the FDA's capacity to monitor them.\n\n\"The FDA really can't legislate down to the line and code of security for every situation,\" said Painter.\n\nPainter also said the FDA's general standards were sufficient. The responsibility for ensuring device protection belongs to the manufacturers, he said. \"Good designers can build good, safe, secure designs in the first place, pretty simply.\" If they did that, it would stop \"somebody from doing something bad,\" he said.\n\nLike Painter, the FDA maintains that ultimately it is the manufacturers' responsibility to find risks associated with medical devices. This includes \"risks related to cyber security.\"'"

            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - The University of Pennsylvania is at the cutting edge of a drive to experiment with free online courses that are open to anyone. But its own study found out that, so far, the courses have had mixed results.\n\nThe courses are known as MOOCs. That stands for Massive Open Online Courses. They have attracted millions of viewers and have been promoted as a possible way to address skyrocketing education costs. Yet, only 4 out of every 100 students actually complete the courses, according to a new study by the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMany who sign up drop off after the first week or two, the study found. About half who signed up viewed one lecture or more.\n\nThe results come on the heels of another Penn study, released last month. It showed that most students enrolled in MOOCs already had college degrees. People are taking the courses mostly to get ahead in their jobs.\n\n## Learning New Job Skills\n\nPeople believed that MOOCs would help make degrees possible for people who couldn't afford it. This doesn't seem to be happening.\n\n\"The technology offers some promise of a new approach to addressing both\" costs and getting education for poor people, said Laura Perna. She helped run the new study. But she said no one knows yet how well it will actually work.\n\nThe researchers looked at 1 million users. They registered for 16 free courses offered from June 2012 to June 2013. The classes were taught by Penn professors and offered in partnership with an online education company.\n\nThe study looked into when users enter and leave courses. And it looked at when and how they take part in classes. The courses varied in how quizzes were used and in homework and instruction time. Students in courses with smaller workloads were slightly more likely to complete the course.\n\nMost courses focused on learning to improve yourself or learning new job skills. One such class was on how to save someone who is having a heart attack.\n\nPerna said she was a bit surprised by the results.\n\n\"I didn't expect it to be quite this low,\" she said of the number of people who finished the courses.\n\n## Learning For Fun\n\nBut Ed Rock, who heads Penn's MOOC classes, disagrees. He called the findings \"entirely unsurprising and not at all troubling.\" There are 1.6 million current users of MOOCs. Even if only 4 out of every 100 people complete them, that is still 80,000 people.\n\nRock says that \"80,000 people is a huge number to educate.\"\n\nHe also said those who did not complete the courses had gotten something from the experience.\n\nMost MOOC users are doing it to learn for fun or to get ahead in their jobs. So, it's not surprising that few finish, said Cathy Sandeen of the American Council on Education.\n\nShe says there is a place for MOOCs to help people earn degrees. But the opportunity is probably smaller than originally thought, she said.\n\nRock admits that educators have a way to go in learning how to fit MOOCs into the educational mission. So Penn has partnered with 10 high schools. Teachers in those schools are using a Penn online course in addition to classroom learning.\n\n\"Our hope is our material will be of value. We won't know that unless (high school teachers) try it out and tell us,\" he said.\n\nPerna agreed that MOOCs could benefit society. She mentioned the case of a neighbor who is taking a MOOC with co-workers. Each week they meet to discuss what they've learned.\n\n\"I think there is something there,\" she said. But we need to understand better what MOOCs' place is in education, she added. '"

            "text": "\tMIAMI - The remote-controlled plane known as a drone has been used to fight terrorists and criminals. Now, it is about to take on a new enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.\n\nIn the Florida Keys on Sept. 2, testing started on a next-generation drone. Officials hope it will provide high-tech help in the daily battle against mosquitoes.\n\nThe new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of a typical Florida sea hawk. It won't spray or blast bugs. Instead, it will carry a special camera that picks up differences in temperature.\n\nThe goal is to survey the area's hard-to-get-to mangrove swamps. These are the breeding grounds for the marsh mosquito, the biggest biter in the island chain.\n\n## Spotting Where Biters Breeding\n\nMosquitoes thrive in shallow pools of water. In just days, they grow from tiny larval worms to buzzing blood-suckers. The hope is that the bird-size drone will be able to spot mosquito-infested pools by picking up small differences in temperature. This could save mosquito-fighters time, effort and money.\n\n\"Our people on the ground have to walk an hour to a marsh and find out what's there,'' said district leader Michael Doyle. \"It's hard to cover all those places at once. If something like this could allow them to map where the water is, we could move a lot more quickly.''\n\nThe new drone may or may not prove to be a good mosquito hunter. But even if it doesn't, the test shows how unmanned planes are quickly changing. Drones have revolutionized warfare and have been adopted by law enforcement. But they also are being used by scientists and businesses in more and more ways.\n\nThey've helped spot outlawed hunting in Africa. They've been used to track wildfires in California. They've recorded gases spewing from a volcano in Costa Rica. And researchers at the University of Florida hope to use drones in many other new ways. Drones no bigger than paper airplanes may soon gather information from dangerous hurricanes or ice shelves.\n\n## Like iPhone Apps\n\nThe new anti-mosquito drone was developed by Prioria Robotics, a small Gainesville company founded by University of Florida students. It has been named the Maveric.\n\n\"I would have laughed two years ago if you told me this could help with mosquito control,\" said company salesman Derek Lyons. \"You put it in people's hands and it becomes like the iPhone. You have no idea what the applications are going to be.''\n\nIf it works in the Keys, it will be helping Florida's largest and most challenging mosquito-control operation.\n\nMarsh mosquitoes aren't dangerous like Aedes aegypti, which spreads dengue fever. But they are the most common kind. Huge numbers are born after every rainstorm and whenever flooding occurs. The key to controlling them, Doyle said, is using helicopters to hit breeding areas with small doses of of bacteria. This kills developing insects before they hatch and fly away.\n\nDoyle said the method gets rid of about 80 percent of marsh mosquitoes. Those that escape can be controlled by spraying. However, spraying is now forbidden in more and more places. This is because spraying also kills certain rare tropical butterflies.\n\n## Like A Paper Airplane\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to spray for adults, Doyle said. Therefore the aim now is to get better at finding pools of water full of unhatched mosquitos.\n\nThe battery-powered drone weighs 2.6 pounds and has a wing span of just over 2\\xc2\\xbd feet. It can easily be launched by hand like a paper airplane. Or, thanks to bendable wings, it can be shot from a six-inch-diameter carrying tube. The drone can fly for up to 70 minutes at about 30 mph. As it flies, its rotating camera sends live video to a laptop computer.\n\nThe drone costs $65,000.\n\nDoyle isn't sure yet if buying a drone is a good idea. Will it really be possible to spot pools that are only a few inches deep? Or will they simply blend in with the soggy soil?\n\nFred Culbertson admitted that it may take time to figure out the best way to go mosquito hunting. He's piloting the test flights. \"Once we get down and work with them for a couple of days, we can probably tweak things to make it work.\"'"

            "title": "Mystery surrounds an airliner's disappearance",
            "text": "\tWELLINGTON, New Zealand - About 77 years ago, American pilot Amelia Earhart's plane disappeared.\n\nNow another plane is missing. People say it must be somewhere. But then again, the same thing was said about Earhart's aircraft.\n\nMore than 10 days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared, an international search has produced no sign of the plane. This raises a difficult question: What if the airplane is never found?\n\nAlthough unlikely, not finding the plane would certainly be horrible for the families of those missing. It would also be a problem for the airlines. How can they fix the problem, if they don't know what happened?\n\n## The Earhart Mystery\n\nHistory is not short of such mysteries. The most famous mystery of all is what happened to Earhart.\n\n\"When something like this happens that (shocks) us. We're offended by it, and we're scared by it,\" said Ric Gillespie. He used to investigate place accidents. He started The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, or TIGHAR for short. Gillespie has led expeditions to an island in the Pacific Ocean, where Earhart may have crash landed in 1937. He wrote a book about her disappearance.\n\nWe think we have control over our lives, Gillespie said, \"and it's just been shown to us that oh, folks, you know what? A really big airliner can just vanish. And nobody wants to hear that.\"\n\nEarhart, the first female pilot to cross the Atlantic Ocean, vanished over the Pacific with her navigator, Fred Noonan. They were attempting to fly around the globe. Nearly 80 years later, people are still fascinated by their disappearance.\n\nThere have been many theories about what happened. They range from her simply running out of fuel and crashing, to staging her own disappearance. According to that theory, she secretly returned to the U.S. to live under a different name.\n\nOne of the best guesses has her crash-landing on a reef near Gardner Island, now called Nikumaroro. Expeditions to the Pacific island have found artifacts possibly from her plane. They include tools and the bones of what was possibly a tall white woman of European ancestry. The bones have since been lost.\n\n## The Bermuda Triangle\n\nPeople are also obsessed with the Bermuda Triangle in the Atlantic Ocean. Five bombers planes disappeared there in 1945. Studies show, though, that the Bermuda Triangle is no more dangerous than any other part of the ocean.\n\nAndrew Thomas is the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Transportation Security. Planes are not as advanced as many people might think, he said. Airports and airplanes around the world use old radar technology, instead of modern GPS satellite navigation systems. Radar is more than 60 years old. Many people have GPS systems in their cars to help them find their way.\n\nA GPS system might not have solved the mystery. The plane disappeared March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to China's capital Beijing. But it would probably have given searchers a better idea of the plane's last known location, Thomas said.\n\nExperts say the disappearance will likely pressure airlines and governments to better track planes. Flight 370 vanished after it signed off with Malaysian air-traffic controllers. It never made contact with Vietnam's air-traffic controllers as it should have.\n\nA failed search would be the worst, of course, for the families of the missing.\n\n\"In any kind of death, the most important matter for relatives and loved ones is knowing\" what happened and how it happened, said Kevin Tso. He is in charge of Victim Support that has been counseling family and friends of New Zealand passengers aboard the flight. \"When there's very little information, it's very difficult.\"\n\n## Searching A Vast Area\n\nAll the guessing about what happened to the plane in the media and elsewhere is not helpful, Tso said. Families still hold the unlikely hope that their loved ones are still alive.\n\nMore than two dozen countries are looking for the missing plane. Dozens of planes and boats are searching along a vast area where investigators believe it ended up.\n\nGillespie expects the plane will eventually be found. Investigators, though, may have to wait until pieces of the airplane wash up on the shore.\n\n\"We all expect we're going to find this plane and the chances are probably pretty good that we'll find something. But you know, I think everyone thought that about Amelia Earhart as well,\" said Phaedra Hise. She is a pilot and author of \"Pilot Error: The Anatomy of a Plane Crash.\"\n\n''We know there's a chance that we may never find out what happened,\" she said. \"Which is a little scary, isn't it?\"'"

            "title": "For the first time, a plane with no pilot makes successful landing on ship",
            "text": "\tThe U.S. Navy made history Wednesday when an experimental airplane landed off the coast of Virginia. It was the first time that a [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), or a plane with no pilot, landed on an aircraft carrier at sea.\n\nThe test flight of the drone called X-47B \"Salty Dog 502\" could dramatically change naval flying.\n\nLanding on an aircraft carrier as it is tossed by the ocean waves is seen as a very difficult task. It is challenging even for the most experienced pilot. The X-47B was controlled almost entirely by computer.\n\nAircraft carriers are expected to keep working for 50 years. Carriers need to work with new types of aircraft like the X-47B and other drones to stay useful during that time, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus said.\n\nThe X-47B was built by Northrop Grumman Corp. On Wednesday morning it was launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier _George H.W. Bush._ The drone safely flew above the Atlantic Ocean, then returned for a landing on the carrier.\n\nThe drone relied on advanced computer systems. It was given special directions from satellites above the earth. It talked with the carrier's computers to find out speed, wind direction and everything else it needed to know. It was able to get this information from miles away.\n\nShortly before 1:45 p.m. it hit the flight deck. It hooked the wire on the deck used to stop aircraft and landed safely.\n\nThe test flight was seen as an important event in drone development. The military has been working on the drone program for eight years.\n\n## A Drone Like No Other Drone Before It\n\nDrones in general are able to fly farther and stay in the air longer than manned aircraft. This is because they do not depend on a human pilot's endurance. Navy fighter pilots may fly missions that last as long as 10 hours. Current drones can fly for three times that long.\n\nCurrently, human pilots control combat drones from command centers far away. But the X-47B is designed to fly a combat mission controlled almost entirely by a computer. A human pilot would design its flight path and then send it on its way. The computer program would guide it from a ship to the target and back.\n\nWhat makes this drone different from others is that it is jet-powered. It is also very difficult for the enemy to notice.\n\nThe X-47B has a 62-foot wingspan and can fly higher than 40,000 feet. It can travel more than 2,400 miles and can reach very high speeds.\n\nThe \"X\" in X-47B stands for \"experimental.\" The drone is designed to show off new technology. It can take off and land automatically. The drone also can carry 4,500 pounds of weapons. The Navy, however, said it has no plans to arm the aircraft.\n\n## Getting Ready For The X-47B's Big Day\n\nThe original X-47B had its first flight from Edwards Air Force Base in 2011. Tests continued there until last year. Then it was taken by truck from the Mojave Desert to a naval air base in Maryland. The design of the X-47B looks very futuristic. Drivers passing it on the highway thought it was an alien spaceship.\n\nOver the last year, the Navy conducted tests from the shore at the air base. It also conducted other tests to show that the X-47B could be used safely on an aircraft carrier flight deck.\n\nIn May the drone had its first carrier-catapulted flight. Catapults help an aircraft reach enough speed to take off.\n\nTwo X-47Bs were built for $1.4 billion. Both were constructed behind barbed-wire fences and double security doors at Northrop's plant in Palmdale, Calif.\n\nMuch of the design work was done at the company's offices in two other parts of California.'"

            "title": "Neanderthals made tools from bone, not just stone, study says",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - Scientists in Europe say they found strong evidence that Neanderthals made their own specialized tools from bones.\n\nThe find adds to the evidence that Neanderthals were more advanced than previously thought. They may not have been the brutish, club lugging ape-men shown in movies. Neanderthals are the closest extinct human relative.\n\nArchaeologists said they discovered four pieces of bone tools known as lissoirs at two Neanderthal sites in southwestern France. They described the findings in a science magazine.\n\nThe pieces are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said archaeologist Marie Soressi of The Netherlands.\\n## Bone Tools Used In Leatherwork\n\nBefore this, tools dug up where Neanderthals used to live were almost exclusively made of stone. Bone tools were more common at early modern-human sites. So many scholars believe that Neanderthals adopted the technology from their more advanced relatives.\n\nBut the recently found lissoirs are about 41,000 to 51,000 years old. They could have been in Europe before modern humans got there. So Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools themselves, Soressi and her team wrote.\n\n\"I don't think that the image of the brutish or stupid Neanderthal is true anymore,\" said Paola Villa of the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.\n\nAncient lissoirs were made from animal ribs. Leather workers probably scraped the tools against hides to create shinier, waterproof leather. Craftspeople still use lissoirs today.\n\nSoressi's group found the first piece of a lissoir at an excavation site in southwestern France in 2005. Archaeologist William Rendu noticed the unusual piece of deer rib. He saw that its shape and markings weren't what would be found in a deer's body. They did not come from the bone being worn away by sand and stone, either, he said.\n\nThe small piece was examined under a microscope. The piece had a worn edge and a polished surface. Those characteristics suggested that it had come from a tool.\\n## Not Just Copies Of Stone Tools\n\n\"It was obvious it was a lissoir,\" Soressi said. Lissoirs in use today have a similar design. The ancient piece was probably a tip that had broken off, she said.\n\nThen the researchers made their own lissoirs and scraped them against animal hides. They compared their tools to the piece they had found, using a microscope. The tools showed the same signs of wear.\n\nSoressi shared her findings with Shannon McPherron. He is an archaeologist from Germany who was researching Neanderthal behavior at a nearby site.\n\nMcPherron and his coworkers began searching his site for lissoir pieces too. The group found three over the next seven years, and confirmed they too were from leather-working tools.\n\n\"We didn't expect to find these bones,\" said McPherron. \"We were thrilled.\"\n\nArchaeologists had discovered bone tools at Neanderthal sites before. But these were the first that weren't just copies of existing stone tools, McPherron said. They were designed to take advantage of bone, McPherron said.\n\nRibs can bend a bit. Stone can't, he said. You want the bone to bend a little bit when working with an animal skin, he explained.\\n## Shows Advanced Behavoir\n\nTests showed one of the lissoirs came from 51,000 years ago. Modern humans did not get to Europe until thousands of years later. This suggests that our ancestors may have adopted the practice of making bone tools from the continent's earlier Neanderthal inhabitants.\n\nOr modern humans arrived earlier than previously thought, and influenced the Neanderthals, Soressi said.\n\n\"It's a hard call,\" said Donald Henry. He's an archaeologist from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. Henry said most of the evidence suggested that Neanderthals adopted the technology from modern humans.\n\nBut it does not matter if Neanderthals had copied things from modern humans. It would not mean that modern humans were better, Henry said. \"There are many examples of human societies adopting technologies from other societies,\" he said. That doesn't mean \"that the ones who adopted it were stupid.\"\n\nThere is other evidence that Neanderthals showed advanced behavior. They used tree resin as glue. They waterproofed their boats with pitch, Villa said.\n\n\"Maybe they didn't have opera, but they weren't dumb,\" Henry added. \"They survived hundreds of thousands of years. We haven't done that yet.\"'"

            "text": "\tIn 1940 Mavis Batey was sent to a rundown mansion in Bletchley Park during World War II. She was 19. She joined a group that broke the German code so that Britain and its allies could understand their enemy's secret messages.\n\nBatey was a college student. She was studying the structure of the German language. She became one of Bletchley Park's best decoders. She broke the code on a message that led to a stunning British victory over the Italian navy. She also was the first to crack the secret messages of the Abwehr, the German spy group. That breakthrough helped ensure the success of the D-Day landings.\n\n\"She was the last of the great break-in experts ... who broke codes or ciphers that no one else had ever broken,\" said British historian Michael Smith. He wrote several books on Bletchley Park.\n\nBatey also became known for her work as a garden historian. She died of natural causes on Nov. 12, said Katherine Lynch of the Bletchley Park Trust. She was 92.\n\n## A Message With The L Missing\n\nEnigma was the name of the German device that turned messages into code. It was developed in 1918. Batey knew nothing about Enigma when she got to Bletchley Park.\n\nEnigma resembled a typewriter. It had 26 lettered keys. But it was far more complicated. It had three or four electrically wired wheels. The wheels could produce endless combinations of coded letters. To make deciphering even more difficult, there were a number of different models. Each model had its own way of changing the message.\n\nBatey hardly got any introduction.\n\n\"Hello, we're breaking machines. Have you got a pencil?\" said her boss, legendary code breaker Alfred Dillwyn \"Dilly\" Knox, when they met. He then handed her a stack of coded messages.\n\nOne day she was examining a message sent on the Italian navy's Enigma. She noticed there was not one L in it. Enigma never encoded a letter as itself. So an L in a message was not an L when it was first written. Batey suspected that she was looking at a test message a lazy operator had made by repeatedly pressing the L key.\n\nWith this discovery, \"Mavis broke the main Italian naval Enigma,\" Smith told the Los Angeles Times last week. She did this based on one message.\n\nIn March 1941 she decoded a far more important message. The Italian navy had sent a message that said, \"Today's the day minus three.\" The message signaled a major attack in three days. The next intercepted message supplied details of the battle plan.\n\nThe decoded information allowed the Royal Navy to hand Italy its worst defeat at sea.\n\n## Helped Double Cross Nazi Germany\n\nBatey's most important contribution came in late 1941. She worked with Knox and Margaret Rock to break the super-tough Enigma machine used by the Abwehr. Batey decoded a message between Berlin and Belgrade. That message allowed her team to understand how the machine coded a message. Days later, she broke the code of a second Abwehr machine.\n\nThese breakthroughs were very important for the success of the Double Cross System. Double Cross was a British operation that used captured German spies to feed false information back to Germany.\n\nThe phony intelligence included misleading reports about where the main Allied invasion force would land. Based on the bad information, Germany moved its forces to the wrong place. That doomed its chances of beating back the historic D-Day landing on June 6, 1944.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower later said the secrets broken at Bletchley Park shortened the war by two years.\n\n\"There is nothing like seeing a code broken, that is really the absolute tops,\" Batey told Smith in his 1998 book \"Station X: The Code Breakers of Bletchley Park.\"\n\n## Brilliance In A Dank Cottage\n\nBatey was born Mavis Lillian Lever on May 5, 1921. She was studying at University College, London, when she was noticed and asked to take the code breaking job. She thought the work would make her a glamorous spy.\n\nInstead, she spent the war years in a damp and dreary cottage at Bletchley Park. But she was surrounded by brilliant people.\n\nBatey also met her future husband there, Keith Batey. He was a mathematician in the unit that decoded German army and air force Enigma messages. They married in 1942.\n\nKeith Batey died in 2010. Mavis Batey is survived by their son and two daughters.\n\nLater in life, Batey became one of England's best-known garden historians.\n\nShe was also a model for the code breaker played by actress Kate Winslet in \"Enigma,\" the 2001 movie about Bletchley Park.\n\nBy then, Batey was known as a hero to her fellow Britons. But she never much cared for that title.\n\n\"I was just part of a team. We were all part of a team,\" she told a British newspaper last year. \"The heroes were the chaps who were fighting on D-Day.\"'"

A year ago, Shaw was in a game when suffered a brain injury called a concussion. He was temporarily unable to walk or speak. He also lost his memory, forcing him to stop taking two high school classes.\n\nHe could not go to his team's games, even to watch. The lights and noise made him uncomfortable.\n\nThis season, though, he's back on the field.\n\n## Concussions, And Some Deaths\n\nNearly 1,500 high school football players in Missouri suffered concussions in 2012. Most of them returned to action within two weeks, according to Missouri high school officials.\n\nThe attention given to concussions has never been greater.\n\nBut what happens afterward is less sure. It is not clear when a high school player is ready to return to the football field after suffering a head injury.\n\n\"I think we all worry about sending a kid back out there too soon. Any doctor who says otherwise is lying,\" said Greg Canty. He is director of the Center for Sports Medicine at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.\n\nSeventeen high school football players died in 2013.\n\nDoctors said they are even more concerned with \"second-impact syndrome.\" The often deadly condition occurs when a player suffers a second concussion before the first has healed.\n\n## Teens' Brains Still Growing\n\nThe brain is in more danger once there are signs of a concussion, Canty said. A second hit could case a really bad injury, he said.\n\nYouths face the most danger from second-impact syndrome. The reason is that their brains are still growing, says Brett Osborn. He is a brain doctor who has studied concussions in sports.\n\nNot all high school players with concussions are treated the same.\n\nBrian Mahaffey wrote an article about concussions. He says that high school athletes should be without signs of a concussion for seven days before practicing again. A younger player should wait 10 days, he said.\n\nOsborn thinks children should stay out longer. He says they should not play for at least six weeks after suffering a concussion, even if it's mild.\n\nState laws are not so cautious.\n\nMissouri says a player must be out for only 24 hours before being checked out. Kansas has no such rule.\n\n## Some Quit Football\n\nA player who has suffered a concussion immediately becomes more likely to suffer another one.\n\nAs a result, Mahaffey suggests to some patients they quit football, but the question is when.\n\nBarb Kunz's son Alex took a bad hit during practice in 2013.\n\nA day later, Alex was having trouble with easy math. He remembers walking to the cafeteria for lunch feeling confused. As he sat down for lunch, he shook his two milk cartons like he did every day. But this time, he had opened the cartons before shaking them and milk sprayed everywhere.\n\n\"It took me a good half second before I realized I was showering myself with milk,\" he said.\n\nAlex left school 20 minutes later to see a doctor, who said he had a concussion. His mother said he and his brother could never play football again.\n\n## Do Computerized Tests Work?\n\nLiberty High School defender Josh Watson hit a running back on the first play of the 2014 season. The hit was enough to send Watson to the ground and he needed someone to help him walk to the sideline.\n\nThe team's trainers said Watson had to come out of the game because they thought he might have a concussion. Watson rejoined the team the following Wednesday, after it was decided he did not have a concussion.\n\nSeveral area high schools in Missouri and Kansas have added a new program. So have some middle schools. Players take a computerized test before the season, which gives them a base score.\n\nIf a player is later thought to have had some sort of head injury, he takes the test again. Then the two scores are compared.\n\nCanty is not sure the tests work and thinks they can make people feel incorrectly sure that a player is safe. \"Many times we need more and better evidence\" to be sure, he said.'"

            "text": "\tVATICAN CITY - On Tuesday, the Vatican served tea and cucumber sandwiches. The purpose of the gathering was not to discuss religion, however. Instead, it was to announce the launching of the Vatican's first-ever cricket team.\n\nNo, [Pope Francis](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) won't be playing the game himself. He still prefers soccer and remains a fan of his beloved San Lorenzo club.\n\nBut he and the Vatican, which is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, have long championed sports. They see them as good for mind, body and soul. The new team will be known as the St. Peter's Cricket Club.\n\nAn Australian, John McCarthy, first came up with the idea. He said he hopes the St. Peter's Cricket Club will play the Church of England sometime next fall.\n\n## Engaging Other Faiths\n\nMcCarthy said the aim of the team is to encourage communication between the world's different religions. Cricket is immensely popular in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Perhaps one day, McCarthy hopes, the new team will play Muslims or Hindus from those countries.\n\nAnd, McCarthy added, there is another reason for the cricket team. He wants to educate Italy, the Vatican and even Pope Francis about something: There is a sport other than soccer!\n\nMcCarthy then got busy passing around cucumber sandwiches. Served with tea, these have long been the favorite snack at cricket matches.\n\nThe new team will be made up of cricket-playing religious students and priests. It will be fielded as early as the spring. Rome's Capannelle Cricket Club is letting the Vatican use its playing field.\n\n## \"A Bit Ironic, Actually\"\n\nLondon, England, prides itself as the home of cricket. Reached there, Adam Chadwick of Lord's Cricket Ground welcomed the new Vatican team. What's more, he seemed open to a Vatican versus Church of England match. This, he said, could take place on one of Lord's playing fields.\n\nChadwick admitted that people think of cricket as a game played only by wealthy gentlemen. This idea, he said, dates from the late 19th century. But cricket began very differently: The game was originally played by ordinary people, not noblemen.\n\n\"The first mentions that we found in this country\" describe \"an ordinary man\" playing on Sunday, when he would have been at church. \"Which is a bit ironic, actually,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nCricket is enormously popular in places like India. And this, Chadwick said, is actually much more in line with the game's beginnings. The game became popular in India when that country was part of the British Empire.\n\n## Playing For The Masses\n\nIndeed, the Vatican made it clear it wasn't thinking of English high society. Instead, it had in mind cricket's worldwide popularity. So the new cricket team fits in neatly with Pope Francis' aim for the church: He wants it to reach out to the poorest, all over the world.\n\nThe Vatican already has its \"Clericus Cup\" soccer tournament. In this, the Vatican's Swiss Guards play various teams made up of religious students.\n\nAnd just on Sunday, the Vatican organized a \"Race of Faith.\" A 100-meter (328-foot) track was laid down along the main avenue leading to St. Peter's Square. The idea was to point out the religious and educational value of sports.'"

            "text": "\tScientists have bad news for young dancers. They are not getting as much exercise as they might think.\n\nA new study reports that fewer than 1 in 10 kids are getting enough exercise in their dance classes. For teens who dance, the numbers are even worse.\n\nThe study about dance and exercise was put together by scientists from San Diego State University and the University of California, San Diego. More than 250 young dancers helped with their project.\n\n## Dance Flunks Daily 30-Minute Goal\n\nGirls wore special belts while they were dancing. They took classes like ballet, jazz and hip-hop. The belts recorded how much time the girls spent in motion and how quickly they were moving.\n\nGovernment health officials say students should get 30 minutes of exercise during each school day. They also encourage students to do another 30 minutes of exercise after school.\n\nScientists studied seven different types of dance for their report. None of them kept the dancers working long enough to meet the 30-minute goal.\n\n## Hip-Hop Dance Classes Earn Top Score\n\nSome dance classes were better than others. Some kids ages 5 to 10 took a Spanish dance class that lasted almost an hour. They only spent six minutes of the class really dancing fast enough to count as exercise.\n\nDancers in the ballet class got 14 minutes of exercise. Students who did partner dances like ballroom and swing dancing got 22 minutes of exercise per class.\n\nHip-hop classes scored the highest. Dancers did 27 minutes of hard work in those classes.\n\nFor older dancers, the results were not much different. Students ages 11 to 18 danced for about 17 minutes of their ballet classes and 16 minutes of each hip- hop class. Spanish dancing came in last again. Dancers in that class got only about four minutes of real exercise per class.\n\n## Teen Dancers Get Less Exercise Than Kids\n\nNone of the teen dance classes met the 30-minute goal. The students were in the classes for much longer than 30 minutes, but they did not have to push themselves that whole time.\n\nThe study also showed that most teenage dancers are getting less exercise than the 5- to 10-year-old group. Scientists were surprised about that. Older students usually go to longer, more advanced classes. That gives them better opportunities to get exercise.\n\nThe scientists tried to find a reason why older dancers would be dancing less than the kids group. Teens have longer, harder dance routines. Maybe they had to stand around while they were learning the moves. The younger students might just be moving around more. Maybe they are not standing still in line while waiting for their turn.\n\n## Team Sports Give Kids A Better Workout\n\nWhen the study was finished, the scientists took a good look at the results. They decided that team sports gave kids much more exercise than dance classes.\n\nScientists agree that there is a lot of standing around no matter which one kids choose, but playing sports offers something extra. It pushes kids harder.\n\nFor example, dancers wind up standing around for about a third of each class. Soccer players stand still just as much, but when they are moving, it is faster and harder. Soccer players spend another third of each practice working up a sweat and giving it their all.\n\nDoctors say that is the type of exercise that keeps kids from becoming overweight. Dancers hardly ever have to move that way.\n\nDance can be difficult, but it is challenging in a different way. It is fun to do and fun to watch, but it just does not offer the same health benefits as sports.'"

            "title": "The mystery of deflated footballs, did the Patriots do it on purpose?",
            "text": "\tFOXBOROUGH, Mass. - The Super Bowl is this Sunday. It is the biggest, most important football game of the year. This year, the New England Patriots are playing against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nTo get to the Super Bowl, the Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts on January 18th. They won the game 45 to 7. But now some people are saying that they cheated.\n\nThe footballs that the Patriots used against the Colts did not have the right amount of air in them. As a result, they were softer than normal footballs and easier to throw and catch. This may have helped the Patriots beat the Colts. If air was let out of the balls on purpose, it would have been cheating.\n\n## Footballs Used In First Half\n\nYou may not be able to tell when you're watching a game on TV, but each team uses its own footballs when it is on offense. The two teams take turns playing offense and defense, and the balls that are used switch with each turn. It seems that the balls that the Patriots played with were softer and easier to handle than they should have been.\n\nAfter the first half of the game, the Colts told referees that the balls were underinflated. The footballs were tested, and it turned out to be true. New balls were used for the second half of the game.\n\nPeople have nicknamed the mystery \"deflategate.\" The big question, now, is how the footballs came to be deflated. Was it an accident, or a case of cheating?\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick said that his team did not do anything wrong. He spoke to reporters on Saturday afternoon. \"We feel like we followed the rules of the game,\" he said. \"We try to do everything right.\"\n\n## Loss Of Air Pressure\n\nAt first, Belichick said that he had no idea why the balls were deflated. On Saturday, however, he had a guess.\n\nHe blamed the weather. He said a drop in temperature could have caused the change in air pressure of the footballs. If you take a ball from a warm place to a cool place, it loses air pressure. The balls were inflated in a warm room by NFL officials. Then they were used in the game, which was on a cold day.\n\nHe also explained that the Patriots had looked into how they prepare balls before each game.\n\nTeams are allowed to rub new footballs to break them in after they are inflated. It helps make them softer and easier to grip. Belichick suggested that the friction caused by rubbing the balls could have raised their temperature, which would raise the air pressure inside. After they were taken out of the warm room, there would be an even bigger drop in temperature, and a bigger drop in air pressure.\n\nHe admitted that this was just an idea. He does not know for sure. \"I'm not a scientist. I'm not an expert,\" Belichick said. \"I'm just telling you what I know.\"\n\n## Team Of Cheaters?\n\nNot everyone believes his explanation, however. People have been arguing about what really happened since \"deflategate\" began.\n\nAfter the game, news reports came out that the Patriots' footballs had been deflated. The NFL is trying to figure out how it happened.\n\nPeople began asking if Belichick had deflated the balls on purpose. Others were suspicious of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Like Belichick, Brady denied having done anything against the rules. He said that he didn't know how the footballs were deflated.\n\n\"Deflategate\" has led some people to call the Patriots a team of cheaters. Belichick defended his players, however. He does not think that his players did anything wrong.\n\nIn his opinion, the Patriots are the best team and deserve to go to the Super Bowl. \"I know that because I've been with them every day. And I'm proud of this team,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tThe New England Patriots played a championship game against the Indianapolis Colts on Jan. 19. The Colts told the National Football League (NFL) that the footballs the Patriots were using did not feel right. The footballs were tested at halftime and were discovered to be low on air. People refer to it as \"Deflategate.\"\n\nLess air in the footballs makes them easier to throw and catch. The Patriots defeated the Colts 45-7 and went on to win the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIn May, the football league found that Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady probably knew that the air had been let out of the footballs. It suspended Brady for the first four games of this coming season without pay. Brady appealed and asked the league to reconsider.\n\nOn Tuesday, football Commissioner Roger Goodell ruled that the original punishment should stand. Brady will have to sit out the first four games of the season.\n\n## NFL Says Brady Blocked Investigation\n\nNow Brady will likely go to court and ask a judge to let him play.\n\nGoodell revealed a new piece of information Tuesday. Brady had his cellphone destroyed shortly before meeting with the NFL's investigators about Deflategate.\n\nIn his ruling, Goodell wrote that the evidence showed that Brady participated in the scheme to let air out of the balls. Team workers were the ones who actually let the air out. Deflating the balls too much is cheating, according to the NFL's rules.\n\nGoodell also said that Brady blocked the investigation by destroying his cellphone. Brady knew it contained information the investigators had asked for, Goodell said.\n\nThe football commissioner said he has great respect for Brady's achievements in football and in the community. Nevertheless, he concluded that Brady's actions harmed the honesty of the game. It has also affected people's confidence in professional football.\n\n## \"The Decision Is Wrong,\" Says Yee, Brady's Agent\n\nBrady's agent, Don Yee, criticized Goodell's ruling. Yee said Goodell's decision \"is deeply disappointing.\"\n\nYee said that Brady gave Goodell electronic information that showed he was not involved. Goodell ignored the evidence, Yee said.\n\nYee pointed out that no quarterback was ever suspended for four games because of deflated footballs. Goodell's decision could change the outcome of the first four games of the football season. A less experienced quarterback will have to replace Brady. \"The decision is wrong,\" Yee said.\n\nBrady and NFL Players Association (NFLPA) are expected to ask a judge to let Brady play. The NFLPA is a group that represents the football players.\n\nThe NFL made the first legal move Tuesday. It filed a case in New York to attempt to have the suspension upheld.\n\nThose connected to the case on the players side said they believe Brady and the union have a strong case. They said Brady has an excellent chance of winning.\n\n## Union May Say Rule Applies To Teams, Not Players\n\nThe NFLPA has several possible arguments. The union can say that there is not enough proof against Brady. It can argue that the rules for handling footballs apply to teams, not to individual players. It can say Brady was given a punishment that no player has ever been given before.\n\nThe league and the NFLPA tried to come to an agreement. Not much progress was made, though. The NFLPA did not think Brady should sit out any games. In contrast, the football league insisted that he had to be punished.\n\nMany in the league supported the full four-game suspension. They agreed with Commissioner Goodell's decision. \"I think he has to stay with the same thing,\" an official with one NFL team said.\n\nThe Patriots reported to their training camp on Wednesday. If Brady cannot play, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo would open the season. Garoppolo began playing professional football just last year. He completed 19 of 27 passes for 182 yards. He threw for one touchdown and had no interceptions.\n\nThe Patriots will play the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL's first game of the season on Sept. 10.'"

            "text": "\tOKLAHOMA CITY - Kevin Durant is now officially basketball's best player. In accepting his first Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, Durant made a point of sharing the honor: He thanked those who made it possible.\n\nIn a soul-baring speech that lasted more than 25 minutes, Durant fought back tears several times. He thanked each of his Oklahoma City Thunder teammates. He thanked his coaches, his trainers, the team's owners - and he thanked his family.\n\nDurant's emotional speech ended with heartfelt thanks to his mother, Wanda Pratt. Durant praised her for the sacrifices she had made. And he thanked her for the encouragement she provided while raising Durant and his brother.\n\n\"You made us believe,\" Durant said to Pratt, who was at the ceremony in Oklahoma. \"Kept us off the street, put clothes on our backs, food on the table. When you didn't eat, you made sure we ate. You sacrificed for us. You're the real MVP.\"\n\n## His Mom Got Them Through Tough Times\n\nDurant, who was raised near Washington, D.C., explained that Pratt was a single mother with two boys. Times were tough while he was growing up. Still, Pratt always thought something better was ahead.\n\nAs he accepted the MVP award, Durant said that to appreciate moments like these, he often looks back to his early years. That way he won't take anything for granted.\n\n\"One of the best memories I had is when we moved into our first apartment,\" he said as tears streamed down Pratt's face. \"No bed, no furniture, and we just all sat in the living room and hugged each other, 'cause that's when we all thought we made it.\"\n\nHe's really made it now. The young man who said he was told he \"wasn't supposed to be here\" won the National Basketball Association's top honor Tuesday. Miami's LeBron James finished second. Blake Griffin of the Los Angeles Clippers was third.\n\n## Respect All Around\n\nDurant, 25, said winning the award almost didn't seem real. At one point, as he thanked his teammates, he stopped and said, \"I don't know why I'm crying so much.\"\n\nDuring his speech Durant was humble and heartfelt. But he also drew some laughs.\n\n\"I could walk in and have a terrible day and I could see Hasheem (Thabeet) smiling at me, at 7-foot-3 with small pants on,\" he said. \"That would change my day.\"\n\nDurant expressed respect for all his teammates. The more experienced players, he said, challenged him to do better. The rookies inspired him to do things the right way because they look up to him.\n\n\"When you've got people behind you,\" Durant said, \"you can do whatever\" you set out to do.\n\nDurant won his fourth scoring crown in five years by averaging 32 points. The 6-foot-9 forward helped the Thunder achieve a record of 59 wins to 23 losses. That gave the team the second-best record in the league.\n\n\"He's basically put himself in front of everybody else in the league,\" teammate Russell Westbrook said. Durant, Russell said, has \"shown that he's the best player in the world.\"\n\nJames agreed, saying he had \"much respect\" for Durant, and that Durant \"deserves\" the award. \"He had a big-time MVP season.\"\n\n## Skill Combined With Hard Work\n\nThis season Durant played 41 games in a row in which he scored at least 25 points. That scoring run was the third-longest streak in NBA history.\n\nDurant scored at least 40 points 14 times. He also averaged 7.4 rebounds and a career-high 5.5 assists.\n\nTeammate Nick Collison said he and fellow players may sometimes take Durant's skill and hard work for granted. \"To be able to stay on for long periods of time - have to cut hard, catch the ball in the right spot and defend on the other end - is tough to do. To be able to do that shows that he has an edge to him. He doesn't take a night off.\"\n\nDurant himself doesn't take anything for granted, though.\n\n\"I put in so much work and so many people helped me,\" he said. \"I feel like we all won it. Our equipment guy gave me a hug today and said, 'This is my first MVP,' and I thought about that. And I said, 'Yeah, this is our first MVP.' I couldn't have done it without the teammates, without the trainer - everybody. We all just did this together.\"'"

            "text": "\tSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - For 150 years, there have been no clocks in baseball. But that could change soon.\n\nBaseball is the only major sport without time limits. It could soon add clocks to time pitches, substitutions, and breaks between innings. Major League Baseball (MLB) is testing new clock rules in the Arizona Fall League (AFL), a lower league it runs.\n\nIf players take too long at any of those things, umpires can charge pitchers with balls and batters with strikes. The rule changes are meant to speed up the game and make it more interesting for young people.\n\nFrank Kremblas, a manager in the AFL, said major league baseball games are usually the slowest. He said the AFL was changing its rules just as an experiment.\n\n## Today's Games Take Over Three Hours\n\nBaseball games take longer than they used to. An average game in 1950 lasted 2 hours, 23 minutes. The average game took more than three hours this season.\n\nGames aren't just longer. They are slower too. In 2000, teams scored an average of 5.14 runs each game. Since then scoring has decreased, with teams scoring an average of 4.07 runs each game this year. There are more strikeouts than before.\n\nIf fewer runs are scored and fewer balls hit, what's taking so long?\n\nBatters are more patient, waiting for the perfect pitch. Coaches make more substitutions than they used to. New video reviews slow things down too. Players often adjust their equipment and take practice swings.\n\nThe fastest pitchers, like Mark Buehrle of the Toronto Blue Jays and Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals, take about 18 seconds between pitches. The slowest pitchers take more than 25 seconds on average. Edinson Volquez of the Pittsburgh Pirates averaged 25.3 seconds between pitches, the fourth-slowest time this year.\n\n## Clocks For Pitchers And Batters\n\nBatters also slow games down. Hanley Ramirez of the Los Angeles Dodgers takes 28.1 seconds between pitches. He was the slowest batter in the major leagues this year. His teammate Yasiel Puig takes 26.7 seconds, which tied for third. Dodgers games took an average of 3:14 this season.\n\nThe AFL clock rules were announced in early October to address these problems. MLB officials want to use them as an experiment to speed up baseball games.\n\nThe biggest change is the pitch clock. Pitchers must throw the ball within 20 seconds or receive an automatic ball. Batters are supposed to stay in the batter's box during their at-bats.\n\nYou can only step out if you if you swing, said fall league player Josh Bell.\n\nPitchers have to throw the first pitch of a new inning within 2 minutes, 5 seconds after the end of the last one. Batters must be in the batter's box within 1:45. Pitching changes can take no longer than 2:30. Teams are also limited to three timeouts. Pitchers can give an intentional walk by saying so rather than throwing four pitches.\n\n## They Did Speed Things Up A Bit\n\nThe rules are enforced at Salt River Fields, the only AFL ballpark outfitted with the clocks. There are five digital clocks that count down the various times.\n\nHaving the clocks there changed the game, Bell said.\n\n\"So you're trying to pick up the ball, the lights are flashing right behind,\" he said. \"It's definitely a little bit different.\"\n\nThe rules seem to have worked. Through Oct. 24, nine-inning games under the new rules averaged 2 hours, 20 minutes, while nine-inning games without clock rules averaged 2:49. The average AFL game took 2:51 last year.\n\nIt is still unclear if any of the clock rules will move to the major leagues. The game can only speed up so much, and shorter isn't always better, some say.\n\nPittsburgh Pirates manager Clint Hurdle shared that feeling in September. \"If it's all about a clock,\" he said, \"go watch another sport.\"'"

            "text": "\tRIO DE JANEIRO - The Summer Olympics are held every four years in a different city. In 2016, they will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Recently, the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, visited the place that will become Olympic Park. She promised that the games would be a great success - or, as she put it, \"the Olympics of all Olympics.\"\n\nThe president said the Olympics would benefit from Brazil's experience organizing the World Cup soccer tournament. The final match of the Cup took place in Rio in July 2014. Brazil's handling of the Cup drew widespread praise.\n\nHowever, memories of what happened in Rio during the buildup to the Cup terrify some Brazilians. The people worried most are those who live in poor communities known as favelas.\n\n## Neighborhoods Disrupted\n\nThe World Cup went very smoothly - except for those who live in the favelas. Their neighborhoods were disrupted. They are worried they will see the same kinds of problems again during preparations for the Olympics.\n\nEvents like the World Cup or the Olympics bring a huge number of tourists from all over the world. New stadiums, buildings and roads are often built. Whole neighborhoods can go through big changes - even if the people living there don't want them.\n\nOne of the favelas, Favela do Metro, is located just 300 yards from the Maracana soccer stadium. World Cup games were held at Maracana. Olympic games will be held there as well.\n\nPeople in Favela do Metro say they were mistreated during preparations for the World Cup.\n\n## Knocking Down Houses\n\nCity officials wanted to build a new parking lot in the favela, near Maracana stadium. In 2010, the city started knocking down houses. Many families were forced to leave.\n\nThen, with no reason given, the city just stopped. No new parking lot was ever built.\n\nFor the people who remain in Favela do Metro, things are now much worse than they ever were. The city seems to have forgotten about them. Rats roam freely. Mounds of garbage and old furniture pile up.\n\nSome houses are still standing, but are surrounded by houses that have been destroyed.\n\nThe neighborhood now looks like it has been bombed. People have no running water.\n\nA desperate cry for help is scrawled on one wall: \"We are not animals to be discarded in this way.\"\n\n## Officials See Things Differently\n\nCity officials describe events in Favela do Metro differently.\n\nOne official said that people agreed to leave and had plenty of notice. Many were moved to new housing, she said. Others who gave up their homes got money from the city, she added.\n\nHowever, many deny those claims. They say the people of Favela do Metro were given very little time to leave and many were mistreated by the police.\n\nFor those who remain in Favela do Metro, things are only getting worse. Barbara Cabral Souza, age 38, says that city officials have yet to offer her a way out.\n\nThe shops and jobs that were once here are gone. There is no police presence, and drug dealers have become her neighbors.\n\n\"We are prisoners inside our own city,\" she said.'"

Then Sierra McKenzie, a fourth-year student, told her team, \"Remember your stuff. You all know what to do.\"\n\nThe music starts, and their smiles widen. Once they start dancing, everything else is blocked out.\n\n## Seriously Spreading Spirit\n\nThe McCluer Pommies take their job of spreading team spirit seriously. The 12 teens go to McCluer High School in Florissant, Missouri. Their town is near Ferguson, where an unarmed African-American teenager named Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer over the summer. Brown's death caused many protests all across Ferguson.\n\nPractices were canceled because of the protests. What happened also hurt their ability to raise money to pay for uniforms, dance camps and other expenses.\n\nBut in middle of all of the challenges, there have been victories.\n\nThe team has done well. They have won two first places at a recent dance competition against 40 teams from other schools.\n\n\"That's a team to watch out for - that's the reputation we want,\" said longtime coach Rega Wesley-Stewart. \"We just keep pushing.\"\n\n## They Learn Once They Join\n\nUnlike other dance teams, most of the Pommies have never had any formal training, or taken dance classes before. They learn the dance routines once they join the team.\n\n\"In many ways, we start from scratch every year,\" said Wesley-Stewart. She also teaches math at McCluer.\n\nThe girls have to try out to earn a spot on the team. They go through interviews and parent meetings. The cost of being a Pommie is not cheap, although the area is far from rich. A new Pommie this year paid nearly $1,000.\n\n## The Mission Is Important\n\nStudents say being a Pommie is an honor and a lot of work. The Pommies' other coach, Jackie Allen, says that the girls must be committed to the team and their studies.\n\n\"A McCluer Pommie shall provide a spirit-promoting service, be loyal, have high morals and standards,\" said the team's website. She must \"be a good example in and out of school, and develop self-discipline and confidence,\" it added.\n\nThat mission is important, Wesley-Stewart said, especially because of what happened in Ferguson. In November, a grand jury decided that there would be no charges against the police officer in the Brown case. A grand jury is a group of people who listen to a case. They hear from witnesses and look at evidence, or proof, of what happened.\n\n\"There are good kids out there and good parents,\" Wesley-Stewart said.\n\n## Canceled Practices, Fundraisers\n\nIn the summer after Brown's death and again after the grand jury decision, protests broke out in Ferguson. Some of the protests were violent. People blocked streets and broke windows.\n\nBecause of the violence, the school canceled classes and after-school activities and practices. The girls had to miss practice less than two weeks before a major competition in St. Louis.\n\nA planned fundraiser in December had to be canceled. The girls had trouble selling tickets. People did not feel comfortable going to the area at night because of the violence.\n\nThe girls have sold pizza, cups and spirit wear. The team is trying other ideas, such as selling ads on its website, but it has not been easy.\n\n\"A lot of people don't have the money,\" said Victoria Mantia, a high school junior.\n\n## \"I Just Want It To Keep Going\"\n\nAt the basketball game was a former Pommie, Aaries Wadsworth. She goes to the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Wadsworth came to see the team and her former coaches before heading back to school.\n\n\"This was everything for me in high school,\" Wadsworth said. \"These are a bunch of really intelligent woman doing something good for themselves and the school.\"\n\nThe girls say they work harder every year and become more confident. Some said Wesley-Stewart helped them get their grades up. Others said the experience also will stay with them after high school.\n\n\"I just want it to keep going,\" said Pommie Jerianna Harden.'"

Instead, they want to hear more about FIFA.\n\nFIFA is short for Federation Internationale de Football Association. It is the organization in charge of soccer all over the world. FIFA is similar to American sports leagues like the NBA or the NFL. But its teams are in about 200 different countries.\n\n## Seven Arrests Last Week\n\nOn Wednesday, seven FIFA employees were arrested and charged with making money illegally. The U.S. Department of Justice says the problems have been going on for many years.\n\nSwitzerland is also taking a closer look at FIFA. The Swiss government wants to find out whether FIFA officials were secretly given money when they were deciding where to host the next World Cups.\n\nThese issues are also creating problems for companies that partner with FIFA. Coca-Cola, Visa and Adidas all pay to advertise with FIFA. Now they are being asked to speak out about how FIFA does business.\n\nCobus de Swardt leads an organization called Transparency International. His group tries to make sure companies are honest with the public.\n\n## Advertisers Need Honest FIFA Leaders\n\nDe Swardt says that FIFA's advertising partners give them millions of dollars and they have a right to know where the money is going. He says they also have a responsibility to make sure it is not being used for anything illegal.\n\nHe hopes Wednesday's arrests will be a \"wake-up call\" for FIFA's partners. He says partners should not wait to see what happens. They should demand change now.\n\nDe Swardt recommended that FIFA delay its presidential election. He also discouraged Sepp Blatter from running again. At the time, Blatter was just finishing his fourth term as president.\n\n\"FIFA needs a new start,\" said de Swardt. He pointed out all of the problems that Blatter had not been able to stop or prevent.\n\nVoting took place on Friday as scheduled. Blatter was re-elected for a fifth term.\n\n## Lots Of Money At Stake\n\nPartners like Adidas, Visa and McDonald's have spoken out about the FIFA arrests. So far, none of them have been very harsh. They mainly talked about how doing the right thing is important to them.\n\nAdvertising expert Nigel Currie says FIFA's partners might be scared to say something stronger. There is just too much for companies to lose. FIFA's partners do not want to end such powerful relationships. Big companies make lots of money from having their names on FIFA jerseys. Their TV commercials during games help them get customers.\n\nAlso, lots of rival companies would be glad to take over for one of FIFA's partners. For example, if Coca-Cola stopped working with FIFA, Pepsi could take its spot, and try to get its customers.\n\n## FIFA Can't Ignore Sponsors\n\nThat does not mean FIFA's partners will just sit back quietly and do nothing, though. Last week, three FIFA sponsors told FIFA they want to see changes in the country of Qatar where they said the workers who are preparing for the 2022 World Cup are not being treated properly.\n\nCurrie says companies that partner with FIFA should work together to get its attention. He thinks they should speak with one loud, strong voice. Sticking together will be the best way to get FIFA to make changes.\n\nFIFA's partners provide almost a third of the organization's multibillion dollar revenues. Currie says that is one of the main reasons why FIFA can't just ignore their concerns.'"

That did not mean the football players got along.\n\nIncognito sent threatening text messages to his teammate, said two people who knew about the situation. The messages were also racist, they said.\n\nThe people agreed to speak to The Associated Press only if they would not be named.\n\nMartin left the team a week ago because of emotional problems.\n\n## Incognito Suspended Indefinitely\n\nIncognito is a longtime player known for dirty play. He was suspended indefinitely Sunday by coach Joe Philbin for his treatment of Martin.\n\nThe team and NFL are investigating whether Martin was [bullied](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying). Philbin said Dolphins owner Stephen Ross asked Commissioner Roger Goodell for help. The players union is also looking into the matter.\n\nAgents for the two players didn't respond to requests for comment. Martin is with his family in Los Angeles for counseling. He stormed out of the team's training headquarters on Oct. 28 after being the victim of a joke during a team meal, media reports said.\n\nThe 319-pound Incognito, a ninth-year pro, is white. The 312-pound Martin, who is in his second NFL season, is black. For much of the season, they've played side by side.\n\nIt's unclear whether the coaches had any idea of bullying between the players before Martin left the team. Philbin did not answer a question about the locker-room culture.\n\nThe Dolphins beat Cincinnati on Thursday. Then they had three days off while the Martin story grew. They returned to practice Monday. Afterward, nearly 100 reporters and cameramen were in their locker room.\n\n## A Line That Shouldn't Be Crossed\n\nTeammates praised both Incognito and Martin. They said they were sorry both were absent from the team. But they also said it was time to get on with business.\n\n\"The only thing affecting us is we can't even get dressed,\" said receiver Mike Wallace, looking at all the reporters.\n\nWallace said he found Incognito to be intense but a good teammate. Newcomer Bryant McKinnie agreed.\n\n\"When I got here, he was a guy who had everybody laughing and told jokes,\" said McKinnie. He is also a lineman and joined the team two weeks ago. \"I didn't really see the side being portrayed right now.\"\n\nHarsh treatment of young players has a long history in sports. Still, Incognito's treatment of Martin raised questions about whether coaches or teammates should have stopped it.\n\n\"It's not a thin line. It's pretty obvious stuff that shouldn't be crossed,\" Tennessee Titans cornerback Jason McCourty said.\n\nArizona Cardinals defensive tackle Darnell Dockett said he was glad the Dolphins took action against Incognito.\n\n\"Especially when you try to bully a guy. That's so classless,\" Dockett said. \"His whole makeup is to play dirty and hurt guys. Everybody knows that. I just don't understand how he got away with it for so long. I think the NFL really needs to buckle down on it now, because it's bigger than trying to hurt other guys. You're trying to hurt guys on your team mentally, which sometimes can actually be worse than hurting someone physically.\"\n\n## Some Players \"Are Just Punks\"\n\nIncognito posted several tweets saying he wanted his name cleared before he was suspended.\n\nIncognito has long had a reputation of being among the NFL's dirtiest players.\n\n\"There's certain people out there who are just punks, and he wants to be that kind of guy,\" former Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions defensive end Lawrence Jackson said Monday. \"But because he's a lineman, he gets away with a lot of stuff that people don't see. Incognito is way worse than anybody I ever played against.\"\n\nHowever, there have been fewer such complaints since Incognito joined the Dolphins in 2010.\n\nLast year he was voted by the league's players into the Pro Bowl for the first time. He was the co-winner of the Dolphins' Good Guy Award, given to the team's most cooperative player by the local media. He also won frequent praise from Dolphins coaches for his leadership. This year he was voted by teammates to serve as a member of the Dolphins' player council.\n\nFor the first six games this year, Incognito and Martin were the two players protecting quarterback Ryan Tannehill's blind side. Their troubled relationship may help explain his NFL-high 35 sacks.'"

            "title": "Does adding extra padding make football helmets safer? Experts split",
            "text": "\tCHICAGO - The National Football League on Sept. 5 settled a lawsuit accusing it of not doing enough to prevent brain injuries. But there is still much confusion over those injuries, known as [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions). The Guardian is just one example.\n\nThe Guardian is a padded cap that is strapped around the outside of a football helmet. Its aim is to lower the force of collisions when players crash into one another. The product has been available for two years. It doesn't promise to prevent concussions. Nonetheless, Elmhurst College players who wear the cap during practice say it has made a big difference.\n\n\"It gets rid of those little small hits you get in practice,\" said player Nick Spracklen, 20. \"It keeps your head fresh, keeps those headaches away. You leave practice without a headache, your whole day is better.\"\n\nBut as football season begins, safety questions remain. Scientists, companies and lawyers continue to argue over the best way to protect players from head injuries.\n\n## Concussions Hard To Predict\n\nMuch of the arguing is now focused on the helmet. The former players who settled with the NFL are still suing Riddell, maker of the league's official helmet. They claim the company sold an unsafe product.\n\nInto this storm have stepped a few small companies that sell add-on helmet pads, which they say are a way to increase protection. So far experts are split: Some believe that extra padding makes sense. Others say stricter testing is needed.\n\nFor years, the way football helmets were tested was pretty straighforward. Companies strap one to a dummy head fitted with sensors. Then, they slam it into a post at different speeds. If the tests show a fractured skull would be unlikely, the helmet passes.\n\nSuch tests are good at showing a helmet's power to prevent major damage to the head. What they don't say much about is the likelihood of getting a concussion. No one has figured out how to predict that. This is because of the injury's complexity.\n\nAnd it also is due to individual differences that influence whether someone ends up with a concussion. These range from a person's genetics to whether they have had previous blows to the head.\n\n## Reducing A Hit By 33 Percent\n\nThe uncertainty has created an opportunity for companies that say they have found new ways to give athletes better protection.\n\nThe Guardian is made by Georgia-based POC Ventures. Its inventor, Lee Hanson, claims it reduces the force of a hit by 33 percent.\n\nHanson is careful to say that the Guardian can't prevent concussions. But, he said, \"common sense\" strongly suggests that more padding will help players.\n\nRob Vito is taking a different approach. His company, Unequal Technologies, sells pads that are attached inside a helmet. They strengthen a helmet's inner cushioning, which he mockingly calls \"couch foam.\"\n\nJohn Thorne is coach of the football team at North Central College in Naperville. Some of his players started using the Unequal pads this year. However, it's still too soon to tell how well they work.\n\n\"I've been coaching football for 45 years, and I'm always looking for a way to make the game safer,\" he said. \"We're hoping this is a good technology. It seems to make some sense.\"\n\n## Unknown How Much Pads Help\n\nBiomedical engineer Steven Rowson helped develop a safety rating system for football helmets. According to him, the idea behind the new products does indeed make sense.\n\n\"Adding padding is going to reduce acceleration to the head,\" he said. \"When you reduce acceleration to the head, you're going to reduce the risk of concussion.\"\n\nBut it still not really known just how much the pads can help.\n\nHanson said several hundred teams use the Guardian, and he was confident most will want to continue. Elmhurst College is one of them.\n\nCoach Joe Adam plans to keep Guardians on his players' helmets. He said the shells have proven their worth.\n\n\"I can just go by results,\" he said. \"In 21 practices, we've had one concussion. I would think that's on the lower side for teams in our area.\"'"

            "text": "\tChris Kemoeatu needed an operation to get a new kidney. He got the kidney from his brother, a former Baltimore Ravens' football player, three weeks ago.\n\nKemoeatu, 31, played seven years for the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Ravens and Steelers are bitter rivals.\n\n\"Everyone jokes about me having a Ravens' kidney,\" Kemoeatu said. \"But hey, I can live with that.\"\n\nHe'll have to.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kemoeatu (pronounced key-moy-AH-too) and his brother Ma'ake (ma-AH-kay) spoke at the University of Maryland Medical Center. The hospital is where they had the surgery to transfer the kidney.\n\n## An Uncommon Event\n\nSuch kidney transplants between family members are not uncommon. However,  this was likely the first one between players linked to both sides of one of the NFL's biggest rivalries.\n\n\"I'm a Raven and Chris is a Steeler but for this procedure, we had to come together,\" said Ma'ake, 35. He was a starting defensive tackle on the Ravens' 2012 Super Bowl championship team. He has one championship ring. Chris, an offensive guard who retired in 2011, has two Super Bowl rings - and one of his brother's kidneys.\n\nMa'ake has noticed the difference in what the brothers have collected.\n\n\"I figure he owes me a lot of steak dinners,\" Ma'ake said.\n\nChris had battled painful kidney problems since he was young. He quit football three years ago to address his worsening health. A transplant seemed to be the best bet and tests at UMMC showed his eldest brother was a 99 percent match.\n\nMa'ake stepped up.\n\n\"I'm the oldest of seven kids and it's my responsibility to take care of the rest,\" he said. \"If my siblings need blood, it will be my blood. If they need a kidney, it will be my kidney. We both stopped our careers for this, but I'd have done it even if I was a rookie with the Ravens. I have to lead by example.\"\n\n## Surgery Would Be Challenging\n\nThe operation was set for July. However, just before the surgery, a routine test showed that Chris had heart trouble. He had a major heart operation instead of kidney surgery. While recovering, Chris underwent dialysis at UMMC to prepare for the kidney transplant. Dialysis replaces the work of the kidneys to help clean a person's blood.\n\n\"There were days when I drove him to dialysis when Chris looked at me and said, 'I don't think I can do this anymore,'\" Ma'ake recalled. \"I said, 'Bro, muster up all the strength you've got. We're gonna get through this.'\"\n\nBoth men checked into the hospital weighing 345 pounds. Their weight was a challenge for surgeons.\n\n\"Chris and Ma'ake aren't your average-sized people,\" said Dr. David Leeser, chief of kidney and pancreas transplantation. He said that Ma'ake would medically have been considered too heavy to be healthy. A lot of hospitals would not have let Ma'ake give up his kidney, Leeser said. \"He has a 22-inch neck, which is the waist size for a lot of women. But when we measured his body fat it came out average for men in the U.S.\"\n\nIn a 2-1/2-hour operation, Leeser removed one of Ma'ake's kidneys. The organ measured 13 centimeters, about 3 cm. more than average.\n\n\"It was the largest normal kidney I've ever seen in my life,\" said Dr. Stephen Bartlett, the hospital's surgeon-in-chief who performed Chris' operation. \"I felt like somebody had thrown me a small football.\"\n\nThe five-hour operation went off without a problem.\n\n## Not Quite Ready For The Film Version\n\nSeveral hours later, Chris was awake in his room when Ma'ake walked in.\n\n\"I told him, 'There's no better gift you can give a brother,'\" Chris said.\n\nBoth men received get-wells from their teams: Ma'ake, from the Ravens' Haloti Ngata and Torrey Smith, among others, and Chris, from Pittsburgh's Hines Ward and Heath Miller.\n\nThe brothers will remain here for several months, then return home to Hawaii. They own a sports fitness center on the island.\n\nChris will not return to football, while Ma'ake isn't sure.\n\n\"It's been a tough year,\" said Chris, who wore a Steelers cap as he spoke to a group of reporters. \"I've experienced all I wanted to in football. I've played in three Super Bowls and been blessed to watch my brother play in another.\"\n\nMa'ake said he would \"love to play\" and cited one player, linebacker Paul Kruger, who is playing with only one kidney. But business interests and family ties come first. He will never forget the operation.\n\n\"They told me they have the whole thing on film,\" Ma'ake said. \"I've watched a lot of game films, but I'm not quite ready to see this yet.\"'"

            "text": "\tPARIS - Parents like Eric and Isabelle Nizard are angry. The French government is trying out a new program on their 9-year-old son, Sacha. It's the latest change in French public education. Sacha must now attend school on Wednesdays.\n\nBeginning in September, Wednesday was no longer an official day off in France. It was a traditional break in the middle of the week for elementary school students. But now, French children have to show up for class Monday through Friday.\n\nThe Nizards complain that Sacha feels a bit lost. Their Tuesday evenings have been ruined. The family used to go out to dinner or watch TV without worrying about class the next morning. Sacha's guitar lessons used to be on Wednesdays. Now they are sandwiched into his Friday lunch period.\n\n\"We weren't asked for our opinion. This was imposed upon us,\" said Isabelle, 41. \"They changed the course of our life without asking us for our opinion!\"\n\n## Fewer, But Longer, School Days\n\nThe new school week has sparked protests from teachers and letters from parents. The unpopular government of President Francois Hollande is struggling to defend it.\n\nOfficials say it is because of a serious problem. French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year. So educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day.\n\nIn other words, fewer school days mean much longer ones. Children as young as 6 stay in class late in the afternoon, until skies go dark and parents get off work.\n\nAdding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to lighten that burden. The declining scores of French students is becoming a real concern. About a quarter of the country's elementary schools have already changed their calendars. The rest are expected to do so next year.\n\nThe reason French schoolchildren have had Wednesdays off is an accident of history.\n\nFrance created its public education system in the late 19th century. The government gave one day a week to the Catholic Church for children to attend bible classes. Many schools stayed open on Saturday mornings. But in 2008, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy decided that a four-day school week was enough.\n\n## A Crazy Quilt Of A Week\n\nVincent Peillon is France's education minister. He says he feels comfortable with the change. He believes that it is in the best interest of the nation's young. But he has been challenged by the public. Parents claim the shift has been made poorly. Even those who admit that the old system had problems say so.\n\nIn Paris, parents are mad. Instead of school days of equal length, the city's new school week is a crazy quilt. No two days in a row end at the same time.\n\nAnd moms and dads feel cheated. Many have arranged their workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their kids.\n\n\"We have this midweek day off which helps the kids relax, to establish their own rhythm, to stay up a little longer (on Tuesdays) with us,\" said Eric, Sacha's father. It helps make the next morning easier, he added.\n\nSome children do attend church school. But today's parents aren't as religious. Many have found Wednesdays useful for their kids' music lessons, sports practice and other non-school activities. These get little attention in the French education system. Businesses have sprung up to serve the Wednesday desires of middle-class families, offering programs for extra help for kids in things like English.\n\n## A Call For A National Strike\n\nIsabelle helped put together a letter from people in her rich neighborhood demanding that the mayor of Paris stop the new school week. It hasn't succeeded.\n\nThe parents group she leads is now urging members to pull their kids out of school next Wednesday in protest. Others across France are doing the same. Teachers and other school workers have called for a national strike the following day. A strike is when people stay home from work to protest something they don't like.\n\nRearranging the school calendar is one way officials are trying to fix French education. France's level of education compared with other countries has been declining over the last 10 years.\n\nBy the time they turn 15, nearly two-fifths of French students have had to repeat a grade. That's three times the average of most well-off countries. About one-sixth drop out or finish school without a degree.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - There are no nets on the tennis courts at DeForest Park in Long Beach. Tennis balls are nowhere in sight. This evening, people are playing with a different kind of ball.\n\nThey are playing a game called futsal. It is a squeezed-down, faster type of soccer.\n\nThe goals are spray painted on the fence that surrounds the court. Shots whiz by like cars on a freeway.\n\nEnglish and Spanish blend. Players chant \"Corre! Corre!\" (\"Run!\") and \"Mira! Mira!\" (\"Look!\").\n\nThe matches on this concrete court are quick. The first team to score wins. Losers retreat to wooden benches as the next challenger goes to play.\n\n## Rolling Into Parks\n\nArturo Sanchez, 20, is in his element. When Sanchez moved to a side of town with more Latinos, he fell in love with soccer.\n\nDuring the day, the soccer field down the road at DeForest Park was taken over by youth leagues. When night fell, the unlighted field was dark. The tennis courts, though, were still lit.\n\nSo, several years ago, Sanchez and a group of friends turned the tennis courts into soccer courts. They did what Brazilians and other Latin Americans started doing nearly a century ago: they turned any flat, open space into a soccer field.\n\nExisting soccer fields are beaten down from being used so much. There is no open space in city neighborhoods to build more. So futsal has rolled into parks across the nation. The game has met the growing demand of soccer-lovers in their teens and 20s.\n\nNearly every player prefers to play on grass. But futsal courts are seen as the best choice right now. Also, building a futsal court costs about $25,000. A real soccer field would cost 10 times as much.\n\nParks officials talk about courts meant for tennis, basketball or volleyball. Those areas have seen more soccer balls bounced on them than anything else in the past few years, they say. This is another sign of how the nation's growing Latino population is reshaping cities and other areas.\n\nThe number of places to play in the Los Angeles region is expected to triple to 45 during the next two years.\n\n## Futsal's Fancy Footwork\n\nFutsal is normally played with teams of five rather than 11 as in soccer. This increases the amount of times each player kicks the ball. The ball is also smaller and heavier. It rolls faster and needs to be kicked harder.\n\n\"You have to know how to pass really fast, how to attack in small spaces and how to defend all at once,\" Sanchez said.\n\nSoccer players may let the ball soar a long distance and rely on their own speed to attack the goal. In futsal, players rely on footwork as they weave past one another.\n\nTap the ball too hard and it will sail out of bounds; fail to give it enough zip and a defender is there to steal it away. There's not enough space to outrace another player for a misplaced ball.\n\n\"Here, I can experiment and see if I can do these new tricks quickly in a small space,\" Sanchez said. If he can make the other team's players look bad in futsal, then \"it's easier on the big field.\"\n\n## Playing Pickup Games\n\nSoccer experts say that children improve at soccer more quickly if they play futsal. That draws some high school soccer players to DeForest during the off-season. They try to play like international soccer legends such as Brazil's Ronaldinho and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo. Last year, the U.S. Soccer Federation began making some of its academy teams play futsal during the off-season.\n\nFutsal is also different from indoor soccer. Indoor soccer fields typically look like a hockey rink, and kicks that bounce off the walls are allowed. Futsal has an out-of-bounds line just like soccer. Sneakers or running shoes are worn instead of cleats.\n\nLos Angeles County opened its first futsal fields last summer. Parents play with toddlers during the day. Teenagers come through in the afternoon. Adults, many of them Spanish-speaking immigrants, play pickup games in the evenings.\n\nCounty officials said it was necessary to add futsal fields. They make community parks work for today's demand for soccer-like activities.\n\nIn Long Beach, Sanchez no longer needs to tear down tennis nets; the city has done it for him. Three of the four tennis courts at DeForest Park were made into futsal fields last summer. '"

            "text": "\tMadison school students are \"gaga\" for gaga ball. The Wheaton, Illinois, students crowd around the game at recess, cheering on the players and waiting for their turn.\n\nGaga is not a new game, but recently, it has become very popular. Some call it a gentle form of dodgeball, played with one foam ball. Players do not need to be strong athletes to do well. \"It puts everybody on an even playing field,\" Madison physical education teacher Joe Cortesi says.\n\nGaga ball is believed to have come from Israel. Located in the Middle East, on the continent of Asia, Israel is a country of about 8 million people.\n\nGaga means \"touch, touch\" in Hebrew, the national language of Israel. It has been played in the United States for about 40 years.\n\n## A Touching Start\n\nThe game is played inside a hexagonal or octagonal pit. The pit is up to 25 feet wide with walls only about 30 inches high. The surface must be flat.\n\nThe number of players does not matter. Everybody starts with one hand touching a wall. The ball is then dropped in the center. Players slap the ball and try to hit the other players below the knee to get them out. The last player left in the pit wins.\n\nThere are more rules. Players cannot hold or throw the ball, and if someone hits the ball out of the pit, it has to touch another player first. Otherwise, they are out. If someone who is already out catches that ball, he or she is back in.\n\n\"It's kinda like dodgeball. I like gaga ball a lot better,\" says Madison fifth-grader Rian Klabunde. \"I just feel like it's not that competitive, and it's really just a fun way to hang out.\"\n\nThe rules, soft ball and small space make the sport safe and easy to play.\n\n## Game Scores With Kids, Adults\n\nCortesi, the physical education teacher, saw students playing gaga ball at another school. He noticed how much they liked it, and raised money to get Madison a gaga pit too. Parents and students helped him build the first pit.\n\nThe pit was so popular that Cortesi built another one. \"It's pretty cool when you see middle schoolers and high schoolers coming over to play together after school,\" he says.\n\nIllinois dad Cliff Silverman played gaga at a father-daughter camp in 2010. He saw how much the girls and dads liked it. He began making gear for the sport and now has a business selling it on the Internet.\n\nWhen he first started selling his gaga gear, very few people knew what the game was. \"I had to get people in the pit and teach them,\" Silverman says.\n\nPlayers may come home with scrapes, but there are no big dangers from gaga. Illinois father Dan Israelite says scrapes have given his sons rough hands. \"They can play for hours and hours. It's amazing how popular it is and how it stays this way.\"'"

            "text": "\tGirls, be careful with your knees.\n\nA new study shows that more and more kids are seriously injuring a part of their knee. The part that's getting hurt is known as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).\n\nThe ACL is not a bone, but a ligament - something a bit like a rubber band. It helps hold the bones of your leg together. If the ACL is stretched too far or torn, serious problems result.\n\nIt turns out that girls are more likely than boys to suffer this injury.\n\nThe new study compared girls and boys playing the same sport. It found that girls are two to six times more likely to hurt their ACL than boys.\n\nSeven out of 10 injuries happen without kids even touching another player.\n\n## Knees Are Sensitive\n\nUsually, you feel a pop in the knee and then see swelling, says Doctor Randall Schultz. Sometimes it will hurt; other times, the pain might not be that bad.\n\nIt's not something you have to go to the emergency room for, he says. However, you should see a doctor soon afterward to see what's going on and what needs to be done. In the meantime, put ice on it and use crutches to try to stay off it, Schultz says.\n\nSports where players stop suddenly and turn in a different direction usually are the cause. Such sports include soccer, gymnastics, volleyball and basketball. Boys also saw problems with football which is a contact sport. Doctors see injuries arising from all of these sports, along with cheerleading and dance.\n\nThe risk goes up for girls once they hit age 12 or 13 and for boys around age 14 or 15. Why? Puberty. The teen years are a time when kids grow faster. Sometimes, their bodies can't keep up. This is especially true of the leg's tibia and femur bones.\n\nWith girls, the ligaments become looser during the teen years. Teen boys generally see an increase in the size and strength of their muscles. This makes them more able to handle the quick growth of their bones.\n\n## Bouncing Back May Take Awhile\n\nThe number of kids with ACL injuries is on the rise because of a change in how they play sports: More kids these days are focusing on one sport intensely all year, with few breaks. In the past, kids played several different sports. They also took time off in between seasons.\n\nThe treatment now is also different. It used to be that you would simply keep the knee from moving. Now, if an ACL tears, doctors put in a new ligament. Afterward, the athlete must wait six months before returning to sports.\n\nAn ACL injury can have long-lasting effects. Athletes who've had one are very likely to develop arthritis in the knee. Arthritis would make the knee swollen and painful to use. Athletes with an ACL injury are 10 times more likely to develop arthritis than athletes who never had an ACL injury.\n\n\"I have daughters that play sports - I'm worried about it,\" Schultz says.\n\nAn earlier study looked at athletes older than 18 with an ACL injury. It found that around half were never again able to play as well as they had before their injury.\n\nOnce you have an ACL injury, you also are more likely to have another.\n\n## Be Sure And Warm Up The Muscles\n\nSo, what does all this mean for parents, and for their daughters (and sons)?\n\nOne good idea is to look for a coach who does warm-ups with knee-saving exercises.\n\nBethany Thoresen is an expert when it comes to helpful exercises. She says the best way to prevent an ACL injury is to strengthen the knees. It's also important to strengthen the hips and leg muscles.\n\nParents also should get realistic about how much sports their children are doing. They should have days off and should be playing different sports. If a child is doing the same sport all year, she is overusing some muscles and not strengthening others.\n\n\"It's too much,\" Thoresen says. \"They are not ready for it.\"'"

            "text": "\tAmaiya Zafar is a young girl in Minnesota who found a sport she loves and wants to practice. Through the sport, she hopes to learn more about herself and test just how good she can become.\n\nThere are barriers standing in Amaiya's way. For one, the sport she fell in love with is amateur boxing. More importantly, she is a 15-year-old Muslim girl who is as religious as she is dedicated. She wants to wear a hijab under her boxing helmet and uniform. A hijab is a head covering for Muslim women. Boxing rules do not allow Amaiya to wear a hijab in matches. Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should change with the times.\n\nAmaiya said the rules are old fashioned. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with getting them changed.\"\n\n## Boxing Love At First Sight\n\nAmaiya fell hard for boxing two years ago when she saw the boxing ring at a gym. Her father, Mohammad Zafar, suggested that she take up fencing, a type of sword fighting, but that was not for Amaiya. \"I'll box before I'll fence,\" she told him. That was that. He helped her to understand the sport by showing her videos and teaching her about amateur boxing. Finally, she stepped into a gym and then into the ring.\n\n\"Everyone was like, 'That's Amaiya. She's the small one,'\" she said.\n\nAmaiya's parents, meanwhile, became more and more supportive. \"When she first trained, I came into this as a mom and a nurse,\" her mother, Sarah O'Keefe-Zafar, said. A dedicated Amaiya trained for a year before she even fought a practice match. Over that time, O'Keefe-Zafar said she \"watched her go from a timid little girl to a confident young person.\"\n\nThe teen faced opposition from some boys who did not think a girl could box, but eventually they accepted her. \"Now they're my team,\" she said.\n\n## The Hijab Is Always Present\n\nRules about a hijab are not her only problem. She now stands 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 106 pounds. She is always, she says, \"the small one\" at the gym. There are not a lot of women who box to begin with, let alone those who are about the same height and weight. Boxers fight opponents who are about the same size. Opponents must also be within two years of one another. Then there is always the hijab. Removing it is not an option for a girl who cares deeply about her religion.\n\nInternational boxing rules say that she cannot cover her arms or her legs below the knees. Amaiya would like to wear a long-sleeved shirt and leggings beneath her tank top and shorts. USA Boxing has asked for a decision on the matter from AIBA, the international boxing organization.\n\n\"We have 30,000 amateur boxers in the United States,\" said Michael Martino, who is in charge of USA Boxing. \"So if you make allowances for one religious group, what if another comes in and says we have a different type of uniform we have to wear? You have to draw a line someplace.\"\n\nJaylani Hussein is in charge of Minnesota's Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that USA Boxing made the right move in asking AIBA to decide. \"You know, I think we are looking for an opportunity for this young girl to get a chance to do what all young teenagers\" do, Hussein said. \"The only difference is that she's a Muslim.\"\n\n## It's All Good In The Gym\n\nAmaiya is not the first athlete to fight to wear a hijab during sports. In 2014, FIFA, the world soccer organization, allowed players to wear religious head coverings during games.\n\nAmaiya takes her training seriously. \"If I'm in a bad mood, emotional or having a bad day,\" she said, her mother will tell her to go to the gym.\n\nIn the meantime, Amaiya is teaching a boxing class at the gym on Saturday mornings. She has eight students who wear a hijab in the class.'"

They sued the National Football League. Hockey players have also filed lawsuits in Washington and New York.\n\nBill Daly is the NHL's deputy commissioner. He said the league expected another lawsuit. \"Nothing changes our belief that all of these cases are without merit and they will be defended accordingly,\" he said.\n\nThe NHLPA, the union that represents the hockey players, declined to comment.\n\nZimmerman also worked on the legal case against the NFL. That league settled its case. It agreed to pay $765 million to thousands of retired players. That settlement is still awaiting a judge's approval. Still, the headlines it generated have been partially responsible for hockey players making their own case against the NHL.\n\n\"We've seen it in football. It's now here in hockey,\" Zimmerman said. The leagues knew about the injuries but did not protect the players, he said. He added that rules still have not been changed to prevent fighting in hockey.\n\n## Fights Breaking Out\n\nThe lawsuit claims \"the NHL hid or minimized concussion risks from its players.\" A [concussion](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) is a brain injury. It is caused by a blow to the head. The lawsuit said that because of the NHL's actions, players were at a much higher risk for developing symptoms. These include memory loss, trouble thinking, and even brain-related diseases.\n\nSome argue that the NFL case is different than the NHL case. They say that by fighting, players willfully take on the health risks.\n\n\"You could make that argument only to a point,\" Zimmerman said. But the fighting would not exist if the NHL had not allowed the fighting as a way to sell tickets, he said.  Zimmerman said that the players don't make the rules. The league does. \"If they would outlaw fighting, there wouldn't be people who would fight.\"\n\nZimmerman said he thinks more players will join the legal fight like they did in the NFL case.\n\n\"The light went on for them as the football players' story was becoming more told,\" Zimmerman said. \"I think the hockey players started to see that their story was going to be heard and told. It's not that we haven't known about football players or hockey players getting hurt. It's now become more important that we talk about it and do something about it,\" he said.'"
