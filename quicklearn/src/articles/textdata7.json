            "text": "\tLUXOR, Egypt - King Tut may be buried in an ancient Egyptian queen's tomb.\n\nMamdouh el-Damaty, Egypt's antiquities minister, said Tuesday that the 3,300-year-old tomb may contain hidden chambers.\n\nEl-Damaty said he will seek approval to use radar to inspect the tomb, by bouncing radio waves off of any objects. He made the announcement while touring the burial sites of Tutankhamun, known as King Tut, and other pharaohs in the famed Valley of the Kings.\n\n## Was Tut Tucked Into Nefertiti's Tomb?\n\nEl-Damaty was visiting Luxor with Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves, a British expert on ancient Egypt. Reeves recently speculated that Tutankhamun may have been buried in an outer chamber of what was originally the tomb of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. King Tut died at the age of 19.\n\nReeves said high-resolution images of the tomb \"revealed several very interesting features which look not at all natural.\" They include \"very, very straight lines which are 90 degrees to the ground.\" He said the lines seem to correspond with other features within the tomb.\n\nThe features are difficult to see with the naked eye, he said.\n\n## Design Indicates That Queen Is Buried There\n\nReeves said the walls could conceal two hidden doorways. One of them perhaps leads to Nefertiti's burial place. He also argued that the design of the tomb suggests it was built for a queen, rather than a king.\n\n\"I agree with him that there's probably something behind the walls,\" el-Damaty said. But he said if anyone is buried there it is likely Kia, believed by some Egyptologists to be King Tut's mother.\n\nNefertiti was famed for her beauty and was the model for a famous 3,300-year-old sculpture. She was the main wife of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, who introduced an early form of monotheism, or belief in one god, into Egypt. Akhenaten was followed by a pharaoh called Smenkhare and then Tut, who is widely believed to have been Akhenaten's son.\n\nReeves argues that Smenkhare is actually Nefertiti.\n\n## Ancient Egypt Awash In Mystery\n\nAround the same time that Smenkhare became pharoah, Nefertiti seemed to just disappear from history \"according to the latest inscriptions just being found,\" said Reeves. He explained his theory inside King Tut's tomb. \"I think that Nefertiti didn't disappear, she simply changed her name.\"\n\nAfter Nefertiti died, Tut was responsible for burying her. Then when he died, someone decided to build more chambers in the tomb, Reeves suggested. \"I think since Nefertiti had been buried a decade before, they remembered that tomb was there and they thought, 'Well, perhaps we can extend it,'\" he said.\n\nAny discovery would provide more information about this turbulent time in ancient Egypt.\n\n\"Akhenaten's family is full of secrets and historical issues that have yet to be resolved,\" el-Damaty said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Harry Potter, Elvis Presley and Bugs Bunny share one thing in common: They are not at all popular with traditional stamp collectors.\n\nSome philatelists - as stamp collectors are known - say the committee that picks new stamps is favoring pop stars and fictional characters. Such choices mean that cultural sites and historical figures appear less often. The result, they say, is that a long tradition is made less valuable.\n\n\"Harry Potter is a perfect example,\" said Ken Martin, director of the American Philatelic Society, a stamp-collecting group. He does not approve of a stamp of the fictional boy wizard or his British creator, J.K. Rowling.\n\n\"Why do you honor a British author's book?\" Martin asked. \"Wouldn't it be much more appropriate to honor something that reflects our country's (history), not the product of another country?\"\n\n## It's About Selling Stamps\n\nThe reason for the change, many say, is money - something the Postal Service badly needs. It has been losing huge amounts of money in recent years.\n\nThe newer stamps, celebrating things like \"Spider-Man\" or \"Star Wars,\" vastly outsell traditional stamps. These days, commemorations of the Civil War or pictures of Pacific Coast lighthouses just are not that popular. Not surprisingly, the Postal Service is favoring stamps it believes more people will buy.\n\nThe Postal Service certainly came up with a hit last November - the Harry Potter stamps.\n\nThe stamps display scenes from some of the eight wildly popular Harry Potter films. One stamp shows Harry reading the letter admitting him to Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. Another pictures him firing his wand in battle. Magical creatures like Dobby the house elf and Hedwig the owl are also featured.\n\nThe Postal Service issued its latest limited-edition commemorative stamp Friday. It honors legendary blues rocker Janis Joplin, who died at age 27.\n\n## \"Change And Improve\"\n\nPostal officials make no apologies for embracing pop culture. They especially hope to lure young people into collecting stamps.\n\n\"We need to change and improve to serve the changing needs of the American public,\" said Toni DeLancey, a Postal Service spokeswoman. \"Those current Americans that we want interested in stamps, these are probably the images they want to see.\"\n\nDeLancey defended the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, the 12-member group that evaluates future stamp issues. The group, she said, is just keeping up with the times.\n\nNot everyone agrees, however. Last month, Benjamin Bailar, who served as postmaster general from 1975 to 1978, angrily resigned from the committee. He accused the postal service of caring more about money than the quality of the stamps program.\n\nBailar suggested the committee be abolished if it is going to recommend things like cartoons.\n\n\"The stamp program should celebrate the things that are great about the United States,\" Bailar wrote. It should, he said, \"serve as a medium to communicate those things to a worldwide audience.\"\n\nBailar said the stamp program \"deserves more than comic-strip characters and pop- music characters.\"\n\n## Many Stamp Opinions\n\nThe committee chair, Janet Klug, said she was disappointed by Bailar's resignation and does not think he represents others in the group. The committee's goal, she said, is to increase public interest in stamp collecting.\n\n\"I don't even know if the post office is making more money,\" she said. \"I'm sure they would like to make more money - who wouldn't? But it's also trying to engage a broader public and get them interested in stamps.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES, Calif. - Where's Rey? Many people are wondering why \"Star Wars\" toys do not feature Rey. Disney says it is working to get more of the new \"Star Wars\" heroine into stores quickly.\n\nA firestorm erupted on the Internet over the lack of Rey in a new \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" Monopoly game. In response, Disney says it is releasing new merchandise that puts more of Rey front and center - including toys featuring her gripping a blue lightsaber.\n\nOver the holidays, Twitter exploded with the hashtag \"#wheresrey.\" Twitter users were shocked at the lack of Rey merchandise in stores, despite her playing a key role in the film. Early in January, an 8-year-old girl wrote Monopoly maker Hasbro, saying \"girls matter.\" Last week, both Disney and Hasbro decided to add a Rey piece to future editions later this year.\n\n## Flying Off The Shelves \n\nPaul Southern works on products that Disney designs with toymakers. He said part of the problem was high demand for hundreds of products featuring Rey. It meant that some shoppers could not find her on store shelves. Target spokesman Lee Henderson said Rey toys and apparel are selling \"exceptionally well\" and most stores are selling as fast as they can stock shelves.\n\nDisney had planned for more than a year to hold back certain toys. The company wanted to avoid giving away a key plot point where Rey picks up the lightsaber wielded by Finn in order to duel new baddie Kylo Ren.\n\nSome merchandisers always hold back products for big movies. For example, the Hot Wheels-made speeder ship that shows Rey as she was seen in movie trailers was held back to keep up excitement about the brand.\n\n\"The fact that she was the ultimate heroine of the film was one of the significant plot points we did want to protect,\" Southern said.\n\nThat meant keeping Rey out of Monopoly, which featured characters from older \"Star Wars\" movies but only two characters from the new film - Kylo Ren and Finn. If Rey had been a piece instead of Finn, \"we would be revealing she was the main protagonist,\" Southern said. The Monopoly game came out on Sept. 4, which Disney had dubbed \"Force Friday.\"\n\n## Coming Out In Batches \n\nJim Silver runs the toy review website TTPM.com. He says another factor behind the perceived lack of Rey toys and clothes was unexpected demand. Throughout \"Star Wars\" merchandise history, evil lord Darth Vader has outsold any other character by at least 3 to 1.\n\n\"We assumed Kylo Ren was going to be the next great villain,\" he said.\n\nSilver also said Disney was following through on a plan to release several batches of products. The first would have come out on Force Friday. The second set of toys would have revealed spoilers, and come out on the movie's release date of Dec. 18. This batch included a lightsaber-wielding Rey that was exclusive to the Disney Store. Disney also planned to release another batch in January.\n\nSteve Sansweet is the president of the \"Star Wars\" memorabilia museum Rancho Obi-Wan near Petaluma, California. He says Disney and the retailers are still adapting to the fact that \"Star Wars\" is not primarily a boy's brand like before.\n\n\"I think Hollywood and merchandisers are waking up to the fact that it's not just women and girls who want to buy Rey figures, it's guys too,\" he said.\n\nSansweet added that the conundrum creates an interesting collector's item: the Monopoly game with Rey and the one without. \"I want to get both versions,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tMILWAUKEE - A 300-year-old Stradivarius violin on loan to Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra lead violinist Frank Almond was stolen during an armed robbery last Monday.\n\nAlmond was attacked with a stun gun after he gave a performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College. The robbery of the instrument took place shortly before 10:30 p.m. in a parking lot in the rear of the school, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Tuesday at a news conference. Flynn said the violin was valued in the \"high seven figures.\"\n\nAs Almond lay on the cement, the robber fled to a nearby vehicle, which then left the scene, Flynn said. The escape vehicle, a maroon or burgundy minivan, was driven by another person.\n\nInvestigators believe the instrument was the target of the robbery, Flynn said. The violin is known in musical circles as the Lipinski Stradivarius.\n\n## A 300-Year History\n\nStradivarius violins are among the world's most famous and expensive. Built by Antonio Stradivari during the late 1600s and early 1700s, they have been played by some of the world's greatest violinists.\n\nIn a 2008 newspaper story on the violin, Chicago violin dealer Stefan Hersh said the Lipinski violin was similar in value to another Stradivarius that sold for more than $3.5 million in a 2006 auction.\n\nChief Flynn described the violin taken in the robbery as \"priceless.\" He said its value could only be appreciated by a very small population.\n\n\"It can't be easily sold for even a fraction of its value,\" he said. \"These are wildly valuable to a tiny slice of the art world.\"\n\nThe violin was crafted in 1715 in Cremona, Italy. It has a unique pattern on its back, the chief said.\n\nPolice have not ruled out that the robbery was an unplanned street crime. Yet, they are working with investigators with the FBI's art crimes team based in Virginia, which specializes in high-end art thefts. The International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has also been notified, Flynn said.\n\n\"This is a potentially international crime,\" Flynn said. Investigators are searching everywhere from pawn shops to international databases.\n\n## Once Played By Lipinski\n\nMilwaukee Symphony Orchestra president Mark Niehaus said Almond was recovering from the attack. He would not be on stage this weekend.\n\nThe instrument was on long-term loan to Almond from its owners, who are unknown. Almond has described them as people with \"strong ties to Milwaukee.\" It's a common practice in the music world for the owners of famous instruments to loan them to expert, talented musicians such as Almond.\n\nThe violin's early owners included the virtuoso Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770). He's known to listeners for his \"Devil's Trill Sonata.\" The instrument has also belonged to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski (1790-1861), whose name has stayed attached to it.\n\nLocal music writer Elaine Schmidt held the instrument during a 2013 interview with Almond. She described it as \"light, far lighter than one would expect, and an absolutely gorgeous example of craftsmanship.\"\n\nDuring that 2013 interview, Almond explained that the Lipinski is \"finicky\" about temperature and humidity. The violin responds differently some days than others.\n\n## Vibrations Keep The Violin \"Alive\"\n\n\"One of the really mysterious things about these instruments is that they really maximize our strengths if we can figure out how to play them,\" he said. He began playing the Lipinski in 2008. He found the instrument produces sound differently than one would think. Its sound tightens and narrows as the player adds more bow pressure on the strings.\n\n\"It's like a high-performance car,\" he said. \"You have to learn to drive it.\"\n\nAlmond said in a previous interview that he was told the violin had been stored in a bank vault. The bank is just a short distance from where Almond was playing with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He met the violin owners at the bank, and they asked him if he wanted to play it on loan. He said yes.\n\nNiehaus said that because the violin is made of wood, \"it needs to be touched, it needs to be played.\"\n\nHe added, \"The vibrations of the music keep it alive.\"\n\nAlmond conducted a Kickstarter campaign to fund \"A Violin's Life,\" a recording that memorialized the history of the violin. If featured music by the violin's owners throughout history.\n\nIn 2013, British police recovered a stolen 300-year-old Stradivarius violin that had been missing for more than two years.'"

            "text": "\tAMSTERDAM (AP) - A painting that sat for 60 years in a Norwegian industrialist's attic after he was told it was a fake Van Gogh was pronounced the real thing this month. It is the first full-size canvas by the tortured Dutch artist to be discovered since 1928.\n\nThe 1888 landscape \"Sunset at Montmajour\" was painted by Vincent Can Gogh. Experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam confirmed it by looking at Van Gogh's letters, the chemical makeup of the paints and X-rays of the painting.\n\nAt an unveiling ceremony, museum director Axel Rueger called the discovery a \"once-in-a-lifetime experience.\"\n\n\"This is a great painting from what many see as the high point of his artistic achievement, his period in Arles, in southern France,\" Rueger said. \"In the same period, he painted works such as 'Sunflowers,' 'The Yellow House' and 'The Bedroom.'\"\n\n## Van Gogh Paintings Fetch Millions ...\n\nMuseum officials would not identify the owner who brought the artwork to the museum in 2011 to be authenticated. Van Gogh paintings are among the most valuable in the world, fetching tens of millions of dollars on the rare occasions one is sold at auction.\n\nThe artwork will be on display at the museum beginning Sept. 24.\n\nThe roughly 37-by-29-inch \"Sunset at Montmajour\" shows a dry landscape of twisting oak trees, bushes and sky. It was done during the period when Van Gogh was increasingly adopting the thick \"impasto\" brush strokes. They became typical of his work in the final years of his short life.\n\nIt can be dated to the exact day it was painted. Van Gogh described it in a letter to his brother, Theo. He  said he had painted it the previous day - July 4, 1888.\n\n\"At sunset I was on a stony heath where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill and wheat fields in the valley,\" Van Gogh wrote. \"It was romantic. ... The sun was pouring its very yellow rays over the bushes and the ground, absolutely a shower of gold.\"\n\nBut then Van Gogh confessed that the painting was \"well below what I'd wished to do.\" Later he sent it to Theo to keep.\n\n## ... But Not During His Lifetime\n\nVan Gogh struggled with periods of mental distress throughout his life and died after shooting himself in the head in 1890. He sold only one painting during his lifetime.\n\nThree researchers put together what happened and wrote about it in The Burlington Magazine. They said the painting was recorded as number 180 in Theo's collection and given the title \"Sun Setting at Arles.\" It was sold to French art dealer Maurice Fabre in 1901.\n\nFabre never recorded selling the work. The painting disappeared from history until it reappeared in 1970 in the estate of Norwegian industrialist Christian Nicolai Mustad.\n\nMustad's family said he purchased it in 1908 as a young man in one of his first attempts at collecting art. He was soon told by the French ambassador to Sweden that it was a fake. Embarrassed, Mustad banished it to the attic.\n\nAfter Mustad's death in 1970, the distinguished art dealer Daniel Wildenstein took another look at it. He said he thought the painting was a fake Van Gogh or possibly the work of a lesser-known German painter. It was sold to a collector. The museum would not say who bought it or whether it had been resold since then.\n\n## Van Gogh Described Painting In Letter\n\nThe museum declined to authenticate the painting in 1991, when the unknown owner brought it to them.\n\n\"That may be a painful admission, given that the same museum is now attributing it to Van Gogh, but it is understandable,\" The Burlington Magazine article said. The experts had no information about what was shown in the painting.\n\nTeio Meedendorp is one of three experts who worked on the project. He said previous experts might also have been confused because the painting was done at a \"transitional\" moment in Van Gogh's style.\n\nAmong other reasons experts had their doubts: The painting was unsigned. Parts of the foreground were not \"as well-observed as usual,\" the researchers said. And part of the right side of the painting used a different style of brush strokes.\n\nBut when the museum took a fresh look at the work in 2011, its experts had the advantage of a new collection of all Van Gogh's letters. They were able to identify for the first time the exact location \"Sunset\" shows: Montmajour hill, near Arles. The ruins of Montmajour Abbey can be seen in the background.\n\n## Whereabouts Of Some Other Paintings Unknown\n\nVan Gogh mentioned the painting in two other letters that same summer.\n\nMeedendorp said \"Sunset\" belongs \"to a special group of experimental works\" by Van Gogh. At times, the painter thought less of them than experts do today, Meedendorp said.\n\nHe said it's not impossible another unknown or lost Van Gogh could be found someday. The artist is believed to have completed more than 800 works. While he destroyed some when he wasn't satisfied with the results, the whereabouts of others that are mentioned in his letters or early catalogs of his work are unknown.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum houses 140 Van Gogh paintings and receives more than a million visitors a year.'"

            "title": "World War I: A bloody birth to modernism in art",
            "text": "\tNEW YORK - In the summer of 1914, American author Henry James knew that something had been lost forever.\n\nWorld War I was just two weeks old at the time. James was living in London. He wrote to a friend that he was \"sick beyond cure\" to have lived to see the war. He described it as \"black and hideous\".\n\n\"You and I ... should have been spared this wreck of our belief that through the long years we had seen civilization grow and the worst become impossible,\" he wrote. \"It seems to me to undo everything, everything that was ours, in the most horrible retroactive way.\"\n\nJames died in 1916, two years before the war ended. The wreckage of World War I was worse than even James could have imagined. Millions were dead, empires were dissolved and centuries-old beliefs were turned upside down.\n\n## A Terribly Destructive War\n\nLong conflicts destroy the worlds they began in. Few did so as thoroughly and as terribly as World War I, which began 100 years ago this month.\n\nAmong writers, World War I changed both the stories they told and how they told them. Artists in general produced great paintings, music and film. The war also led to many of the central achievements of an artistic movement, called modernism, that raised questions still being asked today.\n\n\"If you look at the 19th century, you have this whole notion of progress through technology,\" says Jan Schall, an art historian at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\"What the war did was turn this ideal upside down. You had mass death through mass technological warfare,\" he said.\n\nWorld War I was unique for the art it inspired. It was also unique for the art's disappointment with war itself. Winners and losers both despaired.\n\n## Killing The Dream\n\nAdam Kirsch, an essayist, says poetry had a history dating back to ancient Greece of treating war as a tragic, but essential proving ground. World War I broke the spell.\n\nKirsch wrote that wars today are justified on the grounds of self-defense or human rights, \"never on the grounds that war itself is a splendid achievement or the true calling of men.\"\n\nPoets and writers on both sides of the Atlantic at first cheered on the battle. Carl Sandburg's \"Four Brothers\" hailed the \"Ballplayers, lumberjacks, ironworkers, ready in khaki / A million, ten million, singing, 'I am ready.'\" The war destroyed the dream.\n\nAmerican painter John Singer Sargent spent time at the front. His 20-foot-long painting \"Gassed\" shows blinded soldiers forming a procession. A gas attack had burned their eyes.\n\nT.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men\" sketches a ravaged, barren landscape:\n\n_In this valley of dying stars_\n\n_In this hollow valley_\n\n_This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms_\n\n_In this last of meeting places_\n\n_We grope together_\n\n_And avoid speech_\n\n_Gathered on this beach of the tumid river_\n\nSoldiers returned injured, traumatized and bewildered. Writer Gertrude Stein called these soldiers a \"lost generation.\" Erich Maria Remarque wrote a famous anti-war novel called \"All Quiet On the Western Front\" about a German soldier who rejects patriotism and loses his humanity. He is killed on a day when all was quiet in the trenches.\n\n## No One Wants To Hear\n\nErnest Hemingway's short story \"Soldier's Home\" tells of a veteran named Krebs who finds that no one in his community wants to hear what really happened over there.\n\n\"Krebs found that to be listened to at all he had to lie and after he had done this twice he, too, had a reaction against the war and against talking about it,\" Hemingway wrote. \"A distaste for everything that had happened to him in the war set in because of the lies he had told.\"\n\nThe war was a severing of history. It justified the skepticism of modernists who questioned whether a book needed a beginning, middle and end or whether a song needed a melody.\n\n\"War proved that everything was temporary, fleeting, and the art world reflected it,\" says Doran Cart, senior curator of the National World War I Museum in Kansas City. \"And it helped inspire works of modernism because the war itself was so modern and changed how people saw their communities and saw each other.\"\n\nIronically, one of the war's most enduring images was a call to service, not a protest. In 1917, artist James Montgomery Flagg was asked by the U.S. government to create a poster that would encourage young people to join the military. He sketched a furrowed, red-cheeked man with a starred top hat and white goatee, the face based in part on Flagg himself.\n\nHe added a simple tagline: \"I Want YOU For U.S. Army,\" shortened in popular memory to \"UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU.\"'"

            "text": "\tEL RETIRO, Colombia - Americans love avocados. We import them from far and wide, from Mexico to as far south as Chile. We also grow our own in California. Now, Colombia is hoping to become the newest region to sell avocados to the United States.\n\nTo start exporting avocados to the United States, Colombian growers need to get over a few hurdles. First, they need to show that their avocados are properly grown and safe to eat. They will also have to get legal permission to sell avocados in the United States, which can be a complicated process. Despite these challenges, most people think Colombia will start exporting avocados to the United States within the next 24 months or so.\n\n## Lucky Number 81\n\nColombia already has a business relationship with the United States. According to Colombian Minister of Agriculture Aurelio Iragorri, his country exports 80 agricultural products to the United States. Avocados could be number 81.\n\nU.S. demand for avocados has jumped 174 percent in the past 14 years. In other words, it has nearly doubled. With the increase in demand, there has also been an increase in competition among avocado sellers.\n\nMexico supplied 1.3 billion pounds of avocados to the United States in 2014, followed by California with 282 million pounds. Peru sold 144 million pounds and Chile sold 89 million pounds.\n\nSome Colombians think they can compete, especially with Peru and Chile. Colombia is closer to the United States than Peru and Chile are, so it might be able to sell avocados there more easily.\n\n## Avocado Welcome Mat Is Out\n\nAndres Eduardo Mej\\xc3\\xada is the executive director of CORPOHASS, the association of Colombia's avocado producers and exporters. He believes that, despite the competition, the Colombian avocado market will be successful. Avocados are extremely popular in the United States, and that popularity seems only to be growing.\n\nThe U.S. government has been welcoming toward Colombian avocado sellers. Even so, the process to start selling a product in the United States is slow. The government has tried to speed things up by providing training and expertise to help Colombian companies.\n\nThis week, U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Kevin Whitaker visited an avocado processing plant in Colombia. As ambassador, part of his role is to maintain good relationships with the Colombian people and government. The avocado plant he visited was just outside Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city.\n\nAgricultural Counselor Michael Conlon works with Whitaker. He commented that the visit showed that the United States and Colombia had a strong partnership. The economic partnership of the two countries would be strengthened by avocado trade.\n\n## \"Avocados Have A Great Future\"\n\nColombian companies have already begun expanding their avocado production while they wait for permission to sell in the United States. Colombian land dedicated to avocado production more than doubled from 2008 to 2014. The country is on track to produce 42,500 tons this year, Iragorri said.\n\n\"But 42,000 tons isn't enough,\" he said, looking forward to a U.S. opening. \"Avocados have a great future.\"\n\nWhile Colombia tries to enter an already crowded market, there is one avocado-growing region that does not have to worry about competition. Florida is the second-largest avocado-producing state, behind California. It is expected to harvest somewhere between 1 million and 1.2 million bushels this year, or about 66 million pounds, according to the state's Avocado Committee.\n\n## Variety Is Good\n\nUnlike California and Colombia, however, Florida specializes in green avocados, a different variety from the dark-skinned Haas avocados that most Americans are used to.\n\nBrooks Tropicals is South Florida's largest grower of avocados. It has started calling Florida's green avocados \"SlimCados\" to highlight the fact that they have less fat than Haas avocados.\n\nMary Ostlund, director of marketing at Brooks Tropicals, pointed out that consumers may enjoy having more than one kind of avocado from which to choose. \"People are realizing they like to eat more than one kind of avocado,\" she said. She added that most grocery stores stock both varieties.\n\nShe sees the green avocado market and the Haas avocado market as separate. As far as green avocados are concerned, Florida has little competition.\n\n\"It's just kind of a separate market,\" Ostlund said. \"I guess we have staked out our own little corner.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES  - Comcast Corp. will buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for about $45.2 billion. The deal would combine the nation's top two cable TV companies.\n\nThe combined company would be very important in both creating TV shows and movies and delivering them to U.S. homes. Comcast is not just a cable and Internet company. It also owns television networks like NBC. Universal movie studio, which makes movies like \"Despicable Me,\" is also part of Comcast.\n\nThe deal was approved by the people in charge of both companies. It is expected to be final by the end of the year as long as the people who own stock in the companies and the government also approve the deal.\n\n## Charter Vs. Comcast\n\nTime Warner and Comcast are both public companies, meaning they are owned by many people who are called shareholders. Anyone can buy part of Time Warner or Comcast on the stock market. The people who own parts - or shares - of Time Warner would get about $158.82 per share.\n\nThe price beats an offer by another cable company. Charter Communications Inc. offered to buy Time Warner Cable for about $132.50 per share. The Charter offer is worth about $38 billion.\n\nTime Warner shareholders will end up owning about 23 percent of the combined company.\n\nCharter had pursued Time Warner Cable for months. Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus consistently rejected the offer, saying it was too low. He said he would cut a deal for $160 per share.\n\nFor a time, Comcast stayed in the background and waited to purchase any chunk of subscribers that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would sell off. Subscribers are the people who pay for cable television.\n\nCharter had planned to borrow money to pay for Time Warner. It would take on $25 billion in debt. As part of a plan to pay off the debt quickly, the company considered selling off some of the places where it had customers after a deal had closed. Time Warner Cable's Marcus was against the idea of being part of a company with huge debt.\n\n## Combining Customers\n\nComcast now plans to sell off 3 million pay TV subscribers after the deal closes. It has 22 million pay TV customers, compared with Time Warner Cable's 11.2 million. So the combined company will end up with about 30 million subscribers after those 3 million are sold.\n\nIt is believed that having 30 million subscribers is not enough to worry government authorities who look at mergers. Their job is to make sure that a company does not become so big that it can raise prices without worrying about competition. Selling off some territories of subscribers could help the deal get approved more quickly.\n\nComcast argues that Comcast and Time Warner Cable don't serve the same markets. Just because they become one company doesn't mean there will be less competition, Comcast says. Comcast operates mainly in the Northeast. It offers cable in its home base of Philadelphia and places such as Boston, Washington and Chicago. Time Warner Cable has strongholds around its headquarters in New York as well as Los Angeles, Dallas and Milwaukee.\n\nIn many of those areas, the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable will face competition from AT&amp;T and Verizon. Those two companies provide both pay TV services and Internet hookups. Both AT&amp;T and Verizon are growing quickly. They ended 2013 with 5.5 million and 5.3 million pay TV subscribers, respectively.\n\n## Worries About Comcast's Power\n\nComcast and Time Warner Cable are expected to save $1.5 billion in annual costs over three years.\n\nCharter conceded that it lost the takeover battle. It issued a statement Wednesday saying, \"Charter has always maintained that our greatest opportunity to create value for shareholders is by executing our current business plan.\"\n\nSome groups opposed the Comcast-Time Warner deal. The Washington-based group Public Knowledge stands up for customers and protects people from being cheated by businesses. It said Wednesday that the government must stop the deal, because it would give Comcast power that no other company has had before \"in several important markets.\"\n\nIt said, \"An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard.\"'"

            "text": "\tThe U.S. government is making it easier for Cuban entrepreneurs to sell their products to American customers. The State Department recently announced that private entrepreneurs in Cuba would be allowed to export certain products to the United States.\n\nU.S. government officials published a list of products that could not be traded between the counties. That left many people wondering how much the new policy would actually affect the economies in Cuba and the United States.\n\nOne Miami attorney saw an opportunity in the confusing regulations, which are called the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Lenny Feldman decided to make a clear list of the products that could be exported from Cuba under the new rules. He calls this his \"yes\" list. It includes the specific goods that self-employed workers from Cuba are now permitted to sell to the United States.\n\n## Embargo Began In 1960 After Cuban Revolution\n\nThe U.S. government first placed a trade embargo against Cuba in 1960, after Fidel Castro's Communist government came to power in a revolution. The embargo made it illegal for Americans to trade with Cuba. The embargo has remained in place for decades. This year, President Barack Obama announced that the United States would normalize relations with Cuba. The two countries have begun to make peace after years as enemies. Making exceptions to the embargo is part of that process.\n\nFeldman's list catalogs which items are exceptions and can now be sold under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule.\n\nIt turns out that the list is pretty long. There are more products that can be imported than many people originally thought. This is good news for the more than 480,000 Cuban cuentapropistas - the Cuban word for entrepreneur.\n\nThe State Department hopes the new rules will make it easier for these private entrepreneurs to be able to develop products and sell them.\n\n## Live Animals And Animal Products Prohibited\n\nThe U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule prohibits the export from Cuba of all live animals and animal products. It does allow raw hides, skins, leather, furs, saddles and harnesses, handbags and travel goods to be sold.\n\nPaper products, plastics and rubber, ceramics, glass, pieces of stone, plaster and cement, footwear, hats, umbrellas, toys and games, artificial flowers and feathers are allowed as well.\n\nAlso permitted are soap, cosmetics, candles, waxes, polishes, perfume, and photography goods made by independent entrepreneurs. Jewelry-makers were given the green light too.\n\nCuentapropistas can also export some home goods, watches and musical instruments to the United States.\n\nWhile some more sophisticated products are allowed too, it is not clear how many independent entrepreneurs or private companies are actually making these in Cuba right now.\n\n## New Policies Intended To Support Cuban Entrepreneurs\n\nWhile the State Department is permitting many items, it has said no to many others, such as sugar, prepared food and beverages, and aircraft.\n\nMany of the items on the \"no\" list are produced by government-owned companies, according to Ted Piccone, an economics researcher.\n\nThe purpose of the new policies, he said, is to support Cuba's private workers and companies. Currently, the Cuban government controls almost the entire Cuban economy. That can make supporting private businesses a challenge.\n\nThe new policies take into account the fact that the government produces many products. It attempts to include only products the government does not manufacture. That may explain why some items are on \"yes\" list while others are not, even though the products are sometimes very similar. Feldman admitted it can get tricky.\n\nWhile wool and cotton are not allowed to be exported, many other fabrics are permitted. The policy allows knitted and woven clothes, lace, embroidery, carpets and other floor coverings, and textiles made from felt, twine, rope, vegetable fibers and man-made materials.\n\n## Trade Still Won't Be Easy\n\nThe State Department said the import list should help independent Cuban entrepreneurs do more business, improve their lives, and create positive change within their communities.\n\nEven though the policies create a more open and trade-friendly economy, it does not mean that exchanges with small private Cuban businesses and entrepreneurs will be easy.\n\nPiccone said that some of the laws within Cuba may need to be reformed. He said Cuban officials are not yet ready to regulate, control and tax the products that might be entering the country.\n\nThe State Department said it \"cannot predict what the Cuban government will or will not allow\" even with the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule in place. Officials hope Cuban officials adopt the ideas and continue to provide opportunities to private-sector workers.\n\nAnother challenge is that there is currently no direct mail service between Cuba and the U.S. That could make shipping goods between the countries difficult. Currently, products that are sent to Cuba from the United States go by ship.\n\n## Making Trade Happen With Suitcase Commerce\n\nAt first, the countries might need to exchange goods using a system called suitcase commerce. Suitcase commerce depends on travelers carrying permitted goods in their luggage and transporting materials that way.\n\nAnother factor that might make adopting the new rules complicated is Cuba's currency system. The country has a dual currency system, using both Cuban pesos and Cuban convertible pesos (CUC). Pesos are used for most salaries and everyday purchases and the value of one CUC is approximately 25 pesos. CUC are used by state companies and in the public sector; one CUC is worth one American dollar.\n\nThere are still many questions about how the new policies will impact the economy in Cuba. Piconne said nobody knows how the country will handle payments and the new products that might be traded.'"

            "title": "A hotter Earth needs farm animals that can adapt and feed billions of us",
            "text": "\tNEWARK, Del. - Two years ago, a team of researchers traveled to Africa to search for chickens. They weren't, however, looking for hens that laid delicious eggs.\n\nThey were seeking birds that could survive a hotter planet.\n\nAround the country, food scientists are racing to develop new breeds of farm animals that can stand up to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global warming).\n\nSome climate change activists dismiss their work, which is just getting under way. They consider it a distraction to the real problem. They also say it gives in to factory farms, which they blame for making the world's environmental problems worse. The scientists, though, say new breeds of farm animals that can resist heat will be essential to feeding the world.\n\n## Looking For A New Direction\n\nThe experiments reflect a shift in the federal government's response to climate change. Efforts to slow global warming aren't going as well as hoped. So the government is looking for ways to make sure that key industries, like food production, won't suffer from a warmer Earth.\n\nIn agriculture, \"we are dealing with the challenge of difficult weather conditions at the same time we have to massively increase food production,\"  said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Larger populations will mean a need for more meat.\n\nAt the University of Delaware, Carl Schmidt and other researchers are trying to map the genetic code of a bizarre-looking African naked-neck chicken. They hope the chicken's ability to withstand heat can be bred into U.S. fowl.\n\n\"The game is changing since the climate is changing,\" Schmidt said. \"We have to start now to anticipate what changes we have to make in order to feed 9 billion people.\"\n\n## Animals React To Heat\n\nWarmer temperatures can create huge problems for animals farmed for food. Turkeys are at risk for a condition that makes their meat mushy. Heat also helps disease to rip through chicken coops. Bad weather can kill entire cattle herds.\n\n\"It's a big problem when it happens,\" said Gale Strasburg. He is a professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University. His goal is to develop stronger turkeys. Right now, within a day or two after a heat wave hits, 40 percent of turkeys will be suffering from the heat.\n\n\"If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this,\" he said.\n\nStrasburg is turning up the heat lamps on hundreds of turkey chicks and eggs. He then tries to figure out which genes could help the animals endure hotter environments.\n\n\"The reality we deal with is that worldwide the demand is growing for meat,\" he said. There will be more pressure to produce farm animals that can be raised without using so many resources.\n\n## Many Questions Still Unanswered\n\nSome well-known climate experts, however, question the federal government's emphasis on the growing demand for meat. Raising animals uses many resources. So the only way to reduce greenhouse gases may be to encourage people to eat less meat, they say. Scientists are just about certain that global warming is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gasses. Greenhouses gasses are created by burning fossil fuels, like oil and coal, and cutting down trees.\n\n\"There's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people,\" Bill Gates wrote recently on his blog. Gates, the founder of Microsoft, supports technology that uses pea proteins to create beef and chicken that look like the real thing. In the year 2050, it's estimated there will be 9 billion people on Earth. Right now, there are about 7 billion.\n\nThe food scientists argue that they, too, are focused on using fewer resources.\n\nMegan Rolf is a scientist at Oklahoma State University. She is trying to develop cattle that need less water and feed.\n\nPicky eaters complicate her work.\n\nThe Brahman breed of cattle, for example, does well in hot, harsh conditions. But it doesn't taste good. Rolf's goal is to create a steer as hardy as a Brahman and as tasty as an Angus, a cattle breed known for delicious meat.\n\n## Let's Look At The Chicken Again\n\nBack in Delaware, Schmidt pulled up an image of the African bird. He pointed to the lack of feathers on its bare neck. Its naked neck helps keep it cool.\n\n\"What the industry really wants is that in a meat producer,\" he said.\n\nHe then pulled out a climate map of the United States. The map is marked with yellow dots where the temperature spikes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit more than 10 days a year.\n\nScientists say the Earth will warm an average of 2 degrees. But that's not what Schmidt is focused on. \"It's the increased number and duration of heat waves. The issue is helping these chickens or any animals survive in a state of increased heat.\"\n\nA few buildings away, students delicately drop chicken blood into test tubes to map the chickens' genes. Schmidt predicts that heat resistant chickens will start being produced in large numbers in about 15 years.\n\nBut Schmidt says his work can be most helpful in increasing the survival of chickens in poverty-stricken areas of Africa and South America.\n\nIf the developing world doesn't have enough food, he said, \"that affects everybody.\"'"

            "title": "PRO/CON:  Is it time to label GMO foods? ",
            "text": "\t### PRO: You won't have to worry about what's in your food\n\nHealth and food safety are scary subjects for millions of Americans - and rightly so.\n\nPolls indicate alarm over the contamination of everyday foods. Americans are worried about pesticides, antibiotics, hormones and other unnatural things added to food. Americans are especially concerned about genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nGMOs are plant or animal products that have been re-engineered in a lab. Scientists use the DNA of bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals. The purpose is to make seeds yield more crops or make the crops heartier. GMOs also make them more tolerant of herbicides that kill weeds, and resistant to insects and drought.\n\n## Many Americans Want GMO Labels\n\nA recent New York Times poll found that 93 percent of Americans want GMOs labeled. Already, 64 nations require such labels.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans believe that GMOs are unsafe. Millions of consumers are switching over to non-GMO, organic foods. As a result, organics have moved from a niche market into a $40 billion powerhouse.\n\nIndeed, Americans now spend more than 10 cents of every food dollar for items labeled \"organic,\" \"non-GMO\" or \"natural.\"\n\nPossible GMO labeling laws made it onto voting ballots in California, Washington and Oregon. The big food companies like Coca-Cola and chemical companies like Monsanto, the world's largest manufacturer of genetically modified seeds, spent vast sums of money to sway voters. They were successful in stopping these labeling laws from passing.\n\nVermont, Maine and Connecticut have passed popular laws requiring the labeling of GMOs. In addition, eight counties in California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii have banned GMO crops altogether.\n\nVermont's GMO labeling law goes into effect in July 2016, already causing panic among major food brands. They know they're in a predicament. One option they have is to remove all GMO ingredients from their products - which is what happened in the European Union after GMO food labeling became required in 1998. Otherwise, they can add a GMO label on the front of their packages and bottles.\n\n## Banned In Europe But Not In U.S.\n\nEighty percent of supermarket foods now contain GMOs and the toxic chemicals sprayed on GMOs.\n\nIn March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) declared Monsanto's Roundup glyphosate herbicide a \"probable carcinogen.\"\n\nThat prompted the banning of all GMO cultivation in several dozen nations, including much of Europe.\n\nIn the United States, the glyphosate herbicide currently is sprayed heavily on 84 percent of all GMO crops. Corn, soybeans, canola, sugar beets, cotton, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.\n\nIn California, authorities announced that Monsanto's glyphosate would be added to its list of cancer-causing chemicals.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) previously acknowledged that long-term exposure to glyphosate can cause kidney and reproductive damage. And a report by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year connected glyphosate to damage done to the human gut and digestive system.\n\nGlyphosate use has also resulted in uncontrollable, herbicide-resistant superweeds on the majority of U.S. farmland. Meanwhile, the EPA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given the green light to a controversial new generation of GMO crops. These crops are allowed to be sprayed with strong toxicides including 2,4-D - a component of Agent Orange. A herbicide, Agent Orange, was used to destroy crops and forests  during the Vietnam War.\n\n## A Bad Bill In Congress\n\nBillions of pounds of glyphosate, atrazine, 2,4-D and other toxic pesticides are now being sprayed on our food to prevent pests from ruining crops. In addition, billions of pounds of highly polluting chemical fertilizers are added to help crops grow.\n\nThis GMO chemical onslaught is destroying our health and contaminating our soil, water and air.\n\nAmericans want GMO labeling. Unfortunately, Monsanto, other big food companies and the members of Congress who receive political donations from them have decided that you, the consumer, have no right to know what's in your food.\n\nIn July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a highly unpopular bill, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015. It would take away states' and consumers' rights to require labels on GMO foods.\n\nThe bill also makes it legal to fraudulently label GMO and chemical tainted foods as \"natural.\" Now this bill, dubbed the DARK (Deny Americans the Right to Know) Act, goes to the Senate.\n\nAmericans can help stop passage of the DARK Act. Tell the House and Senate you want mandatory labels on GMOs.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: A leading global food activist, Ronnie Cummins is executive director of Organic Consumers Association, a nonprofit U.S.-based network of 850,000 consumers, and the author of \"Genetically Engineered Foods: A Self-Defense Guide for Consumers.\" Readers may write him at OCA, 6771 South Silver Hill Drive, Finland, MN 55603\\n> \\n> This essay is available to Tribune News Service subscribers. Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.\n\n### CON: No need to worry, GMOs are safe\n\nIt's been estimated that 70 to 80 percent of foods eaten in the United States contain ingredients that have been genetically modified. They are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nBut labeling these foods is certainly not a food safety issue. There has never been a case of harm to people from GMO products - ever. And it's also not something that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can legally do right now. It can't because there is no scientific difference between GMO foods and regular foods.\n\nBy the year 2025, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimates that two-thirds of the world's population will confront a water shortage. Ecosystems will also suffer.\n\nOne way to make this scenario less dangerous to our food supply is to use GMO foods. They reduce the need for plowing fields. This allows the soil to stay moist and helps plants retain water.\n\nIn some cases, this will make the difference between a harvest or crop failure. Some results show crop yields increasing by 4 to 8 percent in dry weather. Other results suggest gains as much as 21 percent.\n\nWith nearly 1 person in every 9 not having enough to eat on this planet, that's a promising start.\n\n## Pesticides No Cause For Fear\n\nAnother way that GMO foods help us is that they use less pesticide. One study found that it reduced the quantity of pesticides by 37 percent and the cost by 39 percent. Although pesticides get a bad rap, the truth is that the trace amounts of pesticides that you find in the average diet are totally safe.\n\nAs one toxicologist put it, there are more carcinogens in a single cup of coffee than there are in all of the pesticide residue you consume in a year. That doesn't mean that coffee will give you cancer. All it means is that human exposure to pesticides is extremely low.\n\nAn increase in yield and a decrease in pesticide costs will lower the price of food. That's a good thing, particularly if you're not well off.\n\nIt's amazing that, after 20 years of GMO crops, there is still a debate about them. In fact, the manipulation of food genes is nothing new. It's just a newer version of natural plant breeding that began between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. Back then, farmers bred plants by choosing the best ones to retain for planting in the following year.\n\nThe corn we eat today, for example, is the result of genetically modified plantings from thousands of years ago. Within the last few hundred years, farmers began artificially mating or cross-pollinating plants to increase yields. GMO foods are a scientific extension of this process. Modern technology just allows the process to be done to greater effect and to tackle specific problems.\n\n## Labels Would Discourage Innovation\n\nThanks to technology, we can produce crops that keep better and are easier to process. These crops produce foods that spoil less from mold, have fewer allergens and, ultimately, grow medicines in them.\n\nWe have already seen that with Golden Rice, a GMO food that contains beta carotene (Vitamin A) which helps to reduce blindness. It even prevents up to 2 million deaths annually in poor countries.\n\nLabeling GMO products would be expensive. It could also discourage innovation in this necessary technology.\n\nWhile labels may seem like a good way to share information, the costs on manufacturers will force them to raise food prices. Many people simply cannot afford that.\n\nFor those who wish to buy non-GMO foods, there is the option to buy organic. However, it's important to keep in mind that if you buy organic, you are actually putting yourself more at risk.\n\nOrganic foods are four to eight times more likely to be recalled for microbial contamination. And for that, you are paying a lot more.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Richard Williams is vice president for policy research and director of the Regulatory Studies Program at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.

            "title": "Has the U.S. become less safe because of the partial government shutdown?",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The government shutdown has already hampered efforts to protect Americans' health and safety, from investigating accidents to tracking illnesses transmitted by food.\n\nThe latest example is an outbreak of salmonella in chicken. The bacteria have made people in 18 states sick.\n\nFederal agencies have had to tell some employees to stay home during the shutdown because they have not been given the budget to pay their workers.\n\nBut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday that it was bringing back some of its staff to deal with the salmonella outbreak. More than 270 people have been made sick by the tainted chicken. Before Tuesday, the CDC had only a handful of scientists working on outbreak detection. Its ability to track deadly illnesses was severely hindered.\n\n## Salmonella Outbreak In 18 States\n\nThe states have had to pick up much of the slack from federal workers.\n\nIn the case of food safety, state labs are investigating foodborne illnesses and communicating with each other to figure out whether outbreaks have spread. In many case, they do not have any help from the federal government.\n\nDr. Christopher Braden heads the CDC division that investigates foodborne illness. He said the agency will be able to better monitor the salmonella outbreak with the recalled federal staff. But the agency is monitoring more than 30 outbreaks. Gaps still exist as the shutdown begins its second week.\n\nThe staff will go through a backlog of cases, he said. They could find something that was missed earlier.\n\n\"When that's the case, it's harder to start investigations later than earlier,\" Braden said.\n\nMicroorganisms like salmonella can cause disease. They are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope. The CDC stopped watching for some disease-causing microorganisms in food when staffers were sent home last week.\n\n## 3 Miners Dead In 3 Accidents In 3 Days\n\nThe CDC isn't the only agency protecting health and safety that's strained. The shutdown has forced the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration to halt its regular mine safety inspections. It normally conducts those at each of the nation's underground mines every three months.\n\nThree mine workers died in separate accidents on three straight days during the past week. The coal mining industry has not had three consecutive days of fatal accidents in more than a decade. The MSHA said it's too soon to draw any conclusions about the link between the shutdown and the accidents.  Still, the nation's largest mine workers union has raised alarms.\n\n\"The government's watchdog isn't watching,\" United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts said. \"Safety violations that would normally be caught and corrected as a result of those inspections are being missed. Even the smallest violations, when allowed to accumulate, can lead to dangerous conditions very quickly in a coal mine.\"\n\nFederal inspectors also have stopped most workplace checks. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board is only investigating accidents if officials believe lives or property are in danger.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration likewise has stopped routine inspections of food facilities in the United States and abroad. Border controls could be delayed. Food imports are still being inspected at borders, but any samples that need to be analyzed could be stalled because there are fewer scientists to analyze them.\n\n## CDC Stops Monitoring Flu\n\nThe CDC also has had to stop monitoring flu. That might not seem like a big deal. But the disease spreads  and it kills about 24,000 Americans a year.\n\nThis early in the flu season there is little illness. So there is little to test yet. But to fill in the gap, some state health departments have been receiving and testing samples that otherwise would have gone to the CDC, said Kelly Wroblewski of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nThe CDC also is slashing its officers stationed at 20 airports and U.S. entry points. When airline pilots or customs workers become aware of a sick traveler, they summon CDC officers. The officers can detain, examine and isolate people who might be a health threat to the U.S. public.\n\nEighty percent of those CDC officers have been dismissed from duty. There's essentially only one person working at each station, said Dr. Martin Cetron. He leads the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine. That could increase the possibility that some diseases could slip into the country at a time when measles is raging in Turkey and cholera is breaking out in Mexico.\n\nStill, many federal workers who protect safety and health are still working. Air traffic controllers, airport screeners and the majority of federal law enforcement are all on duty. People on active military duty are working. The USDA's agency responsible for investigating the poultry farm in California that is linked to the salmonella outbreak is also mostly staffed.\n\nBut the absence of workers matters, said Caroline Smith DeWaal. She is director of food safety advocacy at the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. She pointed out that it was hard for the public to get information on any outbreaks.\n\n\"These agencies are always running behind, and the idea that you can just shut them down is just foolish,\" said Smith DeWaal.'"

            "title": "Many types of frogs are going extinct; scientists are trying to learn why",
            "text": "\tMany scientists have tried to predict the future of Earth's endangered plants and animals. Yet, few studies have investigated those that already have become extinct.\n\nLooking backward is important for understanding how extinction rates have changed over time. It also identifies factors in the environment that have had an impact.\n\n## Losing Many Types Of Frogs\n\nNow, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two groups of animals - reptiles and amphibians. The results are alarming. Most importantly, the study found that approximately 200 frog species have already gone extinct, and hundreds more may be dying out.\n\nJohn Alroy is a science professor at the university and the paper's author. The study was inspired by the question of a journalist. Alroy was asked what scientists know about the number of species that have already gone extinct. \"I looked for a paper where they do this, and I didn't find one,\" Alroy said.\n\nSo he decided to write it himself. He chose reptiles and amphibians partly because there was a large amount of information available for these groups, and partly because scientists are increasingly concerned over frog populations, which are thought to be shrinking in many places. \"There was a very strong indication that I would get some frog extinctions,\" Alroy said.\n\n## On Pace For Mass Extinction\n\nAnd he did. Alroy estimated past extinctions for certain types of amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, snakes and lizards. He used museum collections and published documents to figure out when an animal was last seen and found that frogs seemed to be the most likely to become extinct. The results showed that more than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, largely since the 1970s.\n\nThe study suggests that about 200 frog species have gone extinct and hundreds more will be lost over the next century. \"So we are on pace to create a mass extinction,\" the study states.\n\nThe study also predicts that nearly 7 percent of frogs could be lost in the next century. Over a much longer time period, maybe thousands of years, there could be a global mass extinction of frogs, Alroy writes in the paper.\n\n## Tragedy In The Tropics\n\nIn fact, extinction rates for reptiles and amphibians seem to be about 10,000 times that for other life forms.\n\nIn general, though, frogs had the highest rate of extinction, with snakes and lizards about half that.\n\nWhat surprised Alroy was where the frogs became extinct.\n\nIn addition to large losses in Central America, Alroy also noted extinctions in Brazil, Madagascar and New Guinea. Alroy thinks that more frogs are going extinct in the tropics than scientists realize.\n\nScientists do not know what's been causing these extinctions, which seem to have been increasing in the past several decades. They could be due to a variety of factors. Reasons could include the destruction of their habitat, and the effects of a deadly fungus called atrachochytrium dendrobatidis on frogs. There wasn't a clear pattern. For instance, some places with high rates of extinction were also hotspots for the fungus, while in others scientists do not even know if the fungus was present.\n\n## What Is Killing Frogs?\n\nThat might be one of biggest problems of all. It means that scientists still do not have a clear idea of what's killing off all the frogs. \"Honest to goodness, I don't know what's going on,\" Alroy said. \"The pattern seems to be that there are more extinctions in the wet tropics.\" He called this \"not too surprising\" because the tropics have the most biodiversity, or the largest variety of different types of life found on Earth.\n\nBut that still does not answer the question of why the frogs are becoming extinct.\n\nAlroy said that scientists should look at the various environmental factors that may be causing extinctions in different locations. Then scientists might be able to start taking action to save them.\n\n## More Research Needed\n\nAlroy said scientists tend to focus strongly on the possible effects of climate change, the heating up of the earth. He added that climate change is likely to be an important factor in the coming years. However, \"we've already seen the beginning of a major mass extinction,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not saying we should stop looking at climate change,\" he added. However, he said that scientists should really look at other possible causes.\n\n\"So I'm hoping this paper will encourage more research of that kind.\"'"

The beast - found in southern Patagonia - was one of the largest creatures ever to have walked the Earth.\n\nThe hulking dinosaur stood two stories tall at its shoulder and weighed as much as seven Tyrannosaurus rex. It measured 85 feet from head to tail, including its 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long tail.\n\nScientists won't quite say that Dreadnoughtus is the largest dinosaur species that ever lived, but it is certainly right up there.\n\nIts name is a tribute to its gigantic size. \"Dreadnought,\" which means \"fearing nothing,\" was the word used to describe the mammoth battleships that ruled the seas in the early 20th century.\n\n## Too Big To Attack\n\nNothing could have attacked Dreadnoughtus and won, scientists say - it was simply too big.\n\nThe specimen found in Patagonia died sometime between 66 million and 84 million years ago. Scientists believe it weighed 65 tons. The dinosaur weighed more than a Boeing 737 airplane.\n\nWhat's more, at the time of its death, the gigantic creature was still growing.\n\nThe giant was discovered by Kenneth Lacovara, who is a paleontologist - a scientist who studies ancient animal remains, or fossils. Lacovara first stumbled on the bones of the Dreadnoughtus during a fossil-hunting trip in February 2005.\n\n\"I found a little cluster of broken-up bones and recorded it in my GPS,\" said Lacovara.\n\n## More Bones Uncovered\n\nEven after realizing that the bones were pieces of a giant thigh bone, Lacovara and his team weren't that excited at first.\n\nThen more bones started showing up. \"At that point we were getting excited,\" he said.\n\nThe bones themselves were enormous - the animal's shin bone, for example, was the length of a grown man.\n\nThe thrilling part, however, was that there were so many bones.\n\n\"Most sauropods are known by 10 bones,\" Lacovara said. \"We had 145.\"\n\nAfter all the bones were dug up, the researchers covered them in plaster and shipped them by boat to the U.S. It wasn't until the fossils had been cleaned that the researchers discovered they had bones from two different specimens.\n\n## The Titanosaurian Sauropods\n\nThe fossils will ultimately reside in a museum in Argentina, not far from where they were discovered. However, the research team has made 3-D laser scans of all the bones. The scans will allow other scientists to study the bones digitally. Unlike actual bones, the scanned images won't decay over time.\n\nPaleontologists are particularly excited about the find because the animals were so well preserved, particularly the larger one. More than 45 percent of that skeleton has been recovered, though its small skull is missing. Having an almost complete skeleton will allow scientists to better understand how these enormous animals moved around.\n\nDreadnoughtus belonged to a group of dinosaurs known as titanosaurian sauropods. They lived in the Southern Hemisphere during the final 30 million years of the age of the dinosaurs, which ended about 66 million years ago.\n\nThe animals would have had to eat almost all the time to sustain their colossal bodies. Lacovara imagines them as eating machines that used their long necks to graze on a wide variety of plant life.\n\nThe area where the fossils were found was once a forest. Several rivers ran through it, and Lacovara believes the two dinosaurs died when one of those rivers flooded and turned the solid ground nearby into something like quicksand. Then the huge animals probably sank to their deaths.\n\n## \"They Got Buried So Fast\"\n\nTheir early deaths were science's gain, however.\n\n\"The rapid burial is responsible for the extraordinary completeness and beautiful preservation of their bones,\" Lacovara said. \"We even see muscle scars on many of the bones, and that is because they got buried so fast.\"\n\nSteve Salisbury, an Australian dinosaur expert, noted that Patagonia has been the site of many important fossil finds. In ancient times, the region had numerous landslides and other events that both killed and entombed ancient giants. Under such conditions, skeletons tend to be well preserved.\n\nOver time, bits of those those fossilized skeletons are exposed naturally through erosion, he said.\n\nIn other words, more big discoveries may be on the way.'"

            "text": "\tAfter two years of arguments, protests and environmental studies, hunters will arrive Friday at the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. The refuge, a vast sweep of swamp and forest, runs west of U.S. Route 441 from Boca Raton to Wellington.\n\nThe hunters are coming with one purpose in mind: to kill some of the refuge's alligators.\n\nEleven hunters selected in a drawing were given permits to take down two alligators each. A total of 1,203 people had applied for permits.\n\nWorking primarily at night, they will be allowed to use various methods of killing the reptiles: large sticks with spears on the end called harpoons, spear guns, crossbows or a \"bang stick.\" The bang stick is a pole that shoots a bullet into the alligator's brain.\n\n## \"State-Sponsored Animal Killing\"\n\nThe hunt will run through October. When the first hunters arrive Friday, they will be greeted by protesters from the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, one of several groups opposed to the hunt.\n\n\"It's not a refuge if there's state-sponsored animal killing going on there,\" said Don Anthony, spokesman for the group. \"These animals are harpooned, stabbed or hooked and never die a quick or painless death. It's a bloody, violent and unnecessary activity in what should be a park that all Florida taxpayers can enjoy.\"\n\nRolf Olson, project leader at Loxahatchee, defended the hunt. He pointed out that hunting has been a traditional activity at wildlife refuges since the time of President Theodore Roosevelt. The president, who was a hunter himself, established the nation's first national wildlife refuge in 1903.\n\nFurthermore, Olson said, hunting is not new to Loxahatchee, as the refuge has long allowed duck hunting.\n\n## Enough Gators To Spare\n\nOlson said the alligator population at Loxahatchee is abundant. A recent survey at one canal in the hunt area, he added, found 134 of them.\n\n\"We've done a lot of surveying and monitoring of the alligator population,\" he said. \"We have enough alligators that we can have a harvest without affecting the total alligator population.\"\n\nHe said the protesters were welcome to express their opinions at the refuge, so long as they didn't interfere with the hunt.\n\n\"They have a First Amendment right to do that,\" he said. \"We will have a First Amendment area and they will be able to protest and speak their minds - as long as they don't\" break the law, \"they're allowed to be in the area.\"\n\nHe said the First Amendment area will not be hidden away and that any hunters arriving will see the protesters.\n\n## Law Officers To Supervise Hunt\n\nThe protest is planned at the refuge's south entrance on Loxahatchee Road, not at the visitor's entrance.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the final decision on the hunt in March. Although there are only a few permits being given out at first, the refuge has said the hunt may be expanded if all goes smoothly and it has little effect on the alligator population.\n\nThe refuge will have law enforcement officers from both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to supervise the hunt. Although only 11 people were issued permits, Olson said they are free to bring people with them to assist in the hunt.\n\nThe hunt is timed so that few if any visitors to the refuge will see any hunters, Olson said. It will take place only on Friday and Saturday nights. Hunters will be allowed in from an hour before sunset until an hour after sunrise.\n\n\"The majority of the hunters will be there when no one else is out there,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tIn the rings of ancient and gnarled trees, a team of scientists has found evidence of a period of constant warmth and wetness in Mongolia between 1211 and 1225. This was the exact time that Genghis Khan rose to power, on his way to building the Mongol Empire.\n\nA coincidence? They think not.\n\nMongolia is an area traditionally known for its cold and dry climate. The unusual stretch of mild temperatures and heavy rain would have made the grasslands in the Mongolian steppe more productive, the researchers say. The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of animals that could graze and live off it.\n\nMembers of Genghis Khan's army reportedly had five horses apiece. Having so many horses allowed them to swiftly conquer an enormous area because they were able to switch horses when one got tired. Khan's army also traveled with a herd of livestock that provided them with food. At its height, the Mongol Empire stretched from eastern Asia to eastern Europe, as well as parts of northern India and the Mideast.\n\n## \"Grass Was The Power Of The Day\"\n\n\"I think of it as nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat,\" said Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University. \"He didn't have to come eat, and he didn't have to eat the way he did, but the table was set.\" She added, \"It was a matter of whether or not the culture and the people capitalized on that.\"\n\nHessl's co-researcher, Neil Pederson of Columbia University, put it this way: \"Grass was the power of the day.\"\n\nThe story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees. Pederson and Hessl first discovered them unexpectedly during a research trip in 2010. The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia that was dotted with horse skeletons. The researchers said that because the trees are severely in need of water, they are especially affected by changes in the weather.\n\nOn that first trip, the two scientists took core samples from about a dozen trees. When they got them back to the lab, they discovered by looking at the rings inside the trees that some of those samples dated back more than 1,000 years. They also found evidence of a climate story that they couldn't ignore. For a small stretch of time, some of the rings were visibly thicker.\n\n## A Lucky Change In Climate\n\n\"I was just excited that we had wood from the time of (Genghis) Khan,\" Pederson said. \"And it was really the trees saying 'look how wide our rings are right here.'\"\n\nPederson and Hessl returned to the site two years later to sample more trees. Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The spread of the Mongolian empire happened along with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.\n\nIn interviews, Pederson and Hessl said there was still more work to be done to absolutely link the what the trees show with human events. They are working with experts from different fields of science and history. They're hoping to find more evidence of how the lucky change in climate may have contributed to the making of the largest empire in history.\n\n\"There are still a lot of unknowns out there,\" Pederson said. \"The climate information in the trees is just one little piece of the puzzle.\"'"

            "title": "California works to solve a growing problem: whales caught in fishing gear",
            "text": "\tLONG BEACH, Calif. - The waters of the Pacific Ocean are unusually warm this year. The change may spell bad news for whales, who swim through the waters off California when they migrate. Many of them are now colliding with fishermen.\n\nThis year alone, more than 60 whales have become entangled in fishing gear. That is a more than 400 percent spike over normal and a pattern that began in 2014. Scientists believe the whales may be following prey closer to shore as warm water influences feeding patterns. This puts them closer to fishermen, crabbers and lobstermen.\n\n## \"Never Seen Anything Like It\"\n\nThe situation is so serious that the crab fishery has begun working closely with state and federal agencies and environmental groups. Together they are trying to figure out where and how the whales are running into their gear. The ocean mammals also have become entangled in fishing nets and lobster gear, but authorities have identified crab fishing as the most urgent concern.\n\n\"This time of year, the whales would be offshore but with the blob of warm water, they're right off the beach. They're right where the crabs are,\" said Jim Anderson, a crabber. He is helping to assemble the state's 562 licensed Dungeness crab fishermen. \"You go talk to a guy who's been fishing for 40 or 50 years and he's never seen anything like it.\"\n\nWhales that have rope stuck in their mouths or wrapped tightly around their fins or tail cannot always free themselves. They will eventually die if not freed from the rope. Trained volunteer rescue teams are only able to disentangle a small percentage despite tracking devices that allow them to follow the animals for miles. Many swim away and their fate is never known.\n\n## Volunteer Rescuers Overwhelmed\n\nA humpback whale was partially freed recently off La Jolla, California. It had line stuck in its mouth. It also had a huge knot of rope 6 feet behind its tail and 200 additional feet of rope and buoys dragging behind it. Another rescued nearby had a 70-foot line looped over its tail that was connected to a lobster pot still swinging from the rope's end underwater.\n\nKeith Yip was involved in both rescues. He volunteers as the leader of a disentanglement team sponsored by SeaWorld. He has been called out four times in the past six weeks and has logged 10 rescues in the past two years - one-fifth of all the calls he's had in a 30-year career.\n\n\"It's another job in and of itself recently,\" said Yip, who is the curator of mammals at SeaWorld. \"My weekend days alone just the past couple of weeks I've spent on the water.\"\n\n## Trying To Catch Crabs, Not Whales\n\nDungeness crab fishing can bring in up to $100 million a season. Rather than crack down on it, state and federal agencies decided to tap into the crabbers' knowledge. They hope to figure out where whales and fishermen are overlapping. The crab season is delayed this year because of a massive bloom of toxic ocean plants in the Pacific. However, crabbers are committed to help when the season continues later this winter or next year.\n\nNearly 100 crabbers had a training session this fall in Half Moon Bay. They learned how to photograph tangled whales, call them in to a hotline and then \"babysit\" them until authorities arrive. A guide for handling whales has been distributed to all crabbers.\n\nWhen crabbing does continue, fishermen will work alongside scientists on their boats to test different strengths of rope and gear combinations. This includes a new \"sinking rope.\" It reduces slack in the line that could entrap whales. Another pilot program will log where crabbers drop their pots on GPS-enabled iPads.\n\n## Can Environmentalists Work With Fishermen?\n\n\"We've got pots in the water, we've got ropes in the water and we've got whales in the water,\"  Anderson said. \"What can we do to make this a safe place for everybody?\"\n\nEnvironmental groups are on board, too. In other cases, environmentalists and fishermen have clashed. \n\nIt is a promising start but ultimately might not be enough, said David Anderson, captain of Capt. Dave's Dolphin and Whale Watching Safari in Dana Point, California.\n\n## Whale Watchers On The Lookout\n\nAnderson has no relation to the crab fisherman. He was among the first to realize there was a serious problem under the water when his tours kept running into distressed whales.\n\nNow, a critical part of his work also involves documenting - and responding to - entangled whales off the Southern California coast. Anderson is certified by federal marine authorities as a volunteer rescuer. He believes the hobbled whales here are a symptom of a larger crisis.\n\n\"We've had more than 50 entangled whales this year off California, but that's just the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"Most of the whales we're not seeing - and it's a huge problem.\"'"

            "title": "After losing huge amount, Greenland ice is melting faster than ever",
            "text": "\tA new study has calculated just how much ice Greenland has lost since the year 1900. The number is astounding: 9,103 gigatons.\n\nA gigaton is a billion metric tons.  For reference, the Statue of Liberty weighs about 200 metric tons.\n\nThe study was completed by 16 authors and was published in the magazine Nature. The lead author was Kristian K. Kjeldsen of the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen. \n\nEstimating the loss of ice was not easy. It required the use of several information sources. These included the distinct marks left by retreating glaciers on the landscape, extensive aerial photography from 1978 through 1987, and satellite and aircraft observations beginning in 1983.\n\nAll were merged to provide the new ice loss estimates. \"It's the first observational-based study that shows where Greenland has lost its mass over the last 110 years,\" said Kurt H. Kj\\xc3\\xa6r, the paper's senior author.\n\n## How Greenland Affects Earth's Waters\n\nThe study offers a better understanding of how Greenland's ice loss has contributed to sea level rise. As the global temperature has gradually increased, ice in Greenland and throughout the Arctic has started to melt.  The melting ice has added to the volume of the oceans. Oceans all over the world have been affected, with water creeping higher onto the land. The study measures the effect Greenland's melting ice has had on sea levels.\n\nIt shows that the ice in Greenland is starting to melt more quickly. The amount of total ice loss doubled from 2003 to 2010 compared to ice loss throughout the 20th century (1900-1999). During this recent time period, an average of 186 gigatons of ice melted each year. Other estimates have put that number even higher. NASA currently states that Greenland is losing 287 billion tons of ice per year.\n\nThe study notes that ice melted in Greenland throughout the 20th century. The authors suggest that around 1900, the Earth started coming out of the Little Ice Age, a natural cool period. As the planet started warming, some ice began to melt. \n\n## Humans And Global Warming\n\nHowever, the speed of ice loss increased rapidly as major human-caused global warming kicked in. Most scientists believe that the release of greenhouse gasses, caused by human activities, has led to a dangerous increase in the Earth's temperature.\n\nSince 1900, the research finds, Greenland's major mass loss has been coming quite consistently from a few key regions. Much of the melting has come from the northwest and southeast of the ice sheet, the vast layer of ice that covers about 80 percent of Greenland. Ice has also been melting from the Jakobshavn glacier in the southwest, Greenland's single fastest moving glacier. It is currently losing 25 to 35 gigatons of ice annually.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the northeast of the ice sheet has started to melt as well. It features two major glaciers named Zachariae Isstr\\xc3\\xb8m and Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, which hold back 12 percent of all of Greenland's ice.\n\nThe new research suggests that the ice melting in Greenland has had a major effect on the rising sea level. The study estimates that 9,103 gigatons of ice have been lost from Greenland in the last 110 years. That would amount to a 2.5 centimeter of sea level rise. In other words, if the new study is correct, ice loss in Greenland has added an inch to the world's oceans.\n\n## The Inch Felt Round The World\n\nAn inch may not sound like much, but spread over the entire globe it is a staggering and dangerous amount of water. If Greenland's ice keeps melting, it could lead to disaster. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt, it would lead to roughly 20 feet of sea level rise.\n\nThe study also measured the amount of fresh water that has traveled into the North Atlantic ocean from Greenland and elsewhere. According to Jason Box, a professor with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, most of that melted water has probably stayed in the North Atlantic.\n\nThis could interfere with the Atlantic Ocean's water currents and circulation, which are driven by differences in temperature and saltiness. Cold salty water sinks in the North Atlantic and travels southward. This pulls more warm water north. If too much fresh water is added to the North Atlantic, however, it could slow or eventually shut down the circulation. This would have dramatic effects on the Earth's climate.\n\n## Keeping The Melt Under Control\n\nThe fact that so much ice in Greenland has melted, contributing fresh water to the oceans, is troubling, and the melting appears to be speeding up. The key for the future of Greenland's ice comes down to global warming. The big question is how high global temperatures will rise and how long they will stay there. \n\nLast month, world leaders met in Paris, France, and agreed to the goal of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit). If achieved, that may be enough to prevent all of Greenland's ice from melting.\n\nHowever, if the Earth gets much warmer than that, Greenland's ice will not last. \"The ice sheets are doomed in a plus-3-Celsius world,\" says Box.'"

            "title": "Earth's vast underground water supply saturated with valuable lessons",
            "text": "\tMost of us think of the water cycle as something that occurs above ground. Water falls from the sky, evaporates back into the atmosphere and then condenses into rain once again.\n\nBut the water that we see above ground is just a fraction of the story.\n\n## Invisible, But Drinkable\n\nHidden in the Earth's crust is a huge amount of groundwater. This water fell from the sky and then trickled into the cracks and crevices in the sand, gravel and rocks beneath our feet.  \n\nWe cannot see this groundwater, but more than 2 billion people across the globe rely on it for drinking water every day. In dry areas it is pumped out of the ground to grow crops. It also plays an important environmental role, keeping streams and rivers running in times of drought.\n\nBack in the 1970s a team of scientists estimated how much of the planet's water lies buried beneath the ground. That calculation had not been updated for 40 years - until now.\n\nIn a new study that appears in the magazine Nature Geoscience, researchers tried to estimate once again how much water is stored in our planet's crust. This time, they studied tens of thousands of additional locations. They also looked at the age of that water, or how long it had been underground. That information could help them understand how quickly it can be replaced as humans keep pulling it out of the ground.\n\n## That's A Lot Of Water!\n\n\"Our maps and estimates show where the groundwater is quickly being renewed and where it is old and stagnant and nonrenewable,\" said Tom Gleeson, who led the study. Gleeson is a hydrogeologist, someone who studies groundwater. He works at the University of Victoria in Canada.\n\nGleeson and his team report that there are 6 quintillion gallons of groundwater in the upper 1.2 miles of the Earth's crust. If you could magically pump it all out of the ground and spread it across the continents, it would form a layer of water 600 feet high. That's twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nTo determine that number, the scientists used computer models. They estimated how much water can be stored in various types of rocks across the planet. They used 40,000 separate measurements to come up with their results.\n\nThe researchers were also interested in the age of the groundwater and how it was distributed. Previous studies have shown that water that has made its way into the ground could have fallen from the sky as little as a day ago, or as long as millions - even billions - of years ago.\n\n## Just How Old Is The Groundwater?\n\nIn particular, the scientists wanted to know how much of the Earth's groundwater was \"modern.\" This younger water entered the ground system less than 50 years ago.\n\nResearchers say there are a variety of reasons why it is important to know how much modern groundwater there is. First, it is a more renewable resource than older ground water. In many parts of the world, humans are using groundwater faster than it can be replenished. Second, it is more likely to be contaminated by chemicals used in factories or agriculture. This would make it unhealthy for human consumption.\n\nTo see how much of groundwater is \"modern,\" they decided to look at how much tritium had been found in groundwater across the globe. Tritium is a radioactive isotope, or chemical element, of hydrogen. It increased in rain water approximately 50 years ago because of above-ground nuclear weapons testing.\n\nThe team reviewed many scientific studies. It eventually found 3,700 tritium measurements of groundwater from 55 countries.\n\n## Scientists Are Surprised\n\nFrom this information they determined that just 5.6 percent of groundwater is less than 50 years old. \n\nGleeson said the finding that modern groundwater was such a small percentage of overall groundwater was the biggest surprise of the study.\n\nYing Fan of Rutgers University, who was not involved in the work, wrote an article about the research. She said that the team's findings have several implications.\n\nFirst, it suggests that researchers could look at stored ancient water to learn about our planet's past. \n\n## The Flow Of History\n\nShe said that the study \"hints at the sluggishness and the vastness of the world's older groundwater stores.\" She believes they may record the history of climate and the crust over centuries, thousands, or even millions of years.\n\nShe also thinks the results of this study could help influence how we treat the supplies of modern, renewable water in the immediate future.\n\nGleeson said the next step for his team is to find out how much young groundwater is being used, and where.\n\n\"We want to find out how long before we run out of this critical resource,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES- California's Sierra Nevada and central coast mountain ranges are being pushed up, causing more earthquakes in one part of Central California. Scientists have a new theory about what is happening.\n\nThe scientists believe the earthquakes are triggered in part by the pumping of groundwater in the Central Valley. The Central Valley produces crops that feed the nation.\n\n\"These results suggest that human activity may give rise to a gradual increase in the rate of earthquake occurrence,\" said the study published in the journal Nature.\n\nThe scientists found that mountains closest to California's Central Valley were growing at a faster-than-expected rate compared to nearby ranges. The growth spurt - about 1 to 3 millimeters a year - was enough to lift them by half a foot over the last 150 years.\n\nGroundwater is very heavy, and presses on the Earth's upper crust like a weight. Remove that weight, and the Earth springs upward - and that change in pressure can trigger more small earthquakes, the researchers said.\n\n\"It reduces the forces that are keeping the fault clamped together - leading to more small earthquakes during dry periods of time,\" said Colin B. Amos, the study's lead author.\n\n## Thirsty Farms And Cities\n\nOther scientists studying a seismically active area of southern Monterey County observed that there are often more earthquakes during dry months than during wet months. The number of earthquakes there every year has roughly doubled between 1984 and 2005.\n\n\"During wet periods of time when the fault is loaded down, the forces that are keeping the fault clamped down are greater. It inhibits the sliding of the fault,\" Amos said.\n\nBut the question as to why earthquakes have been increasing in Parkfield over time has been a mystery. The groundwater theory introduced by Amos and his coworkers gives one possible answer.\n\nGroundwater has been slowly drained in the Central Valley to quench the thirst of farms and cities since the mid-1800s.\n\nThat irrigation has already caused dramatic changes. In the 1930s, water rerouting prompted the disappearance of Tulare Lake, once the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi River. Tulare Lake was 60 miles wide from end to end.\n\nOver the last 150 years, the Central Valley's groundwater reserve has lost about 38 cubic miles of water. That's enough to drain Lake Tahoe.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the nation's groundwater comes from Central Valley aquifers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It's the second-most-pumped aquifer system in the United States. The Central Valley produces one-quarter of the nation's food, including 40 percent of fruits, nuts and other food.\n\n## Studying The Fault\n\nThe study does not suggest the next Big One to hit Los Angeles or San Francisco will be caused by human activity, Amos said.\n\n\"Large earthquakes are going to occur on the San Andreas fault no matter what we do,\" Amos said. But what is important is the idea that human activity could trigger more seismic activity.\n\nThe San Andreas fault is a famous source of earthquakes. It runs from San Diego to San Francisco.\n\nU.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough said the idea that less groundwater can trigger earthquakes is very possible.\n\nHough went a step further than the researchers. She said it's possible that smaller earthquakes in the Parkfield area could eventually trigger larger earthquakes that head south toward Los Angeles.\n\n\"If you raise the rate of little earthquakes, you also raise the probability of a bigger earthquake,\" Hough said.\n\n## Trigger Earthquakes Elsewhere?\n\nParkfield was the starting point of a magnitude 7.9 earthquake that hit the San Andreas fault in 1857. The fault unzipped south for nearly 200 miles, down to the San Gabriel Mountains and ending in Wrightwood. That fault was so massive that shaking lasted from 1 to 3 minutes. Trees were uprooted and buildings were destroyed.\n\n\"As near as we can tell, the foreshocks were in the Parkfield area,\" Hough said.\n\n\"It won't necessarily happen that way\" again in our lifetime, she said. \"But the fact that it did happen once means that it could happen.\"\n\nHough said further study was needed to determine whether groundwater depletion in other areas could trigger earthquakes elsewhere. The part of the San Andreas fault around Parkfield is fairly weak. That means not much change in pressure is needed to loosen the fault and cause earthquakes.\n\nIn contrast, sections of the San Andreas closer to San Francisco and Los Angeles are much stronger and more locked.\n\nSteve Ingebritsen, a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, called the theory interesting. But he said that more study was needed. He called the suggestion that less groundwater could lead to more earthquakes \"somewhat controversial.\"'"

Most of the deep-sea fishing in the high seas is done by bottom trawling, in which heavy nets are scraped across the seafloor. These nets sweep up everything in their path. They destroy fragile marine ecosystems, such as deepwater corals and sponges that give shelter to fish. Much of the nets' catch, called its bycatch, is thrown back dead.\n\nTo prevent overfishing, the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas.\n\nMPAs are the oceans' national parks. They range in size and level of protection. Twelve percent of the world's land is currently protected in national parks and wildlife preserves. In contrast, just about 1 percent of the high seas is protected. The plan is to increase this number to 10 percent by 2020 and eventually to 30 percent.\n\n\"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas, instead of what we extract,\" says Karen Sack. She is the director of The Pew Charitable Trusts' International Marine Program. Sack has been involved in the discussions to create an agreement since their beginning in 2004.\n\n## Who's Watching The Oceans?\n\nAn uncoordinated jumble of institutions and regulations have control over different aspects of the high seas. There's the International Maritime Organization for shipping. For mining, there's the International Seabed Authority. For fishing, it is the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. A recent report by the Global Ocean Commission found that too many different agencies have made it virtually impossible to safeguard the high seas.\n\nThe commission called on countries to quickly agree on a set of rules for the high seas. Other problems include government support of deep-sea fishing, lack of tracking for fishing vessels, offshore oil and gas exploration and plastics pollution.\n\nIf these rules do not go into effect within five years, the commission suggests closing the high seas to fishing. \"This proposal is not anti-fishing,\" says Remi Parmentier, commission deputy executive secretary.\n\nCoastal states would benefit, he said. Many of them are suffering economically, because fish are being killed off by high-seas fishing fleets. This is especially the case in West Africa.\n\nMatthew Gianni is the co-founder of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. He fears a complete closure may lead countries to expand their coastal zones, where they have exclusive rights to fish. Countries' coastal zones extend 200 nautical miles into the ocean. The high seas lay beyond this point, in international waters.\n\n\"There's a lot of merit to collective regulation,\" said Gianni, whose environmental group aims to save the high seas.\n\n## \"Biggest Savings Account\"\n\nYet, the evidence in favor of closing the high seas is growing. Earlier in February, a study from the University of British Columbia (UBC) suggested this would have ecological, economic and social benefits.\n\nResearchers found that closing the high seas would actually increase the amount of fish caught annually. A greater number of countries would catch these fish within their coastal areas. This would make the high seas the \"biggest savings account on the planet.\" Major fishing nations, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, rely on high-seas bottom trawling. They would lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n\nIf the agreement is successfully negotiated, there may be no need for closing down the high seas to fishing. This is because some key areas would be set aside for marine protection. Also, areas outside the MPAs would be closely studied. These would help ensure that the high seas' health is maintained in the long run. \"I realize what we have lost,\" says Enric Sala. The deep-sea diver is a National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence and co-author of the UBC paper.\n\n\"I also see what the ocean of the future can be,\" added Sala. \"It's the difference between the places that are degraded, and places that are pristine and beautiful that gives us hope.\"'"

            "title": "Dams hold danger of floods when strong earthquakes hit Himalayas",
            "text": "\tEarthquakes can create massive amounts of damage. The people of Nepal, a nation of 27 million located in the Himalayan mountain range south of China, know this all too well. Earlier this year, two massive earthquakes struck in the Himalayas, killing more than 8,500 people.\n\nThe people of Nepal are still recovering. Scientists, meanwhile, are already worrying about the next earthquakes that will strike the region. One growing concern has to do with the dams in the Himalayas. More than 600 large dams have been built or are in some stage of construction or planning in the mountains. Scientists are worried that a large earthquake could cause some of the dams in the Himalayas to burst. A burst dam would release a sudden flood of water, posing a grave threat to local communities.\n\n## Nepal Quakes Caused Damage\n\nThe 2015 earthquakes that hit Nepal cracked or damaged several dams. The next earthquake could be even stronger. According to a number of engineers and scientists, many of the dams in the Himalayas are probably not strong enough to withstand the worst earthquakes that could hit the region.\n\nBurst dams would unleash huge quantities of water, which would rush down through the mountains toward towns and cities. A collapse of Tehri Dam in the central Himalayas, for instance, would set loose a wall of water about 650 feet high. The water would hit two towns. The flooding would affect six additional cities with a combined population of 2 million.\n\nEarthquakes occur in the region because of the movement of layers of rock miles below the surface. According to the theory of plate tectonics, different pieces of the earth's crust (\"plates\") are in slow, steady motion. One plate below Nepal, the Indian plate, is pushing under the Asian plate. It moves roughly 6 feet per century, but it regularly gets stuck. This leads to a build-up of pressure. When the pressure reaches a certain level, the plates become unstuck, causing an earthquake. The Himalayas are located on a \"fault line,\" an area where two plates push against each other below the surface. Because of its location in the Himalayas, Nepal experiences earthquakes.\n\n## \"Great\" Earthquake Seen As Likely\n\nLaurent Bollinger is a seismologist, a scientist who studies earthquakes, at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission. He has studied the effects of the earthquakes that hit Nepal earlier this year. According to Bollinger's research, the earthquakes destabilized the region, making a \"great\" earthquake more likely to occur in the future. A \"great\" earthquake is any earthquake that scores an 8.0 or higher on the Richter scale. The Richter scale rates the strength of earthquakes from 0 to 10. The two earthquakes that hit Nepal in April and May 2015 were measured as 7.8 and 7.3, respectively.\n\nOther studies indicate that these earthquakes released only a fraction of the pressure that has built up between the plates below the Himalayas. This suggests that more earthquakes are likely in the coming years. Vinod K. Gaur is a seismologist at the CSIR Fourth Paradigm Institute in India. He says that there could be a 8.0 earthquake in the Himalayas in the near future. If there are no earthquakes for 200 years, the pressure will keep increasing. When an earthquake finally comes, it will be even more powerful.\n\nGiven the likelihood of more earthquakes in Nepal, the dams in the region have to be specially reinforced. They must be able to withstand the strong ground shaking of an extreme earthquake, says Martin Wieland of the International Commission on Large Dams.\n\n## India, China Secretive About Dam Designs\n\nPart of the trouble is that scientists are not always allowed to study the dams freely to determine whether or not they are strong enough. Most of the dams in the region supply power to India and China. Although every nation has its own regulations, India and China are secretive about their dam designs. Outsiders are rarely allowed to examine Indian and Chinese dams.\n\nScientists who have been able to study dams in the region have sometimes found cause for concern. Probe International is a Canadian environmental research organization. It studied China's Three Gorges Dam. It found that the designers had not considered worst-case scenarios when designing the dam's earthquake resistance.\n\n## Scientists Seek Safer Construction\n\nIf the Indian and Chinese governments have not put in place the proper reinforcements, hundreds of dams could be in danger of bursting when the next big earthquake hits the Himalayas. If that happens during a rainy season, when the dams are full, the burst dams could create massive damage.\n\nA handful of scientists have taken the lead in arguing for safer dam construction. They have only had limited success, though. For now, all they can do is call attention to the problem.\n\nScientists hope that, with the help of public pressure, dams in the Himalayas will be reinforced to withstand great earthquakes. Otherwise, the next great earthquake in the area may result in a man-made tsunami.'"

            "title": "A fall in horseshoe crabs leads to a drop in shorebirds",
            "text": "\tMIAMI - Every spring, thousands of horseshoe crabs make their way ashore when the moon is bright. From Florida to New Jersey, they lay millions of eggs that provide food for migrating shorebirds.\n\nBut in the 1990s, their numbers began falling. Scientists aren't sure why but they suspect there are three reasons: fishing, loss of habitat and a global demand for the crabs' sky-blue blood. Their blood is used to check for toxins in injectable drugs.\n\nIn nature, one thing is almost always connected to another. The falling number of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food.\n\nThe crabs' prime mating season is now underway in Florida and the government is asking the public for help studying them. Researchers hope more information on the crabs' nighttime activities will help them count the crabs and understand their habits.\n\n## Relative Of The Spider\n\n\"It's a really cool creature,\" said Tiffany Black, a state biologist at the Sen. George Kirkpatrick Marine Lab in Cedar Key, Fla. \"It helps people. But it's one of these things that's maligned and overlooked, and the more information the better.\"\n\nEvery spring, Florida's wildlife agency collects numbers on crab sightings around the state. Since 2002, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times. That's enough to get an idea about where they may be located, but not enough to tell researchers about populations, Black explained.\n\n\"If we can get people working regularly, even if just for a few months of the year, from March, on a full moon ... that shows us something,\" she said.\n\nThe horseshoe crab is not really a crab at all but a relative of the spider. It is one of the oldest unchanged species on Earth known to scientists. It's older than the continents, and exists only in parts of Asia and North America's Atlantic coast.\n\nFor most of the crab's history, the world regarded it as junk from the sea. Bounties were sometimes placed on its helmeted head to stop it from eating clams. And in the mid-1800s, between 1.5 million and 2 million were caught yearly to use as fertilizer and livestock feed.\n\n## In The Blood\n\nThen in 1956, a biologist working at the Woods Hole Marine Biology Lab discovered something amazing about the crab's blood.\n\nWhen a crab was infected with a toxin, its blood immediately clotted to isolate the threat. Even if the blood was removed from the crab, the blood would still clot if it detected a toxin. That meant the blood could be used as a \"fire alarm\" to detect similar threats to humans.\n\nAs a result, the blood became very valuable and a \"bleeding\" industry was born. The crabs are caught and their hearts pierced to drain about 30 percent of their blood before they are tossed back into the sea.\n\nBut in the 1990s, scientists began noticing a sharp decline in a shorebird called the Red Knot. The Red Knot makes a two-week stop along the New Jersey and Delaware shores on its way to the Arctic from Argentina. The birds precisely time their pit stop to when the crabs are spawning so that they can eat the crabs' eggs.\n\nThe spawning is a carefully choreographed procession toward shore. The males swim parallel to the beach and the females take the more direct approach to shore.\n\nWhen the females cross the \"stag line,\" they pick up a mate, then tow it in. Males who don't find a mate may become \"satellites.\" That means they circle the couple and help fertilize the eggs, according to University of Florida researcher Jane Brockmann, who has spent 25 years studying the crabs in the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n## Red Knot In Trouble\n\nEach year, the female crab can lay up to 90,000 eggs, creating a feast for the Red Knot. But without the eggs, as a 12-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey found in 2011, the birds are unable to make the second leg of their journey to their Arctic mating grounds. Since the 1990s, their numbers have fallen by 75 percent.\n\nThe crabs spawn year-round in Florida, although their prime mating season occurs between March and May.\n\nBleeding the crabs for medical purposes likely only accounts for a small part of the falling numbers. Crabs who are bled have a 15 percent chance of dying.  But a recent study found that it may slow down the females and make it harder for them to make the long swim toward shore.\n\nCatching them for bait or aquariums may have had a larger effect. Until 1998, catches were unregulated and the largest hauls were in the Mid-Atlantic states where the country's five bleeding companies are located. Then in 1998, the states on the Atlantic coast put a limit on the number of crabs that could be caught.\n\n\"They basically reduced harvests along the coast to address the fact that birds need the eggs,\" said Marin Hawk, who oversees the states' fishing plans.'"

            "title": "Wild mustangs in the U.S. West will be rounded up this summer",
            "text": "\tThe federal government and animal supporters are fighting again over the removal of wild mustangs from the Western range, even after the government announced plans to take fewer horses from the land this summer.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said last week that it would remove 1,300 horses in the coming months, many of which might otherwise die from lack of food and water. The announcement comes even though it has almost reached the limit of the 50,000 wild horses it has room to hold.\n\nAnimal advocates say 1,300 horses are still too many. They question the bureau's reasons for the removals.\n\nThe BLM is responsible for 264 million acres across the United States. It has said previously there are too many horses on the wild range for the lands to sustain. Supporters of wild horses say this is not true. They argue that the agency is really helping ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze upon the public lands.\n\n## Drought Hurting Horses\n\nNine of the BLM's 16 summer roundups will be conducted in Nevada. The state is home to roughly half of the estimated 37,000 free-roaming wild horses and burros in the West.\n\nOn Tuesday, the agency said it would relocate 50 wild horses threatened by drought from an area two hours north of Las Vegas. BLM officials said some animals that are suffering might have to be killed.\n\n\"The drought conditions are so severe we're going to see die-offs,\" BLM spokesman Tom Gorey said.\n\nThe BLM has been closely monitoring the drought. Since early July, it has been filling tubs and troughs with water and providing hay to the horses.\n\nUnfortunately, these animals are extremely skittish and will not drink from the man-made containers. Even with the extra water, the ground does not provide enough water to keep them alive, Gorey said.\n\n\"It's contrary to the cliche - we're bringing the water to the horse, but the animals still won't drink it,\" he said. \"Horses will die. It's not going to be pretty.\"\n\n## Bureau's Policy Called A Failure\n\nThe BLM has been under fire for what many have called its failing policies toward wild horses. The animals have been blamed for range damage. But there are far more cattle grazing on the land.\n\nAn independent scientific review of the agency's horse roundup recommended that the government spend money to cut down on the number of mustangs being born. It should also let nature thin the herds, not spend millions to house horses in overflowing holding pens, the study said.\n\nThe panel said BLM's removal of nearly 100,000 horses from the Western range over the last decade is probably having the opposite effect of its intention to ease damage and reduce overpopulated herds.\n\nIn June, 30 members of the House of Representatives urged new U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to reform the government's wild horse management program and its growing budget. A big part of the budget goes to the high cost of corralling and removing the animals from the range.\n\nFor the 12 months that end in September, the BLM plans to remove 4,800 mustangs from the range. That is down from 8,255 in the last year, Gorey said. The reduction is due to overstocked corrals.\n\nThe American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign coalition criticized the bureau's plans.\n\n\"The BLM is galloping ahead with rounding up more wild horses, despite the high cost to taxpayers and animals as well as the findings of an independent scientific review, which recommends against continued roundups,\" said coalition spokeswoman Suzanne Roy.\n\n## Helicopters, And Bait And Water\n\nSix of the Nevada roundups will use helicopters to drive the animals to pens. The rest of the operations will use bait and water to trap them in corrals.\n\nSally Summers is founder of the Reno-based group Horse Power. The group has called for a stop to the capturing of horses and burros. She said the BLM's planned areas for its water traps is the same area that is at the center of a lawsuit by supporters for better monitoring access of helicopter roundups.\n\n\"They're doing water traps because they knew we won't have access to monitor what they're doing,\" Summers said. \"Do they make sure there is enough water in those traps? Do they check them enough times a day to collect horses out in the middle of the heat? We won't know, because they won't let us near those traps to watch their tactics.\"\n\nShe added: \"The BLM is tired of people picking it apart. They want to do what they do in secrecy.\"\n\nGorey lashed back at critics.\n\n\"On one hand, they imply that if Mother Nature kills off the horses from thirst or starvation, that's OK,\" he said. \"But if we intervene to save these horses, that's unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Where is the reasoning in that argument? I don't see it,\" he said. '"

            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - Horticulture experts usually prefer to gush about the beauty of flowers and the joys of growing vegetables. So when six of the most important people in the field made a warning, the words were shocking: \"Horticulture is under siege.\"\n\nThey were worried that horticulture, the study of plants, is in trouble. So the six wrote an alarming letter in December. It went to 800 schools and universities, government agencies, business associations, and growers of everything from almonds to onions to zucchini.\n\nThe letter warns that something must be done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field. Or else, it said, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science. It outlined a plan of action.\n\n\"Think of all the careers horticulture is competing against,\" said Paul B. Redman, director of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa.. He is a strong supporter of the four-year campaign outlined in the letter, which calls for:\n\nA scientific study of the problem so that horticulture experts can prove what they already believe to be true, that not enough people are getting into the field;\n\nA plan outlining how horticulture can be woven into lessons in grades K-12 and promoted at colleges:\n\nRaise public awareness of horticulture's importance. Inform people about careers in horticulture.\n\n## From Plant Breeding To Biofuel Research\n\n\"We have to come up with a game plan. Period,\" said Redman, who has been in horticulture for 30 years.\n\nBy the book, horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants. But Mary H. Meyer, a horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and a major force in the campaign, said people don't really understand what being a horticulturist means.\n\nShe described the mistaken impression people have. \"It's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree,\" Meyer said. She is also president of the American Society for Horticultural Science.\n\nHorticulture offers many career opportunities, she said. She ticked off a few, including plant breeding, greenhouse and food production, and the cut-flower, landscape and nursery industries. There's also caring for public gardens, parks and sports turf. And there are many fields of research for people who are interested in plants, including global climate change, plant pests and diseases, water quality, biofuels, and food safety. They can even study how plants benefit people's minds and bodies.\n\nThis crisis is not unique to the United States. While teaching in England over the summer, Meyer discovered that the world's horticultural powerhouse was facing the same concerns. So much so that the Royal Horticultural Society decried in a report in May that there were not enough skilled professionals in horticulture jobs. It called the situation \"alarming.\"\n\nHorticulturists in both countries say the crisis has been building for years. It's been greatly influenced by globalization, which means that people can buy food and flowers from distant parts of the world. Further, the population shift from farm to city, and the loss of a personal connection to the land, have added to the crisis.\n\n## Young City Farmers Offer Hope\n\nMatthew Bond, 21, a plant sciences major at Cornell University, found his future the old-fashioned way. He grew up in farm country in Ogdensburg, N.Y., where his father and grandmother were enthusiastic gardeners.\n\nBond, an officer of the National Junior Horticultural Association since 2009, is worried that the group's membership has plummeted from 1,000 in the '60s to half that number 15 years ago to 300 today. He suggests today's heavily scheduled kids have little time for hobbies like gardening. \"They don't even go outside,\" he said.\n\nBut Bond said there are signs that horticulture may be getting some much-needed energy. He pointed out interest among young people in farming in cities. More young people are also interested in organic food production, a method that involves avoiding the use of chemicals.\n\nPauline Hurley-Kurtz, who chairs the landscape architecture and horticulture program at Temple University, says student interest in traditional horticulture is holding steady. That includes ornamental shrubs, trees and plants. Giving her hope, she said, is that practical courses have become extremely popular in the last two or three years. Among them: growing food, native plants, restoring landscapes, the study of trees in cities, and even beekeeping.\n\nA challenge is getting people interested in horticulture early, said Jessica McAtamney, who teaches environmental science and gardening in cities at W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia. \"There's nothing sexy about plant science until you make it so for kids,\" she said. But, McAtamney added, \"Once you do, they're hooked.\"\n\nHydeia Brown, 17, from Philadelphia's Germantown, could be the poster child for an idealized horticultural future. There would not only be more practitioners but more diversity, too. An environmental science major in Saul's horticulture program, Brown wants to make a career out of plants.\n\n\"I love science,\" she said in a phone interview from Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia. Her class was photographing and cataloging the Latin botanical names of pitch pine, American holly, and other trees.\n\nBrown, whose family left their South Carolina farm to move north before she was born, wishes \"other kids would come out and experience this. Not a lot of them know about the outdoors. They like electronics and stuff like that.\"\n\nDouglas C. Needham, education department head at Longwood, said, \"I'm passionate about this. I don't want to see the art, science, and craft of horticulture die out.\"'"

            "title": "Study finds that off-the-charts hurricanes are possible but not likely",
            "text": "\tThe nation recently focused its attention on the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. It was the most destructive hurricane in U.S. history. However, it wasn't the worst storm that could have possibly hit New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThat's true of many other places, too. Now, in a new study, Princeton University's Ning Lin and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kerry Emanuel demonstrate that in three global cities there could come a storm that is much worse than anything in memory. The three cities are Tampa, Florida; Cairns, Australia; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\n## Predicting The Probability Of A \"Gray Swan\"\n\nThese theoretical storms are also highly unlikely to occur. In some cases, they could happen once every 10,000 years or even less often. The researchers call these possible storms \"gray swans.\" The term is a play on the idea of a \"black swan\" event, which is an unpredictable disaster. A \"gray swan,\" by contrast, can actually be predicted, even though it is extremely rare.\n\nThe purpose of the study is \"to raise awareness of what a very low probability, very high impact hurricane event might look like,\" said Emanuel. The storms were generated by a special computer program. It took into account hurricane patterns and predictions about global warming. The program allowed the researchers to look at many different possible storms in the made up, or simulated, world.\n\n## Asteroid Could Leave \"Hypercane\" In Its Wake\n\n\"When you do hundreds and hundreds of thousands of events, you're going to see hurricanes that are unlike anything you've seen in history,\" said Emanuel. He developed math equations that show how strong a hurricane can be. He said that a hurricane with winds approaching 500 mph is possible if an asteroid hits Earth. Hurricanes gather their energy from water evaporating over warm ocean surfaces, and an asteroid strike could heat up ocean waters far beyond their normal temperature. Emanuel called this possible event a \"hypercane.\"\n\nSo what did the researchers see in the future? Let's take Tampa Bay. It hasn't been hit by a major hurricane since 1921. That storm drove a 3- to 3.5-meter storm surge, or a 10- to 11-foot flood, on the coast, and caused dramatic damage. In 1848, another storm produced a surge of 4.6 meters, or about 15 feet.\n\n## West Coast's Shallow Water Endangers Florida City\n\nWhy is Tampa Bay in such danger? The water on Florida's east coast is very deep. But it is more shallow on Florida's west coast. The city of Tampa may be far from the barrier islands that get battered by the waves from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is more exposed than it seems.\n\nSurges can be much larger from shallow water, Emanuel said. Surges can also be bigger when they move into a bay, a body of water bordered on most sides by land that opens into the sea.\n\nThe new computer model allows the researchers to show that a worse storm than these historical examples is possible. It is especially possible with sea levels rising and global warming. The researchers looked at 2,100 possible Tampa Bay hurricanes in the current climate. Then they simulated 3,100 each for three time periods. They used 2006 through 2036, 2037 through 2067, and 2068 through 2098. The researchers assumed global warming would continue unstopped.\n\nIn the current climate, the study found that a 5.9-meter, or 19-foot, storm surge is possible in a strong hurricane following a similar track to Tampa's 1921 and 1848 storms. Moreover, in a late 21st century climate with bad global warming, the worst-case scenario followed a very different path. The storm would move north along Florida's Gulf Coast. Then it would turn inland at Tampa. That storm could cause a surge of nearly 11.1 meters, or nearly 37 feet.\n\n## Chances Of A Super Storm Are Very Low\n\nGranted, the study said that these two \"gray swans\" are exceedingly unlikely. The chances are less than 1 in 10,000 years for the 19-foot surge in the current climate. Still, the study also showed that global warming makes the worst possible surges more likely.\n\nThe study also shows that for Cairns, Australia, a 5.7-meter, or 18-foot, storm surge is possible in the current climate. Such flooding would happen less than once in 10,000 years. Perhaps most strikingly, it also suggests that an extremely powerful hurricane could happen where we've never yet seen hurricanes occur: the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe waters in the Persian Gulf are very hot, meaning there is a lot of energy for a possible hurricane, though the atmosphere is normally too dry for hurricanes, Emanuel explained. \"It's not likely, but it's not impossible,\" he said.\n\nThe study found that with 3,100 simulated events in today's climate, it is theoretically possible to get a hurricane with winds of more than 250 mph and a storm surge of 24 feet in Dubai. The hurricane would be stronger than anything we've seen on Earth.\n\nSo, is all of this just a mathematical exercise? Or is it more important? In the end it's up to us to decide how much to worry about an extraordinarily rare event, but you could make the case that a study like this helps us think a lot better about what risk is all about.'"

But this year the monsoon arrived two weeks ahead of schedule, causing widespread disaster.\n\n## \"Next 24 Hours\" Crucial\n\nIndian weather officials said rescue efforts would be compounded by heavy rains expected in the region from Monday.\n\n\"The next 24 hours will be crucial for rescue operations,\" Pandey said.\n\nUttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna said it would take another 15 days to complete the region's evacuation.\n\n\"Our priority remains evacuation and emergency supplies to those who are stuck,\" said Anil Chait, an army general who is heading the operations. The army was trying to repair roads and make temporary bridges to restore land-links to the cut-off areas.\n\nA private helicopter being used to rescue stranded people crashed late Friday. There were no casualties.\n\nKedarnath, a revered Hindu temple, had turned into a graveyard, with bodies buried in the rubble surrounding the shrine.\n\n\"The center of faith has turned into a burial ground. Bodies are scattered in the area,\" state agriculture minister Harak Singh Rawat told reporters.\n\nNumerous accounts of death and destruction have emerged in the disaster's aftermath.\n\nRadhey Shyam, a pilgrim to Kedarnath, was the sole survivor in his family. Thirteen of his relatives were killed.\n\n## Family \"Swept Away\"\n\n\"My wife, my daughter and relatives were all swept away by the floods. Nobody is alive,\" he told broadcaster NDTV. \"Scores of people have climbed hill-slopes and are in forests, who need to be helped and rescued as soon as possible.\"\n\nKB Rana's three-story business complex was swept away by the raging Mandakini river: \"I have lost all that I had. It was washed away by the floods in a matter of minutes.\"\n\nOther survivors complained that locals refused them shelter while shopkeepers were overcharging for bottled water and biscuits.\n\n\"We were scared of dying and just kept running for our lives. We don't know how many kilometers we ran. People kept telling us to run to save our lives,\" another survivor said.\n\nAngry relatives blocked roads outside the Jolly Grant airport in the state capital, protesting at the lack of help and information from authorities.\n\n\"I have been here for the past three days to get some information about my missing father and mother. But there is no official here to help us. It's an endless wait,\" Brajesh Singh said.\n\nIndian media said large-scale construction, mining and power projects in India's northern Himalayan states had contributed to the worst floods in the region in 60 years.\n\nThe disaster was \"man-made\" because environmental laws had been ignored, broadcaster NDTV said.\n\n\"The growing frequency of extreme\" weather adds to the evidence that dams,  building near riverbeds, and blasting of mountains to build roads are putting India's mountainous states at risk of disaster, the Times of India wrote.'"

            "title": "Ancient cave art on two continents is about the same age",
            "text": "\tArchaeologists say prehistoric cave paintings in Indonesia were created nearly 40,000 years ago.\n\nTheir great age suggests that Europe can no longer claim to be the sole birthplace of art.\n\nThe images of hands and animals were reported in limestone caves on the island of Sulawesi just east of Borneo, by Dutch archaeologists in the 1950s. They had never been dated until now. For decades researchers thought the cave art was made during the pre-Neolithic period, about 10,000 years ago. Now, it's clear they were painted about the same time as the earliest known art found in the caves of northern Spain and France.\n\nThe findings were published this week in the journal Science.\n\n## Rock Art Dating\n\n\"We now have 40,000-year-old rock art in Spain and Sulawesi,\" said Adam Brumm. He is a research fellow at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, and one of the lead authors of the study. He said he expects more cave paintings to be found in other places that are as old, if not older.\n\n\"I can say that it was a great - and very nice - surprise to read their findings,\" said Wil Roebroeks, an archaeologist from Leiden University in the Netherlands. Roebroeks was not involved in the study. \"'Wow!' was my initial reaction to the paper,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers said they had no idea how old the rock art was when they started on the project about three years ago. They just wanted to know the date for sure.\n\nTo do that, the team relied on a relatively new way of dating called U-series dating. The method was also used to establish the age of rock art in Western Europe.\n\n## Hand Tracings And Animals\n\nFirst they looked for painted images that had small, white, cauliflower-like growths covering them. Eventually, they found 14 of them, including 12 outlines of hands and two drawings of animals.\n\nThe white growths - called cave popcorn - are made of minerals that are left behind by thin streams of water that run down the walls of a cave. These mineral deposits also have small traces of the radioactive element uranium in them. Uranium breaks down over time at a set rate to produce another radioactive element called thorium.\n\n\"The ratio between the two elements acts as a kind of geological clock to date\" the deposits, explained Maxime Aubert. He is an expert on dating cave paintings at the University of Wollongong in Australia's New South Wales state.\n\nUsing a tool with a diamond blade, Aubert cut into the cave popcorn. He then removed small samples that included some of the color from the cave paintings. A paint sample would be at least as old as the first layer of mineral deposit that grew on top of it.\n\nUsing this method, the researchers determined that one of the hand outlines was made at least 39,900 years ago. A painting of an animal called a pig deer was at least 35,400 years old.\n\n## Taking Art To New Lands\n\nIn Europe, the oldest known cave painting was of a red disk found in a cave in El Castillo, Spain. Ancient humans painted it at least 40,800 years ago. The earliest painting of an animal, a rhinoceros, was found in the Chauvet Cave in France. It dates back 38,827 years.\n\nArchaeologists have two theories of how humans came to make art at roughly the same time on different continents.\n\nEach group may have come up with idea of cave art at the same time, although independently of each other. More interesting, however, is the possibility that art was already part of an even earlier human culture. These two groups brought the art know-how with them as they migrated to new lands.\n\nThe study clearly disproves the theory that humans in Europe were only ones making art 40,000 years ago.\n\nRoebroeks said that the old \"Europe, the birthplace of art\" story was too simplistic to be true. \"We have seen a lot of surprises in paleoanthropology over the last 10 years, but this one is among my favorites.\"'"

            "title": "Traditions make Inuit, their at-risk Arctic environment, one and the same",
            "text": "\tANCHORAGE, Alaska - Oogruk, or the bearded seal, is a marine mammal prized for its meat, oil and hide. Inuit John Goodwin hunts oogruk and is one of approximately 35,000 of the native people in Alaska. In some places, the Inuit are also known as Eskimos. They live in the Arctic region, which includes parts of Alaska, a few European countries and Russia. \n\nThe oogruk are the largest of Alaska's ice seals. The animals use sea ice to rest and to birth pups. After the long winter, ice breaks into floes, or sheets of floating ice near Goodwin's home, the small city of Kotzebue, Alaska. Goodwin has only a short time to hunt. Soon the seals will migrate north through the Bering Strait, a waterway that connects the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea.\n\nA hunting season that used to last weeks is shorter now, and ice that used to freeze to at least 5 feet thick is now just a fraction of that. Goodwin says, \"As soon as the sun comes out, it starts melting, or we have a heavy rain. Basically, it's the rain that deteriorates the ice real quick. We don't have enough time to hunt.\" \n\n## Group Seeks To Protect Villages\n\nThe Inuit consider themselves to be part of the environment. They want to protect their culture as global warming, the heating up of the Earth's climate, takes a toll. It is a threat to food security, or people having a way to get enough safe and healthy food.\n\nThe Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska looks out for coastal villages in the state. The group recently issued a report asking for laws to protect Inuit traditional food and the Arctic environment. The study included visits to 15 Inuit villages and contributions by 146 authors. Carolina Behe is the organization's expert on native knowledge and science matters. She says, \"When we say food security, it has to do with the health of all of it.\" \n\nMore than 90 percent of the food in Alaska comes in from elsewhere. A reliable food supply in bigger cities like Anchorage means affordable prices. It also means groceries shipped north by barge or jet. However, for the Inuit, who have survived for thousands of years in one of the harshest climates on Earth, food is a connection to the past.\n\n## Food Traditions Tied To Nature\n\nFor thousands of years, food traditions such as hunting seals and gathering salmonberries were passed on through the arts and language. Visual art, storytelling, dance and drumming helped preserve the culture. The report states, \"Our traditional foods are much more than calories or nutrients; they are a lifeline throughout our culture and reflect the health of the entire Arctic ecosystem.\"\n\nInuit leaders spoke about food at public hearings when the climate began to change. Their description of secure food differed from ideas held by lawmakers, who spoke of nutritional value and purchasing power. \"They were talking two different languages,\" says Behe.\n\nBehe remembers a meeting where someone asked whether the Inuit were looking forward to increased shipments of food. She says, \"Our people were saying the exact opposite. We're really concerned about these ships because they're going to disrupt our hunting, the noise is disrupting the animals, the pollutants, and that's a threat to food security.\"\n\nBehe also says that the report asks lawmakers to make Arctic policy decisions with food security in mind. When lawmakers look at information on the Arctic ecosystem, Inuit leaders want the report to include both science and native knowledge. For example, a scientist researching salmon might look at the salmon population first. An Inuit would taste the water, look at vegetation, check fish scales and check the feel of the meat. \"You're asking two different questions but both of them are really needed,\" Behe says.\n\n## Many Government Agencies Are Involved\n\nThe report also points out that land, ocean and wildlife laws are created by different government agencies. State lawmakers set hunting seasons, which may correspond to the best time to process fish and meat to then sell it. Federal lawmakers oversee hunting of marine mammals and larger commercial ocean fishing. In addition, officials have to work with other countries to make decisions about salmon and migratory birds. \n\nThe United States and other countries all contribute to global warming and pollution that affects the Arctic. Behe says, \"The people causing the pollution have to have more responsibility and have to be expected to change their behavior, as opposed to expecting the Inuit to change theirs.\"\n\nFran Ulmer is head of the United States Arctic Research Commission, a government agency that oversees U.S. policy for the Arctic. She says food security is a top goal. Researchers want to better understand how rapid climate change in the Arctic is affecting the environment and the people who live there. Ulmer says the problem is also important to the Arctic Council, a gathering of Arctic countries.'"

            "title": "Everyone knows students learn more in smaller classes, or do they?",
            "text": "\tIt seems obvious that giving teachers fewer students to teach is a change that makes sense. Students should get more individual attention and perform better.\n\nThe idea is popular with parents and lawmakers alike. In fact, at least 40 states have cut class sizes in the past 15 years.\n\nBut despite more than four 40 years of research, it has been hard to measure the results of reducing class sizes.\n\nResearchers generally agree that smaller classes are linked to educational benefits, at least for the earlier grades. Among the positives are better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates, especially for poorer children.\n\n## Who Benefits Most?\n\nThey disagree, however, on whether those benefits outweigh the costs. Lowering class sizes means hiring more teachers, which many states feel they can't afford right now.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have been trying to figure out why smaller class size works and who benefits most.\n\nThe answers would help show what else can be done besides just shrinking classes to get the best results for the money.\n\nThe studies were based on classroom observations and interviews. They have revealed some surprising information.\n\nThe most persuasive class-size research in the United States comes from a large experiment in Tennessee. Students in small classes there outperformed students in larger groups.\n\n## A Tale Of Two States\n\nProject STAR was conducted in Tennessee from 1985 to 1989. The study involved more than 1,200 teachers and almost 12,000 students, according to Jeremy Finn, a professor at the University of Buffalo who helped set up the experiment.\n\nThe Tennessee results inspired California and Wisconsin to cut class sizes statewide in lower grades in 1996. Back then state governments had extra money to hire teachers.\n\nWisconsin's smaller classes benefited students. California seemed not to as much. Some people said California hired inexperienced teachers and didn't have enough space for the smaller classes. The different results showed that simply making classes smaller is not enough.\n\nIn 2003, Finn wrote a paper that identified a big hole in the puzzle. It said that many studies show positive effects. Still, research has yet to show a specific reason that makes small classes work.\n\n## I Saw That!\n\nPeople thought that teachers gave students more individualized instruction in smaller classrooms. However, observers did not actually see this happen.\n\nSeveral studies have found that teachers teach the same way they always have, even with smaller class sizes.\n\nFinn and his coworkers proposed a different explanation: Students behave better and get more involved when they can't hide in the back of the classroom.\n\nHe saw the change himself visiting classrooms in Buffalo.\n\n\"In a big class, everybody in the back of the room is talking and giggling, and the little kids are throwing things at each other,\" Finn said. \"But in a small class, the first thing a teacher says is 'Let's all bring our chairs around me here in a circle.'\"\n\nSmaller, quieter classes (fewer than 20 students) may have their biggest effect on kids who are inattentive and try to avoid looking the teacher in the eye. The reason is they can't hide.\n\n## Making It Work\n\nFinn compared the performance of fourth-graders considered to be disruptive, inattentive or neither. He used information from Project STAR to do this.\n\n\"Most people I talk to predict that the disruptive kids are the worst, but they're not. The inattentive, withdrawn kids are by far and away poorer students than all the others,\" Finn said.\n\nBut wouldn't smaller class sizes work even better if teachers and principals changed what they're doing, too?\n\nThat's the question Elizabeth Graue and her coworkers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been studying at schools involved in a project called SAGE.\n\nThe SAGE program began in 1996 and has studied almost 500 schools around the state.\n\nGraue and her team found big differences among the schools.\n\n## Better Training, More Space\n\nFor example, sometimes schools would put two experienced teachers in the same room, which lowered the class size on paper.\n\nBut in practice, one teacher might be doing paperwork while the other was teaching all the kids. Then the class size had really gone up for those kids.\n\nSmall classes also did not work as well if teachers lacked enough physical space to teach in.\n\n\"We saw classes that were in former locker rooms,\" Graue said. \"I don't know how many classrooms I saw where they used a row of bookcases as a wall ... and anytime the other class did anything noisy, everything ground to a halt in the class next door.\"\n\nSmaller classes worked best when teachers were trained in how to better tailor instruction to each student's needs and spent more time getting to know their students' families.\n\n\"Class-size reduction alone will only get fewer children in a class,\" Graue said. \"It doesn't translate directly to a change in achievement.\"'"

            "text": "\tPUEBLA, Mexico - A straight-talking Mexican nun has become an unlikely television star.\n\nFlorinda Ruiz Carapia, better known as Hermana Flor, is one of five finalists on Mexico's version of \"Master Chef.\" On the show, contestants compete for a 1 million peso prize, which equals $59,000. She very much wants to win to help her order, the Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ. It owes 7 million pesos for loans it took out to build schools, according to Alejandro Esquivel, the producer of the show.\n\nJose Antonio Barrientos, a missionary in the order, confirmed the debt problems. A missionary travels to other countries to help poor people and promote Christianity. He said Hermana Flor's order is also worried that new government rules might require expensive renovations to its schools.\n\n## Manuevering Down To Final Five\n\nHermana Flor, 68, has already made it past several stages. The 300 wannabe chefs have been narrowed down to five finalists. With only three weeks left till the show's end, Hermana Flor has proven so popular that Esquivel is a little worried about problems if the nun does not win. A panel of professional chefs judges the contestants on the taste, presentation and speed of their dishes.\n\n\"I think Hermana Flor's popularity comes from her being a very straightforward, very human, very sympathetic person,\" Esquivel said.\n\nIt's not all sugar and sweetness from Hermana Flor. In fact it is her tasty, fiery chile sauces that have gotten her this far.\n\nHermana Flor cooks three meals a day for 150 students who are studying to be priests. She runs a simple but healthy operation. A small mill grinds heaps of corn for fresh tortillas, sheep graze outside the windows, and pigs and chickens eat the kitchen scraps. Leftovers are given to local hospitals.\n\n## Show Not Anything Like Her Daily Kitchen\n\nBut it leaves Hermana Flor struggling with things like arranging food on plates and presentation. She deesn't worry about how her food looks when hungry would-be priests pile into the dining hall. She sets out a plate full of food for each table of 10, and everybody serves himself.\n\nShe also was baffled when the judges at \"Master Chef\" made her cook a lobster. \"There are a lot of things I don't know how to use, like the lobster,\" she said. \"That's a kind of seafood I've never cooked here. We don't have the money for that kind of thing.\"\n\nShe also was a bit scared of cooking thick pieces of meat.\n\n\"I did a chop (on the show), and it came out raw, because it was so thick. I ruined it,\" said the sister, who is just under 5 feet tall. \"Look at this,\" she said, pointing to a metal bowl of thin-cut flank steaks in the seminary's kitchen. \"The steaks we have here are paper-thin; you put them on the grill and they're done. We don't have any medium, medium-rare, none of that here.\"\n\n## Cooking The Best Of Fresh, Local And Classic Ingredients\n\nHermana Flor uses classic, local ingredients that do not cost much and pack a spicy punch. On a recent day, she was cooking beef, grilled nopal cactus, grilled onions, rice, beans and tortillas.\n\n\"There is always chile in Mexico, and lots of it, and tomatoes and onions,\" she said, adding, \"With that, I can make you a tasty dish.\"\n\nThe three judges on the show agree and praise Hermana Flor's sauces. She has earned more than 31,000 followers on her Twitter account in the 15 weeks since the show began. Fans crowd her Facebook page with comments like, \"You're an inspiration!\" and \"She's Mexico's favorite nun.\"\n\nBut just do not try to congratulate Hermana Flor yet.\n\n\"Don't tell me I'm famous. I'm not famous until I get that money in my hand,\" she said. \"I want to win, because I want to help others. I still have five (contestants) to go, and fame hasn't done anything for me yet. It hasn't given me 1 cent.\"\n\n## Keeping An Eye On That $59,000 Prize\n\nKeeping an eye over the helpers in her giant kitchen, Hermana Flor noted, \"There's never enough money in the religious orders. Money is never wasted.\"\n\nShe said she dreams of helping her order get out of debt and of funding missions to help poor people in Africa or Mexico.\n\n\"We have debts, we have missions where we provide aid, and so with this contest, and the million pesos they offer ... I am going to be able to help,\" she said in a friendly but determined way.\n\nShe would also like to attract women to her religious order. The nuns are growing older, and the order is dying out.\n\n\"I'd like to invite the girls who are watching me (on television) and want to be like me to come to the convent, so the order can grow,\" she said, \"and so there can be many, many Hermanas Flor.\"'"

            "text": "\tKAVOUSI, Greece - In June, high on a hill overlooking Mirabello Bay, the digging once again resumed. Slowly but surely, an ancient city lost for thousands of years is being uncovered.\n\nArchaeologists and students from the U.S. were using shovels and picks in their quest to understand the mysteries of Azoria. The ancient city in Crete was destroyed by fire about 2,500 years ago. Crete is an island off Greece in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nFragments of writing have been found on pottery at the site, but the language of Azoria has yet to be figured out. So clues must be gathered from the things people left behind: buildings, personal items, tools and food.\n\nThe project is the life's work of its director, archaeologist Donald Haggis.\n\nDigging is only allowed for six weeks per year, but Haggis has been at it since 2002. Considerable work has already been done.\n\n## Where European Civilization Started\n\nToday on the hilltop, there are a couple of dozen students, archaeologists and Greek workers. They are busy digging around different building foundations.\n\n\"It's fun whacking away,\" joked Duke University student Chelsea Bright, who plans to become an archaeologist. \"It's like you're a lumberjack.\"\n\nThe hilltop is a series of excavated houses and unearthed public buildings. Foundations, lower walls and sometimes benches have been discovered. Haggis serves as a foreman, directing the crew of dozens of students and Greek workers - most of them local Cretan farmers - in their digging.\n\nCrete is a magnet for archaeologists. The island, near the Greek mainland, is where European civilization started with the Minoan culture from 2700 to 1450 B.C.\n\nIn 1900, the American archaeologist Harriet Boyd Hawes discovered the site of Azoria as part of her exploration of the area. However, she did almost no digging, and the site remained unexplored for the next century.\n\nIn 1988, Haggis decided that Azoria might be worth a closer look.\n\n## Pottery Pointed The Way\n\nHaggis and fellow researcher Margaret Mook were convinced from pottery they found that the site was much older than initially thought. They concluded that Azoria would be a worthwhile site to study.\n\n\"This just thrilled us,\" Haggis said when they found the old pots. \"Always in the back of my mind I was to dig there.\"\n\nAzoria was a small city, with an estimated population of 2,000 to 5,000 people. It developed following the great Minoan civilization.\n\nThere had been settlements on the mountaintop of Azoria for centuries, but a full-blown city did not develop until around 630 B.C. But around 480 B.C., it was destroyed by a catastrophic fire, probably as a result of being attacked by invading forces. Eventually, it became lost in time. Today, it offers a time capsule of what a Cretan city looked like during the Archaic Period of 900 to 500 B.C.\n\nBecause no one has been able to decode the language of the Cretans of this period, much of their history is a blank slate: It can only be interpreted from what is dug up from the ground.\n\nSo far, the dig has uncovered a town with a rich public life. Among the discoveries was a building that was likely the location of shared public meals. The building includes dining rooms and kitchens, and storerooms that had what was left of ancient grapes, olives and grains.\n\n## A First For The Site\n\nThe dig also uncovered what is called the Monumental Civic Building. Primarily a large hall, this building has a stepped bench built into its walls and an adjoining two-room shrine.\n\nIt is the first time, said Haggis, that two large public buildings of the period have been unearthed. They suggest that many of the men ate together - perhaps because all were soldiers.\n\nWhatever is found at the site is taken to a nearby institute, where research is conducted and the shards are painstakingly reconstructed into complete pots.\n\nEach year, American students - most of them future archaeologists - do field work at Azoria. This summer, 42 of them are working on the project.\n\nThe students are drawn to archaeology for different reasons. For Emma Buckingham, the reasons include a love of all things Greek and Roman, and \"the joy of discovery.\" For Tim Shea, it's a matter of putting the Greek and Latin he learned at a Jesuit high school to good use. An inspiring high school teacher influenced Julie Juhasz.\n\n## Hard Work Under A Hot Sun\n\nDespite the postcard setting, the students are doing physically demanding, dusty work under the broiling sun.\n\nThe students start work at 7 a.m. and finish by midafternoon, when the sun becomes unbearable. However, the more senior students, known as trench masters, work late into the afternoon to carefully record the day's findings.\n\nMost students find the work both intellectually and physically challenging - but some take to the hard work.\n\n\"I love the history and the experience,\" said Juhasz, \"and there is something satisfying about swinging a huge pick.\"\n\nFor those working at the site, there is the romance of uncovering the past, as Juhasz found out when she discovered a pot.\n\n\"It's like a connection with someone who died 3,000 years ago,\" Juhasz said.'"

            "text": "\tORLANDO, Fla. - Curtis Doyle is excited about visiting Walt Disney World next summer. He reminds his dad about the trip every day, sometimes more than once.\n\nBut the trip is causing his father, Brad, anxiety. Curtis is 27 years old and has autism, a brain disorder. And he will be affected by a new change in policy at the theme park. Disney recently said it would stop allowing disabled guests to jump ahead in lines at its attractions. Disney will give them return times instead.\n\nIt might seem a minor change to most families. But it's not to Brad, whose son, like many people with intellectual disabilities, has a habit of becoming attached to certain things. He becomes frustrated when he cannot have or do them. Sometimes he melts down in outbursts and bites his own hands.\n\nAcross the country, parents of children with disabilities are alarmed at the news that Disney will soon end its \"guest assistance card\" program. Some have launched online petitions and letter-writing campaigns.\n\n## Faking Handicaps To Jump The Line\n\nSome parents say waiting for a long time is not practical for their children. Some cannot mentally process why they can't ride immediately. Others must be on rigid schedules for food, medicine or even bathroom breaks. Some can be in the parks for only two or three hours before their child becomes exhausted or has a meltdown.\n\n\"This is going to be a huge obstacle for my son,\" said Brad, 49, of Glendale, Ariz. He has taken Curtis to Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif, many times. \"I really have to rethink my whole vacation now.\"\n\nDisney says it is sympathetic to their concerns. But it also says it must make changes to the program. Right now the guest assistance cards are being widely exploited by others.\n\nStories of wealthy families hiring disabled tour guides to pose as family members have drawn national attention and scorn. But the more common abuse is subtler. People are faking handicaps that can be hard to check, such as heart murmurs, back pain or claustrophobia. Groups have been caught using a pass issued to an elderly relative to jump the lines for rides that the relative can't go on.\n\nThe abuse has gotten worse in recent years. Disney's theme parks draw tens of millions of visitors a year, and the swelling crowds have fed abuse. Last year, Disney California Adventure opened Cars Land, based on the movie Cars.\n\nSoon after, Disney found that close to a quarter of all the visitors riding Radiator Springs Racers in Cars Land were using a guest assistance card. That meant 5,000 visitors out of 20,000 each day, according to MiceChat.com, a website devoted to Disney theme-park news. Most were also annual pass holders.\n\n## Card Program Was \"Abused And Exploited\"\n\nDisney won't provide exact figures. But it says that it now gets hundreds of thousands of requests annually for guest assistance cards. It admits that the number of people asking for them has grown \"substantially\" during the past few years.\n\nDisney says it remains committed to making disabled visitors welcome in its parks.\n\n\"Unfortunately, our current program has been abused and exploited to such an extent that we are no longer able to effectively sustain it,\" Meg Crofton said in a statement. She's president of Disney's theme-park operations in the U.S. and France. Disney released the statement Friday in an open letter to organizations that help disabled people.\n\n\"We have long recognized that people may have different needs, and we will continue to work individually with our Guests with disabilities to provide assistance that is responsive to their unique circumstances,\" she wrote\n\nDisney is widely seen as among the most friendly companies in the world for disabled visitors. Its guest assistance cards are a big reason why. They don't completely get rid of waiting. But they generally permit disabled guests and their parties to immediately enter the FastPass line at an attraction or use a separate entrance.\n\n\"The big thing to me was, with kids with special needs, it's just extremely difficult to go and take a vacation,\" said Chuck Baugh, 48, of Boca Raton. He has two sons. His family does not like stopping at public restrooms because his children have conditions that affect their immune systems.\n\n## Return Times Start Oct. 9\n\nBoth Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando generally require disabled visitors to return to rides at certain times. Disney will begin using that same model Oct. 9.\n\nUnder Disney's new system, guests will be issued access cards. When they show those cards to employees at ride entrances they will be given a time to return. The length of the current standby line will determine the return time. The new cards will also include the visitor's photo and will be good for seven days. They were good for 14 days under the old system.\n\n\"For some families, that's going to be perfectly fine and acceptable. But I think there are some where it's going to limit their ability to go,\" said Christie Ebeltoft-Bancalari. She is an Orlando mother of a child who has a genetic condition called Down syndrome.\n\nParents say there must be a better solution. Some suggest making families apply for the cards before they arrive in the parks. Others say Disney could allow parents to collect return times for several attractions at once, though doing so might invite more abuse.\n\n\"There has to be some sort of middle ground,\" said Don La Vette of Joliet, Ill. She has an 11-year-old son with autism and language and coordination problems. \"Goodness gracious, you can't hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating.\"'"

            "text": "\tSHANGHAI, China - Chef-turned-food writer Christopher St. Cavish is striding toward the front door of the Welcome Revered Guests restaurant when he stops dead in his tracks. \"They don't like me here,\" he says, frowning.\n\nIt's not that he has criticized the eatery. In fact, he gave it his highest rating. Rather, what has annoyed the staff here is the way St. Cavish judges the quintessential Shanghai snack: soup dumplings known as xiao long bao (pronounced SHOW-long-BAO). The dumplings have just a thin layer of dough, with hot soup and a meatball inside.\n\nOn his last visit to the restaurant, he ordered nine baskets of the handmade dumplings. Then, he spent the next hour studying them like a lab technician. His equipment included an electronic scale, digital calipers (to measure thickness) and special scissors.\n\nAfter all his calculations, he ate only two dumplings. The other 52 went into a takeout box.\n\n## Making An Annoying (To Some) Study Of It\n\nWith his scientific tools in hand, St. Cavish has visited dozens of restaurants to study xiao long bao. He has probed the thinness of the dough, the volume of the soup and the weight of hundreds upon hundreds of pork meatballs. He has studied how the structure of xiao long bao changes when it leaves the steamer and starts to cool.\n\nThe numbers have been crunched into what just may be the nerdiest restaurant guide ever, the Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index. Welcome Revered Guests restaurant, or Zun Ke Lai in Mandarin, came in first place.\n\nFoodies all over the world have become obsessed with xiao long bao, which are eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even to satisfy the midnight munchies. The Shanghai government has listed them as one of 84 \"protected traditional treasures\" of the city.\n\nSt. Cavish is a 34-year-old from Florida who worked as a chef for 10 years before coming to China. He is perhaps more qualified than most to declare that the dumplings at Zun Ke Lai are superior. Since late 2013, he has visited 52 sellers of xiao long bao in an effort to find the best.\n\nSome of the staff at Zun Ke Lai, though, have been more irritated than thrilled by St. Cavish's attention.\n\n\"They were (angry),\" St. Cavish recalls, glancing through the front window to see whether the woman who had to hand-make his infuriating 54-dumpling order is behind the counter today. \"When I later told her Zun Ke Lai came out on top of my index, she was totally unimpressed. She looked at me as if I had just told her I had a toenail problem,\" he said.\n\n## The Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index\n\nStill, the Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index has made St. Cavish rather famous in China.\n\nNews outlets across the country have reported on the index, which St. Cavish has published in the form of a scientific-looking foldable chart (cost: $8). The brochure is funny and technical at the same time.\n\nBefore coming to China, St. Cavish said, he didn't have a background in science and had never even eaten xiao long bao. Even today, he says they're not his favorite dish, and he doesn't cook them at home.\n\n\"I'm not obsessed with them,\" he says, pushing his thick black-framed glasses up the bridge of his nose. \"But they happen to be a vehicle for lots of other ideas I have about food and food writing.\"\n\nSt. Cavish says part of his motivation was to find a new way to talk about food.\n\n\"All my previous writing about food was very subjective,\" he says. \"It was liberating to go to a restaurant and not think: Do I like this or not like it, why or why not?\"\n\n## Think More Deeply, Talk More Precisely\n\nXiao long bao proved to be a good subject for St. Cavish's experiment. That's because the things that go into making a great soup dumpling can be easily measured.\n\nSt. Cavish admits that on one hand, the index is a \"ridiculous project.\"\n\n\"It's a funny experiment; I don't want people to take it too seriously,\" he says, sitting in a booth at Zun Ke Lai, his measuring equipment and three baskets of dumplings in front of him. \"I'm not implying that people should only cook by scales or measurements ... of course the human factor is very important.\"\n\nYet at the same time, he says the index gives restaurant-goers - and himself - a way to think more deeply and talk more precisely about what makes a food satisfying or even delicious.\n\n\"As a food writer, your responsibility is to explain why you like or don't like something,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tDALLAS - Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to develop symptoms of the Ebola virus in the United States, died Wednesday at a hospital in Dallas. His death was announced by hospital officials.\n\nDuncan, 42, had been in the hospital for more than a week. He was in critical condition, the most serious medical status a patient can have. He had been breathing with the help of a respirator machine. His kidneys were no longer working on their own.\n\nHe was receiving a drug called brincidofovir. The drug is an experimental medicine that has not yet been proven effective. Normally, drugs must be approved for use based on years of testing. An exception has been made in the case of the Ebola virus because it is a rare disease.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan this morning at 7:51 a.m.,\" Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said in a statement.\n\n## \"We Offer Prayers Of Comfort\"\n\nDuncan had first gone to the hospital on Sept. 25 with a fever, stomach pains and a headache. He told the hospital that he had been in Africa but was given antibiotics and sent home. Antibiotics do not work to treat viruses, only bacterial infections. After his condition worsened, he returned by ambulance on Sept. 28 and was placed in an isolated room where he would only have contact with his medical caregivers.\n\nDuncan, the hospital said, \"fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing.\"\n\nJudge Clay Jenkins, the top elected official in Dallas County, also expressed his grief.\n\n\"My thoughts are with the family and friends of Thomas Eric Duncan at this time, especially his fiancee Louise, their son Karsiah and all those who loved him. We are also thinking of the dedicated hospital staff who assisted Mr. Duncan daily while he fought this terrible disease,\" he said.\n\n\"We offer prayers of comfort and peace to everyone impacted by his passing,\" he said.\n\n## Nurse In Spain Caught Ebola\n\nDuncan had left the West African country of Liberia on Sept. 19 and arrived in Dallas to visit his fiancee on Sept. 20. Health officials have said that no one on the plane with him is in danger because Duncan had no symptoms until after arriving in the U.S.\n\nEbola is a deadly virus. During the latest outbreak in West Africa, it has killed about 70 percent of those who contracted it. The disease is transmitted by contact with its victims' bodily fluids - such as vomit, blood or saliva. More than 3,400 people have died of Ebola in West Africa during the current outbreak - the worst on record.\n\nEbola patients can only pass on the disease to others once the patient shows symptoms. Typical symptoms include fever, bad headaches, muscle pain, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nThe disease was first identified in Guinea in March. It has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nIn addition, a nurse in Spain caught the virus in the hospital where she works. She had treated two people who were exposed to Ebola doing religious missionary work in Africa. Those two had been sent back to Spain for medical care. The nurse has been isolated in a hospital unit. She is the first person known to have caught Ebola without going to Africa.'"

            "text": "\tDALLAS - A nurse who took care of an Ebola patient is the first person in the United States to get the deadly disease.\n\nThe woman discovered she had a fever Friday night and drove herself to the emergency room of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. She was placed in isolation 90 minutes later. A blood sample sent to the state health lab in Austin confirmed Saturday night that she had Ebola.\n\nThe woman had helped care for Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last Wednesday. He brought the deadly disease with him from Liberia, Africa, when he came to visit relatives in Dallas.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said Sunday that the nurse caught Ebola because of a \"breach in protocol.\" The word protocol refers to the rules that health care workers must follow when they come into contact with Ebola patients.\n\n## Exposure To Ebola\n\nHealth care workers are required to wear protective gear, including gloves, masks and special clothing. The CDC was keeping watch on people who had contact with Duncan. The nurse, however, was not on its list.\n\nFrieden said CDC officials have spoken with the nurse. She was not sure how she may have caught Ebola.\n\nFrieden said exposure to the Ebola virus can come from a single accidental slip-up. \"Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola\" in health care workers, he said.\n\nTexas Health Commissioner David Lakey said the nurse had \"extensive contact\" with Duncan. The nurse missed two days of work before going to the emergency room Friday night. Officials think she came into contact with only one person since she began feeling sick.\n\nEbola is spread through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a sick person. It can only be transmitted after an infected person begins showing symptoms.\n\n\"We have been preparing for an event like this,\" Lakey said.\n\n## Nurse's Apartment And Car Cleaned\n\nPresbyterian Hospital official Daniel Varga said the nurse contracted Ebola during Duncan's second visit to the hospital. Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola in the United States, went to Presbyterian's emergency room Sept. 26. He was sent home with medicine and returned to the hospital two days later, on Sept. 28. Duncan tested positive with Ebola. He died Oct. 8.\n\nOfficials are not saying who the nurse is or how she helped take care of Duncan.\n\nThe nurse's apartment was cleaned and sterilized Sunday. While the CDC didn't consider her to be at \"high risk\" of contracting Ebola, she had been taking her temperature twice a day and checking herself for other signs of the disease.\n\nSymptoms of Ebola include fever, headaches and stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Ebola is fatal in 50 percent to 80 percent of people who get it. Although there are experimental treatments, there is no proven vaccine or cure yet.\n\nA team also thoroughly cleaned the nurse's car and the common area of her apartment building on Sunday.\n\n## \"It's Really Puzzling\"\n\nPolice officers and a CDC official talked to apartment residents on Sunday morning and gave out information about Ebola symptoms. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings also visited them.\n\n\"It just breaks my heart. She was just an innocent woman who took care of someone who was sick,\" said neighbor Colleen Watson said.\n\nLindsey Carpenter, 33, said her roommate had searched on the Internet to find out why news helicopters were flying over their neighborhood. The roommate barged into her room at 9:30 a.m. when he found an answer. \"There's an Ebola patient in the neighborhood,\" he said.\n\nCarpenter, who works in a nearby hospital, said she hopes Presbyterian Hospital investigates how the nurse got Ebola. The nurse was exposed to Duncan during his second visit to the hospital and the health care workers were wearing protective gear.\n\n\"I wonder how she got it,\" Carpenter said. \"It's really puzzling. There's probably more to the story that we don't know.\"'"

            "text": "\tDALLAS, Texas - A man who traveled from Liberia to visit family members in Texas tested positive for Ebola on Tuesday. The unidentified patient is the first confirmed case outside of Africa, health officials said.\n\nThe man is extremely ill. He has been cared for in a special isolation ward at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas since Sunday, said Dr. Edward Goodman, a hospital official. The patient first sought treatment in the hospital's emergency room Friday and was sent home with antibiotics, Goodman said.\n\n\"I have no doubt that we will control this importation of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"We will stop it here.\"\n\nFrieden emphasized that the man could not spread the disease until he began to develop active symptoms of the fever. He had been in contact with only a handful of people after he became sick. Medical teams are now scrambling to find them all.\n\n## Africa Battles Worst Ebola Outbreak In History\n\nThe man looked like he was perfectly healthy when he stepped off an airplane Sept. 20 from Liberia. He began to feel sick four days later, Freiden said. Officials would not say which flights the patient took to get to Texas.\n\nLiberia is one of the three African nations now battling the worst Ebola outbreak in history. However, Frieden said other passengers on the airplane would not have been at risk since the patient had no symptoms at the time of the flight.\n\nEbola is part of a group of diseases called viral hemorrhagic fevers. It is a deadly disease that kills between 50 and 80 percent of people who become sick. It is spread through direct contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected person.\n\nEbola's symptoms include fever, headaches and stomach pain, severe vomiting and diarrhea. As the virus grows, its effects on the body grow increasingly severe, and the person might start bleeding and their organs like their lungs and heart could start shutting down. There is no vaccine or cure.\n\nHenry Johnson lives in Dallas. He heard about the Ebola patient while watching TV in the hospital's emergency room. Johnson said that people in the crowded room watched closely and remained calm.\n\n## No Other Ebola Cases In Texas, Official Says\n\nJohnson said he was worried about the people who were in the ER on Friday. He was also concerned about those who might have been exposed to Ebola after the patient was sent home from the hospital.\n\nAccording to Johnson, the hospital should have isolated him on Friday. \"I hope they catch it before it really gets out,\" he said.\n\nA special team of CDC \"disease detectives\" and other experts have been sent to Texas to help Dallas County health workers locate everyone the patient came into contact with. Once they are found, they will be monitored for 21 days. If they show signs of a fever, they will be isolated and tested for Ebola.\n\n\"There are no other suspected cases in the state of Texas at this time,\" said Dr. David Lakey. He is the top official of the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nIn West Africa, at least 6,574 people have become sick with Ebola and at least 3,091 have died, according to the World Health Organization. The spread of the disease since March has been blamed on the failure of the West African nations to quickly recognize the threat and their lack of basic medical supplies and facilities. The response from Western countries has also been slow.\n\n## Good Health Care In U.S. Cited\n\nHealth experts say the situation in the United States is very different. Good health care in the U.S. makes a large outbreak here highly unlikely.\n\n\"We have the ability to trace contacts, monitor people and to act quickly if any of them should start to exhibit symptoms,\" said Dr. Anne Rimoin. She is a doctor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. If the African countries had these systems, \"there wouldn't be this huge outbreak in the first place,\" she said.\n\nThe CDC announced Tuesday that Ebola outbreaks in Senegal and Nigeria were now under control. It gave credit to the quick response of the medical teams.\n\nDallas-area residents, particularly those in the Liberian community, are worried that Ebola has come to their city.\n\nStanley Gaye is the president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth. He said local Liberians were already anxious about being around people who had recently been to West Africa.\n\n\"This disease is a horrible disease, and I don't want to be in a gathering with someone (whose) family has been affected by the disease,\" Gaye said.'"

            "text": "\tBERLIN, Germany - A solemn-faced boy warily gazes about a jam-packed train station. Nearby is a little girl whose hair has not been brushed or combed for days. Just beyond, a group of teens are clustered around someone's smartphone, debating where to go next and how to get there. All of them have no adults in sight.\n\nAid groups and governments call them \"unaccompanied minors.\" These children under 18 are making the dangerous thousand-mile journey across half of Europe without a parent.\n\nThey make up only a small portion of the tens of thousands of migrants and refugees currently crossing Europe. Children are between 4 percent and 7 percent of the total number of refugees, international organizations estimate. Yet, these youngsters pose a special challenge to those who are trying to help victims of war and persecution find safety.\n\nAnd their journeys come at a point when the resources of nations and aid groups are stretched to the breaking point. For them, safe haven is growing harder to find.\n\n## Many Refugees Set Sights On Germany\n\nWealthy Germany is one of the most popular destinations for the migrants. The northern European country had thrown open its doors to asylum seekers for more than a week. However, the country is now stopping some refugees from entering. German officials said this is temporary and suggested that the country expects to take in as many as 1 million migrants this year.\n\nMazen Hassoun is a 16-year-old Syrian boy, who arrived in Berlin this month from the town of Mansurah. Raqqah, which is near his hometown, is the headquarters of the group Islamic State. The extremist group has overrun large parts of Syria and Iraq and has killed many people.\n\n\"My parents believed I had to get out of there before I was forced to fight for Daash,\" he said, using the Arabic acronym for the group. \"We didn't have the money to bring the whole family, so it was decided that I would make the journey.\"\n\nMany of the youngsters are silent and terrified when they arrive. Remarkably quickly, they recover their high spirits - or appear to. On a recent day, a center in Munich, Germany, was filled with lively chatter - some in German, some in the children's native languages, including Pashto, Arabic and Somali.\n\n## Days Of Laughter, Nights Of Terror\n\n\"They become children again,\" said administrator Jutta Stiehler. \"But at night, the ghosts come back.\" The children have frightening memories, and these sometimes haunt them through nightmares and bed-wetting, she said.\n\nRimas is just 9 years old. She sometimes cried for her mother during the long journey from Syria through Greece, Macedonia, Hungary and Austria, her uncle said.\n\nHer uncle said the sound of her nighttime sobs sometimes broke his heart. But there was something he feared even more.\n\n\"The worst were the times when I could tell that the two of them, she and her cousin Mahmoud, they were too frightened even to cry,\" said Abdel Rahman Koweifi. He brought one child belonging to each of his two brothers on the long journey.\n\n## Journeys Filled With Danger And Fear\n\nThey experienced some terrifying moments. Their rubber raft overturned in the sea after setting out from Turkey, but they were close enough to shore that they were rescued.\n\nThe Koweifi family had agreed that sending the two children to travel in their uncle's care might ultimately enable the whole family to come to Europe. The journey cost a total of $4,500 for the three of them, Koweifi said. It's a choice many of those enduring Syria's civil war are making.\n\nAid workers say that youngsters who travel without their parents often feel intense pressure. Some families hope that the children will be able to get work and send back money. Others hope that asylum will lead the way for other family members to join them. In the course of the journey, unprotected youngsters can be attacked or robbed, or worse.\n\nMichael Bochenek is an expert on children's rights with Human Rights Watch in London. \"Desperate people do what they have to do to make these kinds of journeys,\" he said.\n\n## Family Looks Toward A Fresh Start - And Reunion\n\nIn Berlin, Koweifi was happy that he had been allowed to remain with his niece and nephew at a refugee camp. The children are able to call or text their parents at least once a day.\n\nTheir asylum paperwork has begun, though Koweifi expects it will take weeks or months before they know whether they will be allowed to stay in Germany. Of all the national groups currently on the move, Syrians have perhaps the best chance.\n\nHe recalled the tearful goodbyes in Syria, when he swore to his brothers that he would guard their children's lives with his own.\n\n\"I said that if one of them were to die, it would be like my own death, but much, much worse,\" he said. \"I look at them, and it is hard to believe we are safe, and perhaps we will all be together again - maybe not so soon, but someday.\"'"

            "text": "\tKANSAS CITY, Mo. - Tessa, 8, and Isaac, 6, didn't want to leave Missouri's Weston Bend State Park. The Minters were barely out of the park when the kids began begging for a return trip.\n\nThey'd spent the day catching bugs and on scavenger hunts as part of Missouri State Parks' Learn2 Camp program. It wasn't enough, though, for nature's newest fans. They wanted another night to roast marshmallows and sing \"I've Been Workin' On The Railroad\" around a campfire - and soon.\n\nThat's exactly what Missouri State Parks wants to hear.\n\nCamping permit sales in Missouri's parks dropped 13 percent between 2000 and 2013, the most recent year for which camping numbers were available. National parks have been dealing with a decline in overnight stays since the 1980s. Nowadays, visitors seem to prefer the comfort of nearby motels.\n\n## Tents, Campfires And Animal Tracks\n\nThe Learn2 Camp program works to ease families who haven't camped before into the outdoors. The program brings them out to a park for a weekend and provides equipment and organized activities, said Stephanie Deidrick. She is a spokeswoman for Missouri State Parks.\n\nThey were shown things like how to pitch a tent or how to cook over a campfire. Deidrick said she hopes it will make it so that \"families will be more likely to camp on their own in the future.\"\n\nDeidrick said that getting kids into camping early can increase the chances they'll camp as adults.\n\nThe program was exactly what Kelly Minter had hoped for when she applied.\n\nShe and her husband Ron already had agreed to their kids' longtime pleas for a camping trip. They had set one up to Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park for the end of June.\n\nKelly Minter had camped with her family as a child. However, she said she preferred taking her own kids to Oceans of Fun, a theme park in Kansas City. It was less work than preparing a campsite.\n\nAfter the camping trip was planned, she was worried. What if her ideas and her husband's various \"theories\" about how to start a fire or set up a tent wouldn't match real life?\n\nThis year's Learn2 Camp at Weston Bend was the perfect test run.\n\nWith the help of park employees, Ron Minter figured out how to put up a large six-person tent. Isaac and Tessa learned how to identify various trees, insects and animal tracks. Ron Minter got instructions on using sticks to start a campfire. No more lighter fluid and starter logs for him, his wife hopes.\n\n\"I think we might be camping more,\" Kelly Minter said.\n\n## Drop In Overnight Camping Trips\n\nAccording to the Outdoor Foundation's most recent \"American Camper Report,\" 40.1 million Americans went camping in 2013 - a drop of about 424,000 from 2012 and a decline of 6.1 million from 2009.\n\nNational parks hosted nearly 11.9 million overnight visits in 1981, according to the National Park Service. That number had shrunk to 8.8 million by 2000, a 26 percent difference.\n\nNational Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson said the way Americans experience parks changed in the last 30 years. Attendance numbers reached an all-time high last year, but people are not spending the night as often.\n\nVisitors now have more overnight options, including staying in nearby towns.\n\n\"They have a lot more in the way of services for visitors, like motel rooms and seats in restaurants. Some people love to spend the night near national parks and then get up and go after breakfast in the morning,\" Olson said.\n\nFamous parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite are still full every weekend and require making reservations well in advance, Olson said. Camping numbers, however, may never get back to the highs of the 1980s.\n\nThe decline in camping may be more tied to Americans spending less time away from work than any lack of equipment and training.\n\nIn the 2014 \"American Camper\" survey, 71 percent of people gave \"more free time or vacation time\" as a reason that they would continue camping.\n\n## Creating \"A Legacy\" Of Camping\n\nBut the Learn2 Camp program does try to take advantage of one promising fact.\n\nAmong campers asked in the 2013 survey, 85 percent took their first trip before they turned 16. After that key age, any chance of a person going camping decreases quite a bit.\n\nMissouri State Parks knows this well.\n\nExposing families with children to camping when they're younger can start an outdoor tradition for them that may continue for generations, Deidrick said.\n\nChi Kim, who came to Weston Bend with her husband and three children, agreed. She grew up camping in Colorado.\n\n\"I think you are passing on a legacy by coming out here and getting them into camping and the outdoors. Just like anything else, you've got to expose them to it and teach them about it,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - If you wonder how fattening that supersized soft drink is, in about a year you will find out.\n\nSince 1990, food manufacturers have been required to label their products with calorie information. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Tuesday that many places that sell food will have to list calories on their products as well. A calorie is a unit of energy in food. Too many calories lead to weight gain.\n\nThe government is concerned about the great number of overweight Americans. The idea behind the new rule is that if people really knew how many calories were in that slice of pizza or box of popcorn, they would eat more healthy foods.\n\n## Even At Ice Cream Shops\n\nIncluded in the new rules are large chain restaurants, amusement parks and movie theaters. Even supermarkets and convenience stores that serve prepared dishes must say how many calories they contain.\n\nThe new guidelines will apply to chains with more than 20 locations. That also goes for bakeries and cafeterias, as well as ice cream shops, candy stores and pizza parlors.\n\nIf people want additional nutritional information, the new rules say it must be given upon request. The additional information would include things like salt, sugar, fat and cholesterol content.\n\nAlcoholic drinks listed on menus also must be labeled under the FDA rules.\n\n## So Many Details To The Rules\n\nThe new guidelines were required under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which expanded health care coverage in the United States. They begin on Dec. 1, 2015.\n\nVending machine operators will also have to label the calories of each candy bar or bag of chips. The vending machine rules take effect a year later, on Dec. 1, 2016.\n\nThe new rules were detailed on Tuesday in the Federal Register, which publishes government documents. It took 525 pages to explain all the details.\n\nThe rules are intended to help consumers make more informed and healthy nutritional choices.\n\nAmericans spend nearly half their food money on food made outside the home. These outside foods account for about one-third of the calories people eat, according to the FDA. Two-thirds of adults and one-third of children are either overweight or obese. Many people simply do not know how many calories these foods contain. Other people think they have fewer calories than they actually do.\n\n## Making Healthier Choices\n\nPublic health experts praised the new labeling rules. They called the rules an important step toward empowering consumers and creating a healthier nation.\n\n\"These regulations are an achievement for public health,\" said Georges Benjamin. He is the executive director of the American Public Health Association. Benjamin also called them \"a positive step\" toward fighting many diseases tied to being overweight, like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\"Consumers will have the information they need to make healthier, more educated decisions about their food choices when eating outside the home,\" he said.\n\nDawn Sweeney is the president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association. She said the new rules will make nutrition information available in 200,000 restaurants nationwide.\n\n\"We believe that the Food and Drug Administration has positively addressed the areas of greatest concern with the proposed regulations,\" Sweeney wrote.\n\n## The Rules Got Tougher\n\nIn 1990, the federal Nutrition Labeling and Education Act required nutrition information be provided on most foods. However, restaurants, vending machines and other prepared foods were exempt from the law. In the years since, state and local governments created their own labeling requirements. But those were not consistent. The new FDA rules will help avoid situations in which a chain restaurant has to meet different labeling requirements in different states, the FDA wrote.\n\nBut some observers felt the new measures were tougher than expected.

He said it would be extremely expensive for grocery store owners to follow.

            "title": "New rules by FDA aim to eliminate trans fats",
            "text": "\tCHICAGO - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took a step Thursday to eliminate an unhealthy ingredient from Americans' diets. The government agency is making a rule against trans fat.\n\nTrans fat is an artificial substance that clogs the arteries. It was found in a lot of processed foods, or foods made in factories. Food makers and restaurant chains have taken steps to remove trans fats over the past decade. As people learned more about the risks of trans fat over that time, they also have bought healthier alternatives.\n\nThe FDA has required that nutritional labels break out trans fat content since 2006. The rule caused many companies to change their recipes.\n\nThe FDA noted that trans fats in processed food have been shown to raise \"bad\" cholesterol. That can raise the risk of heart disease. Reducing the use of trans fats could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease a year, the FDA said.\n\n## Partially Hydrogenated Oils\n\nThe amount of trans fat people eat is still a big concern, Food and Drug Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said.\n\nTrans fatty acids, or trans fats, are formed when food makers turn liquid oils into solid fats by adding hydrogen atoms. The process is called hydrogenation.\n\nTrans fats are added to some foods. The FDA now has declared that partially hydrogenated oils are not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Partially hydrogenated oils are the main source of trans fats.\n\nThe new guidelines mean that companies that want to use the ingredient have to first get the FDA's approval. Companies also could not claim their food contains \"zero grams trans fat\" if the product has a half-gram or less per serving. For now, food companies can still make that claim.\n\nNutritionists say it's a victory that will take a dangerous substance out of the American diet.\n\nTrans fats are used mostly to make foods feel a certain way or to last longer on the shelf. They preserve flavor, make crusts flaky and keep peanut butter from separating.\n\nThe fats were used more often as Americans ate more processed foods starting in the 1950s. But studies began to question the impact of trans fats on health in the 1990s.\n\n## Sharp Drop In Trans Fats\n\nThe FDA will get responses from the food industry and other experts over the next 60 days.\n\nAmericans have eaten almost 80 percent less trans fat in the last decade. More education about their risks have helped, and so have some local bans against trans fats. Food makers and restaurants also have voluntarily eliminated the ingredient.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to make restaurants stop cooking with trans fats in 2008.\n\n\"Getting rid of artificial trans fat is one of the most important life-saving measures the FDA could take,\" said Michael F. Jacobson. He runs the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nNutrition experts say that many people do not know how much actual trans fat is in foods. Smaller serving sizes can sometimes make people think that the true fat content is less than it seems.\n\n\"If the serving size is small and you eat several servings, the amount of trans fats adds up,\" said Jennifer Ventrelle. She is a dietitian at Rush University Medical Center.\n\nAlso, trans fats most often are in products without food labels. Scones at your local coffee shop or restaurant French fries are a few examples, Ventrelle said.\n\n\"It's how they prepare the food that's important,\" she said.\n\n## Trans Fat In Some Baked Goods On Menus\n\nHow people prepare foods at home matters, too. For instance, the nutrition label on a box of Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese lists zero grams trans fat per serving. But the label also says that adding margarine and 2 percent milk adds trans fat.\n\nKraft declined comment.\n\nMondelez International makes Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins and other cookies and crackers. It said all of its cookies and crackers are labeled as \"zero grams trans fat\" per serving. But some Mondelez products still contain partially hydrogenated oil, according to the label.\n\nGeneral Mills said that it has taken the trans fat out almost all of its U.S. products. It pledged on Thursday to eliminate the rest in response to the FDA's proposed rules. General Mills produces food under different brands including Betty Crocker and Pillsbury.\n\nMost major restaurant companies eliminated partially hydrogenated oils in the mid- to late-2000s, the Center for Science in the Public Interest said. But a number of chains still have menu items that contain some partially hydrogenated oil. The oils are in baked goods.\n\nMcDonald's uses cooking oil that contains zero grams of trans fat per serving. But the USDA notes that some of its products contain trans fats. Those products include apple pies, cookies and pancakes.\n\nMcDonald's declined to comment Thursday.\n\nThe FDA proposal focuses on partially hydrogenated oils. A small amount of trans fat is naturally found in some meat and dairy products. The proposal would not affect that trans fat.'"

            "title": "Trouble in the air: Flight attendant fatigue hurts safety",
            "text": "\tHenry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his Anchorage, Alaska, hotel desperate to sleep. He had a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minneapolis-St. Paul. He remembers taking a sleeping pill - maybe two.\n\nThat return trip last summer ended his long career at Delta and Northwest airlines.\n\nLund, 49, says he has no memory of the incident that got him fired: shoving and berating another flight attendant.\n\nHis experience illustrates a broader problem for the nation's flight attendants. They work with less rest than foreign flight attendants and can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do. Yet they share responsibility with pilots for passenger safety.\n\nFlight attendants exhausted from long hours and little rest have forgotten to carry out safety duties. In some cases they've forgotten to engage or disarm emergency chutes, and failed to properly stow baggage. The federal government says mishaps may have increased as airlines cut rest periods to save money.\n\n## Too Exhausted To Work?\n\n\"They're showing up to work impaired,\" said Peter Roma, who does research for the Federal Aviation Administration on sleep deprivation and fatigue.\n\nThe hazards of fatigue appear in flight attendants' own words.  Dozens of voluntary reports have been filed with the FAA.\n\n\"If there were an evacuation, I doubted my abilities,\" wrote one about the impact of working 12 hours without a break. \"I also felt like an endangerment to my passengers.\"\n\nAnother injured a foot after she was struck by full coffee pots she forgot to secure. \"This occurred because I was very tired,\" the flight attendant wrote. \"I did not sleep well the night prior ... constantly watching the clock in anticipation of my early wake-up call.\"\n\n\"None of us (was) alert enough to have been able to efficiently respond to an aircraft emergency,\" said another.\n\nThere has been plenty of concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest after the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in New York. Investigators determined that pilots in the crash were likely so fatigued, they couldn't operate the plane safely.\n\nThe FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty. The rule goes into effect next January.\n\n## Attendants Should Get Same Rest As Pilots\n\nBut the government has paid less attention to flight attendants. That's even though the FAA calls them \"safety professionals\" and the first line of defense in an emergency.\n\n\"These are not just cocktail waitresses, for God's sakes,\" said Jim Oberstar, a former chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who is now a transportation consultant in Washington, D.C. \"If the flight attendant has to get you out of that plane in 90 seconds, they have to be alert, at their top performance. They can't be run down.\"\n\nOne aviation expert thinks flight attendants should have rest requirements like those of pilots.\n\n\"Why would we not want to keep fatigue managed to the same degree?\" asked John Cox, a pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation safety company. \"The stresses are different, but the days are equally long or longer.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, rest times for many Northwest Airlines flight attendants shortened after the company was acquired by Delta Airlines. Their union contract also expired. \"Our duty days have gotten two to three hours longer in a lot of cases,\" said flight attendant Julianna Helminski.\n\nThe FAA typically requires at least nine hours' rest. That can be cut to eight hours on occasion.\n\n## Studies Show Attendants Getting Less Sleep\n\nFAA studies were conducted from 2008 through 2012 by its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Surveying thousands of flight attendants, they focused on sleep patterns of 200 working domestic and international flights. They revealed that:\n\n-U.S. flight attendants catch fewer than six hours' sleep a day on average on domestic routes. They get fewer than five hours' sleep on international layovers.\n\n-Sleep requirements declined during the recession. Airlines routinely scheduled flight crews \"up to the regulation limits,\" the FAA researchers wrote. The change \"could increase the likelihood of ... fatigue-related mishaps.\"\n\n-To cope with short rest, four of every 10 flight attendants used sleep aids during layovers.\n\nThe routine is familiar to an American Airlines flight attendant who flies between Miami, the Dominican Republic and Panama. He says he often works 14-hour days with a 10-hour layover twice a week.\n\n\"By the time you close that door behind you at the hotel, it's usually 9:30 or 10 o'clock,\" he said. He had a  wake-up call at 6:30 the next morning.\n\n\"The first thing I do when I get to the hotel is take my Ambien because it takes a good hour to kick in,\" he said. Ambien is one of the more popular prescription sleep aids. \"I can't sleep without it.\"\n\nOn short sleep, he said, he'll sometimes fail to make sure that carry-ons are stowed in overhead bins. He asked to not be named for fear that his airline would fire him.\n\nUnder FAA rules, pilots \"are generally prohibited from using prescription or over-the-counter medications for sleep,\" a spokesman said. But airlines are allowed to decide if flight attendants can use sleeping pills.\n\n## Bad Sides Effects From Sleeping Pill?\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration label has a warning about Ambien and other sleep aids with the ingredient Zolpidem. They've been linked to rare but \"serious side effects\" that include \"more outgoing or aggressive behavior than normal, confusion, agitation.\"\n\nThat described the behavior Lund supposedly showed on his final flight. According to his employee file, other attendants and passengers saw Lund shoving a colleague and calling him a jerk.\n\nLund's reported behavior was out of character for the 14-year veteran, said Tim Oyler, a former Northwest manager who oversaw flight attendants. \"He was known as an excellent flight attendant. ... I was shocked when I heard.\" '"

            "text": "\tPHILADELPHIA - For the poor, food is not only scarce - often, it also can be rotting and covered in germs.\n\nCorner stores and small supermarkets that feed many poor people who live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, offer bacteria-laced foods in unhealthy conditions, a new study shows. Eating such foods can lead to foodborne illness, or food poisoning.\n\nCustomers agree with the study.\n\n\"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten, and the mice are having a good time in boxes of noodles,\" said Rodney Jenkins, 47. \"I ate bad fruit from a corner store and got sick.\"\n\nJenkins worries about feeding his children with so few worthwhile food choices.\n\n\"It's horrible,\" he said. \"When we get food up here, it's like we get the end of all food, the last batch of it.\"\n\n## Not Enough Grocery Stores\n\nFor years, there have been attempts to get fruits, vegetables and other main foods into so-called food deserts like North Philadelphia.\n\n\"Food desert\" is a term for places where there is not a lot of access to good, fresh produce. They aren't real deserts and can be anywhere from rural small towns to poor parts of big cities. Often, a food desert will have fast-food restaurants and corner stores, but very few places for people to buy groceries.\n\nUntil now, there has never been an investigation of food safety risks that desert-dwellers face.\n\nThe new study is being conducted by scientist Jennifer Quinlan.\n\nQuinlan studies the bacteria in food. She and her team visited nearly 400 corner stores and small supermarkets between 2008 and 2010. The goal was to study small organisms that live in milk, eggs, lunch meat, sandwiches and ready-to-eat fresh fruits and greens.\n\nThe results of the study were scary.\n\n\"We found milk likely to have more bacteria,\" Quinlan said. \"And when we could find fresh produce, it had a lot of contamination on it.\"\n\n## Food Poisoning Has Many Symptoms\n\nFoodborne illness is tricky to detect. Some might not know they have it, since symptoms - cramps, diarrhea, vomiting - can be caused by many factors.\n\nFortunately, food poisoning is rarely deadly. Recent estimates show that of 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States in a year, there were fewer than 1,500 deaths.\n\nMuch of the damage done by foods gone bad in corner stores is to poor people's wallets.\n\nFor example, many corner-store owners get milk from larger stores, and transport it in their own cars. Milk spoils faster under such conditions when it is not kept cold.\n\nSimilarly, Quinlan found that newly delivered milk will often stand outside refrigerators for long periods. In many cases, there are too few employees to put it away quickly.\n\nA customer then finds the milk goes bad much sooner than expiration dates show. Because the smell of spoiled milk keeps anyone from drinking it, the result is not foodborne illness but wasted dollars, Quinlan said.\n\n## Even Salad In Bags Has Germs\n\nIn corner stores, she found a high amount of microbes in bagged salad, strawberries and cucumbers, indicating that the food was close to spoiling. Many times the items rotted soon after purchase, another waste.\n\nIt was not uncommon to see mice in stores, Quinlan said. As a result, many corner stores keep cats, who carry their own germs.\n\nAdditionally, Quinlan found evidence of fecal coliforms in foods.\n\nFecal coliform is a group of bacteria that was possibly contaminated from human or animal waste. E. coli is a fecal coliform.\n\nPeople can eat fecal coliform without harm - but it may mean other disease-causing bacteria are in the food.\n\nWhen Quinlan and her researchers tested ready-to-eat salad greens, they found fecal coliforms in every single batch.\n\nSimilarly, eggs in corner stores were often found to be unrefrigerated, making them a possible source of salmonella poisoning. Salmonella comes from contaminated water or food and can attack the intestines.\n\nAlong with corner stores, Quinlan also studied food handling in private homes, many of them poor.\n\nMore than 42 percent of the refrigerators were too warm, and several homes had no refrigerators at all. A few lacked hot water. More than two-thirds were infested with pests, including mice.\n\nPoor people realize that they have few options in protecting themselves from bad food.\n\n\"If you're living on the edge and not getting enough to eat, you make riskier choices in order to eat,\" food microbiologist Donald Schaffner said.\n\n## Making The Best Of Bad Food\n\nNutritionist Debra Palmer works on food-related issues with poor New Jersey residents.\n\nWhen they are stuck with bad food, those people make the best of it, Palmer said. They wash slime off lunch meats, cut mold from cheese and bread, slice off rotten parts of fruit, then simply eat what's left.\n\nPalmer said that people will buy warm, discounted meat from old trucks that drive through poor neighborhoods. Many report getting food from dumpsters outside restaurants.\n\nQuinlan said she recognized the need to get impoverished people in food deserts to eat more fruits and vegetables. However, from a microbiologist's viewpoint, \"if people can't store and keep food safely, you're not doing them any favors getting them that food,\" she said.\n\n\"There are good frozen, canned and dried food options\" that may be safer, she added.\n\nUltimately, in the choice between eating and food safety, it's no contest.\n\n\"This population is more concerned about access to food than food safety,\" said Benjamin Chapman, an expert on food safety. \"The first step is just getting food, whatever the means.\"\n\nHe added, \"The biggest risk is not eating at all.\"'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - It's lunchtime. But high school junior Parrish Jackson has barely touched her turkey burger and apricots.\n\nShe's dumping them into the trash can.\n\nThe apricots are \"sour,\" says the 16-year-old at Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles. The meat is \"nasty.\" If it were up to her, she would just have taken the potato wedges and headed to the student store to fuel up on hot Cheetos and juice.\n\nAnd so it goes on hundreds of campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The district is the nation's second-largest school system and serves 650,000 meals a day. Students throw out at least $100,000 worth of food a day - and probably far more, according to David Binkle, the district's food services director.\n\nThat comes to $18 million a year - based on the estimate that 10 percent of the food is wasted. The money, Binkle says, would be far better spent on higher quality food, such as strawberries or watermelons.\n\n## Rules On Calories, Portions\n\nBut under [federal school meals rules](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch), Jackson and other students must take at least three items - including one fruit or vegetable - even if they don't want them. Otherwise, the federal government won't pay back school districts for the meals.\n\n\"What can we do about this?\" Binkle says, \"We can stop forcing children to take food they don't like and throw in the garbage.\"\n\nMany nutrition and health experts disagree. They point to studies that show that kids who are repeatedly served fruits and vegetables will eventually eat more of them.\n\nThat, in turn, will help keep kids from becoming [overweight](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity), says William J. McCarthy. He is a UCLA professor of health policy and management.\n\nMcCarthy said the extra cost is worth it to get kids to eat healthy. These food will lengthen their lives and prevent health problems, he said.\n\nThe differing views reflect arguments over improving child nutrition without massive food waste and rising costs. The $11.6 billion federal school lunch program feeds 31 million students daily. The rules are part of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act championed by first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nIt forced a dizzying set of rules about calories, portion sizes, even the color of fruits and vegetables. The rules increased the amount of fruits, vegetables and whole grains that must be offered. And this costs school districts a lot of money.\n\n## Take And Toss\n\nFor Binkle and many other school food managers, the hardest change is that schools must offer both a fruit and vegetable. Previously schools had to offer one or the other.\n\nThe extra food costs school districts $5.4 million a day. But about $3.8 million of that is being tossed in the trash, according to national estimates.\n\nA study discovered that 40 percent of all the lunches served in four Boston schools are thrown out. In the LA Unified District, many students don't want to eat fruits or vegetables, according to McCarthy, who co-wrote  the study.\n\nNationally, the cost of wasted food may be more than $1 billion each year. A federal survey found that 48 states say food waste and higher costs are their top challenges.\n\nIn response, the School Nutrition Association is trying to change the child nutrition law. The association represents 55,000 school food providers.\n\nAmong other things, the group wants to remove the requirement forcing students to take a fruit or vegetable.\n\n\"We're not opposed to healthy changes,\" said Julia Bauscher, the group's president-elect. \"We just want changes that don't unnecessarily increase cost and force students to take foods they have no intention of eating.\"\n\n## Calling Celebrity Chefs\n\nOther nutrition experts are pushing back. Juliana Cohen is a Harvard University nutrition research fellow. She said the rules have helped children eat healthier food. That's particularly important for inner-city, low-income students who get up to half their daily calories from school meals. She co-wrote a study that found that students in Boston ate more fruits and vegetables after the new rules took effect - although they still threw away much of them.\n\nThe solution to waste, Cohen and others say, isn't to end the rules but to find other ways to get children to eat their veggies. This includes working with professional chefs to make meals tastier, planting school gardens and scheduling recess before lunch.\n\nAt LA Unified, celebrity chefs, such as Jamie Oliver, have helped develop menus. More than 270 schools offer \"harvest of the month\" lessons about produce, and about 450 schools have started campus gardens.\n\nStill the food piles up in school trash cans.\n\nAt Washington Prep, a few students said they ate their entire lunches. Daniel Ofa, a sophomore, said he doesn't really enjoy the spaghetti or enchiladas but downs them anyway.\n\n\"Since we're football players, we eat all of it, bad or good,\" he said.\n\n\"If the food was good food, we'd have no problems,\" said senior A'lea Rendey, who pulled a hair from her turkey burger. She then dumped her food and headed off to the school store for a Pop-Tart.'"

She darted into the street and was hit by a drunk driver, who never slowed down or stopped. As a result of the accident, Daniela lost the use of her hips and legs.\n\nDaniela is in her first year of Glenbard West High School just outside of Chicago, Illinois. Now 15, she said the horrific experience gives her strength as she navigates life in her new country.\n\n\"I could feel sorry for myself for the rest of my life,\" Daniela said. \"Or I could accept being in a wheelchair, and try to make the best of it.\"\n\n## Class Project Becomes A Book\n\nDaniela told her story as part of a class project in her English as a learned language class. Like Daniela, most of the students were born in other countries and learned English only after coming to the United States.\n\nLed by teacher Sarah Hoisington, the teens spent all fall writing stories about the biggest hardships they have faced. They then compiled their experiences into a large book they called the \"Book of Challenges.\"\n\nEarlier, the group dedicated the book to the library at Hadley Junior High School, which several of the students attended before high school. They recently returned to the school to share their stories with students from countries around the world.\n\nBruno Borges, 15, liked telling his story to the younger students, who also have faced challenges in life. \"It was fun to tell the kids that everyone has to pass through obstacles,\" he said.\n\n## Empowering Stories\n\nHoisington's 13 students are from India, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, Myanmar, Brazil, Guatemala and Colombia. The idea for the project began after the group read \"A Long Walk to Water\" by Linda Sue Park. Part of the story features an 11-year-old Sudanese refugee who travels the African continent looking for safe places to live.\n\nSome students told their own stories of living in refugee camps, after their homes became too dangerous. Others focused on the severe culture shock they experienced in a new country.\n\n\"I wanted them to feel empowered,\" Hoisington said. She wants her students to recognize that the skills they have learned to survive hardships do not just help them in school, but will help them throughout their lives. \"Their stories are powerful not just for themselves, but for other people to hear and understand,\" Hoisington said.\n\n## Finding Confidence And Persistence\n\nNoushin Ajmeri hails from eastern India. She said she had to adjust to how boldly American girls behaved when her family moved to the United States two years ago.\n\n\"I felt embarrassed that the girls wore shorts in the summer, and talked and hug boys,\" said Noushin, 14. \"In our culture, we never talk with boys like that, we never speak up in front of people. But after two or three months, I started to speak English and I got used to it. I don't think their way is wrong. It's your choice to do what you want.\"\n\nBruno, who is originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil, has had to get used to a new country not once, but twice. When he was 7, his family moved to Sweden. They returned home to Brazil for several years before moving to Illinois this summer.\n\n\"Here, at least I knew a little English,\" Bruno said of the most recent move. \"You need to be confident and you need to expect the best of yourself.\" He said that kids moving to a new place need to be social and talk to many people, although that can be hard. Using these tactics, he has made lots of friends in America, he said.\n\nEma Smith shared a similar message of persistence with the younger teens. The 18-year-old said she felt frustrated when her family moved from Zacapa, Guatemala, to Glendale Heights, Illinois, in April 2013. Slowly things got easier as she began celebrating small victories, like when she felt confident enough to ask her teacher for a bathroom break or when she made a new friend in class.\n\nShe said that while these events may not seem like much, they were important moments for her. Ema is now a senior and about to graduate from high school. \"I am proud that I did not give up. It is OK to take things one day at a time,\" she said.'"

            "title": "Tennessee program proves that aging out of foster care is not a dead end",
            "text": "\tAs a foster youth, Michael McKernan faced many challenges growing up. His father was in prison, and his mother abandoned him and his siblings, leaving them in the care of their stepfather. When his stepfather lost his job and got kicked out of his house, McKernan went to live with his aunt, his third guardian in three years. That didn't last long either. She soon ran off with her boyfriend, leaving McKernan stranded once again.\n\nWithout a stable home life, McKernan dropped out of high school and started working as an overnight stocker at Wal-Mart. When he turned 18, he became a legal adult and aged out of the foster care system.\n\n## Hope Around The Corner\n\nMcKernan's life turned around when he met William Childress, a social worker with the program YVLifeSet, which is run by the national non-profit Youth Villages. YVLifeSet operates in nine states and offers extra help to former foster kids transitioning to adulthood. McKernan was no longer alone.\n\nMcKernan was living with his grandmother when he met Childress, and when he heard about the YVLifeSet program, he gladly accepted the social worker's offer to participate. Childress became McKernan's counselor and helped him to set goals for himself. He nudged him, the way a father would, checking in regularly by text message and giving McKernan steady encouragement and advice.\n\nMcKernan soon set his sights on college. Because he was a former foster youth, the government might help him pay for college, but he would first have to pass the GED, a standardized test students can take to make up for not finishing high school.\n\nHe studied hard, staying up late with thick practice books and Monster energy drinks. He wanted to go further than the parents who abandoned him.\n\n## Dreams Dashed\n\nMcKernan decided he would take the test on Dec. 11, the last day the test was offered in his county that year. His heart pounded as he approached the community college where the test was being given. He walked up to the sign-in table and gave his name. The woman checked her list and told him that he was not registered and therefore, could not take the exam.\n\nMcKernan said his body went numb and grim thoughts flooded his head. No exam this year. No college, ever. He could have sworn he had signed up for the test. He went home, feeling hopeless, wondering if overnights at Wal-Mart were all life had to offer him. He knew that he could take the test next year, but by then it would be too late to get help paying for the cost of college. He could not possibly pay for it on his own.\n\n## Deep Breath And Regroup\n\nOn that December day, Childress happened to be in town. When he stopped by McKernan's grandmother's house just to check in, he saw the gloomy look on the teenager's face and knew something was wrong. The story spilled from McKernan's mouth.\n\n\"Now wait,\" Childress told him. \"Let's see what we can do.\"\n\nThey called state employees, test runners, and social workers in the foster care community. They learned about an exam the following week in another county and Childress found money for the fee. McKernan would get to take the test after all.\n\nHe passed.\n\nHe got into Volunteer State Community College and finished his last final of the semester in early May, and he now dreams of studying abroad.\n\nMcKernan and Childress have their last weekly session next month, but they plan to stay in contact, like many college-age sons and fathers, by texting.\n\n## Aging Out Into The World\n\nMcKernan's story is not unique. Of the thousands of children who grow up in foster care, some live with relatives, like McKernan, and some live with other families or in group homes. Every year, roughly 23,000 teenagers nationwide like McKernan age out of the system.\n\nTransitioning to adulthood is particularly hard for former foster youth. Erin Valentine is a researcher who studies adult outcomes for kids who grew up in the foster care system. She said that former foster youth face tougher odds than other young adults.\n\n\"They turn 18 and suddenly, technically they're adults,\" Valentine said. \"They try hard. But when you have limited support, even the smallest slip-up can throw everything off track.\"\n\nValentine wanted to better understand how to help. So she designed a study to try to find out what happens to young adults who receive additional support.\n\n## Program's Study Group Benefited\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Valentine's team of researchers followed 1,322 young adults in Tennessee, ages 18 to 24, who had recently aged out of foster care or the juvenile custody system. About 790 continued to get support through YVLifeSet, while the others did not.\n\nThe YVLifeSet group received weekly counseling from a case manager for up to nine months. They went over how to apply for a job or get help paying for college. They talked about forming healthy relationships and avoiding drugs. In other words, Valentine said, the case managers act like stand-in parents.\n\nResearchers interviewed the young adults after a year. They discovered those in YVLifeSet were 22 percent less likely to be homeless than the young adults who weren't in YVLifeSet. Participants in YVLifeSet also saw higher part-time annual earnings.\n\nValentine's findings suggest that YVLifeSet and programs like it make a big impact in the lives of former foster youth.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - It's not easy peddling fresh fruit to a nation of junk-food lovers. But in rural California, David Cain is working to win the stomachs and wallets of U.S. grocery shoppers.\n\nCain is a fruit breeder. His latest invention is called the Cotton Candy grape. Bite into one of these green globes and the taste triggers the unmistakable sensation of eating a puffy, pink ball of spun sugar.\n\nCain and other breeders put together select traits of thousands of grapes. They have developed patented varieties that pack enough sugar they may as well be Skittles on the vine. That's no accident.\n\n\"We're competing against candy bars and cookies,\" said Cain, 62. He is a former scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) who now heads research at privately owned International Fruit Genetics in Bakersfield, Calif.\\n## Breeding And Branding\n\nThe marketplace for fruit is very competitive. So breeding and branding have become almost as valuable to farmers as sun and soil. Producers are constantly tinkering. They hope to come up with the next Cuties Clementine orange or Honeycrisp apple - distinct products that stand out in the crowded fruit aisle.\n\n\"People are looking for more flavor,\" said Mark Carroll at Gelson's Markets, which will carry the Cotton Candy grape. \"Once they get hooked, they want more no matter what.\"\n\nCain's company, in the heart of California's $1.1 billion table grape industry, specializes in bold flavors and unusual shapes. Purple Funny Fingers are long and thin like chili peppers. A variety named Sweet Sapphire come as round and fat as D batteries. Like the Cotton Candy, the special varieties are patented, then licensed to growers.\n\nOrdinary grapes can cost as little as 88 cents per pound. The Cotton Candy could fetch around $6 a pound, though prices would come down if enough farmers grow the grape.\n\nThe U.S. designer-fruit craze kicked into high gear in the late 1980s.  A Californian fruit combining traits of a plum and apricot called the pluot hit the market. The crispy stone fruit took 20 years to develop. It proved such a hit with consumers that it inspired more farmers to put money into breeding programs to boost sales.\\n## Pluots To Peacharines\n\nCalifornia is now putting out other sweet inventions, including apriums (a pluot but with more apricot), peacharines (peach and nectarine) and cherums (cherry and plum).\n\nCross-breeding methods used by fruit breeders are centuries old. In the case of grapes, pollen from male grape flowers is extracted and then carefully brushed onto the female clusters of the target plant. Then comes a lot of waiting. Then replanting. Then repeating the process - for years, even decades.\n\n\"It's a bit like fishing. You never know when you're going to get the big one,\" said Cain. He is a soft-spoken man who would look every bit the lab coat-wearing scientist if it weren't for the soil under his nails.\n\nAlthough some of these grapes have been bred for higher sugar content, nutritionists don't seem all that bothered.\n\n\"You would have to eat about 100 grapes to consume the same amount of calories in a candy bar,\" said David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition.\n\nCain got his start in the 1970s as a researcher with the USDA, developing new varieties of table grapes and seedless raisins in Fresno, Calif. Back then, most fruit breeding was done by the government or universities that could afford the time-consuming and expensive work.\n\nIn 1987 he moved into private business. U.S. grape consumption was exploding at the time, thanks to new seedless varieties developed in California.\\n## Obsessed With A Grape\n\nCain helped start International Fruit Genetics in 2001. A few months later, he tasted the grape that has obsessed him ever since.\n\nResearchers from the University of Arkansas were showing off a purple Concord grape that didn't look like much. The flesh was mushy and speckled with tiny seeds. The skin slipped off easily after biting, a no-no in the grape business. But the cotton candy flavor transported Cain to a carnival or county fair.\n\nWhat if he could take the unique flavor of that Eastern U.S. grape and meld it with Californian qualities such as superior crunch, thin skin and generous size?\n\nInternational Fruit Genetics signed a licensing agreement with the University of Arkansas. By 2003, Cain was breeding their grapes with a dozen California varieties on his test field.\n\nOn a recent weekday, Cain showed why he spends half his time outdoors. Rows and rows of vines needed to be inspected in search of the next big thing. Carrying a tool to measure the sugar content of each grape, Cain methodically tasted his berries. He decides what to keep and what to toss. With 300 kinds of grapes to taste on each row, swallowing the fruit is out of the question.\n\n\"I've learned to do a lot of spitting,\" Cain said.\\n## Niche Grape Or Revolutionary?\n\nIt was this same painstaking process that led Cain to find the ideal mate for his spun-sugar-flavored Concord, a green beauty called Princess. That variety was developed by the USDA and is known for its crisp feel and juiciness.\n\nThe Cotton Candy was patented in 2010. A Bakersfield grower is set to harvest the first large crop in August.\n\nCain doesn't like to fuss over such milestones, but the Cotton Candy has him excited. He thinks its signature flavor has a chance to hook consumers like nothing before.\n\n\"It's going to be introduced slowly,\" Cain said. \"Whether it will be a niche grape or start a revolution is hard to say. What we're hoping is it will do for grapes what all these new varieties have done for fruit like apples.\"'"

            "text": "\tMATSUMOTO, Japan - The 12-year-old girl didn't want to leave her younger brother, and her grandparents didn't want her to go away. But the family lives near the \"no-go zone\" surrounding Japan's destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant and has other things to consider. Her safety, they decided, must come first.\n\nYukie Hashimoto and her husband sent their daughter 200 miles away, to the picturesque ski town of Matsumoto. The mayor there had offered to take in and educate young people living in the shadow of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.\n\nResearch has not shown the children to be in clear danger from exposure to low-dose radiation. Still, many people near Fukushima do not trust the government to tell the truth about how severe the radiation levels really are. The Hashimoto family, and the parents of seven other children, decided to accept the mayor's offer.\n\n\"I didn't really believe things are as safe as the government is telling us,\" said Hashimoto, who lives in Koriyama, about 20 miles west of the 12-mile no-go zone. \"We made our decision with her future, 10 years and 20 years later, in mind.\"\n\n## Eight From Fukushima\n\nThe eight students - seven in junior high school and one in elementary school - began their new lives this month, with the beginning of Japan's school year. They live in a rented house with bunk beds and live-in caretakers.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of Matsumoto's mayor, Akira Sugenoya. A medical doctor, Sugenoya performed more than 100 thyroid-cancer operations in neighboring Belarus after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in Ukraine.\n\nFor those outside the largely off-limits 12-mile zone, taking such an extreme step is relatively rare. The Hashimoto family took some time to make their decision.\n\nA wide range of views on the risks of radiation has divided both their family and entire communities. Hashimoto was nervous about speaking to a reporter, because raising questions can get one branded as a troublemaker. She requested that her daughter not be named for fear of a backlash.\n\nLike many near the Fukushima plant, Hashimoto routinely measured the radioactivity in her neighborhood. Some spots were a bit high, registering in a gray area where scientists are divided about the long-term effects. Still, children, she knew, are far more likely to be harmed by radiation than adults.\n\nThe girl's grandparents and her college-age brother find the fretting about radiation ridiculous. But for the 12-year-old herself, the sticking point was her 5-year-old younger brother, who cannot be part of the program, which starts at third grade.\n\nThe girl said she was worried she wouldn't be there to watch over the boy - she had been making sure he wore masks and didn't eat local food.\n\n## \"No One Knows For Sure\"\n\nThen the girl started getting nosebleeds and growing pale, and seemed to have no energy. That may have had nothing to do with radiation, but it made Hashimoto decide to get her out, and her husband relented.\n\n\"The low-dose radiation is continuing,\" Hashimoto said. \"There is no precedent\" - meaning, nothing like this has ever happened before. \"We don't know what effect that will have on our children.\"\n\nSo far, 33 children have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer in Fukushima in the last three years, among 270,000 checked. Thyroid cancer among children is very rare: Out of a million children, no more than a handful of cases would normally be expected.\n\nStill, some experts say the higher cases are merely a result of more thorough checking. Also, they point out, the surge in thyroid cancer cases in Belarus and Ukraine did not surface until four or five years after the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nThe U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has concluded that cancer rates won't increase in a recognizable way. It estimated that \"fewer than 1,000 children\" are at risk of developing thyroid cancer.\n\n\"The bottom line is: No one knows for sure. What we do know is that the cases of cancer are up, and so naturally we are worried,\" said Hiroshi Ueki, a former Fukushima resident who moved with his wife and two children and now oversees the Matsumoto project. The project relies heavily on donations and parents pay 30,000 yen ($300) a month to cover basic living expenses.\n\n## Fukushima Friends Stick Together\n\nA recent government study found that one in four children from the area struck by the 2011 tsunami disaster, including Fukushima, suffered emotional problems.\n\nKokoro Kamiyama, 13, the first child to sign on to the Matsumoto project, often skipped school when she was in Fukushima. Her mother believes that behavior resulted from her daughter's worries about radiation.\n\nLiving through the 2011 disaster made her decide to be a doctor when she grows up, she says in a soft voice. She is happy she can run around outdoors in Matsumoto without wearing a mask.\n\n\"The air feels so clean here,\" Kamiyama said. \"I love playing badminton. And tag.\"\n\nLast Friday, she looked very much at home as she sat in the gymnasium decorated with flowers at Aida Junior High School for a school opening ceremony.\n\nSo did Hashimoto's daughter, though she had a rough start in Matsumoto. She was in constant tears for the first few days, but by Friday she said she had made lots of great friends.\n\nThose friends are mostly other students from Fukushima. They're sticking together.'"

            "title": "German ancestors spring back to the future as students translate obituaries",
            "text": "\tBELLEVILLE, Ill. - The fourth-year German students at Belleville East High School had a challenging task - translating notices of peoples' deaths from German into English. The death notices, or obituaries, were published in a German newspaper in Belleville, Illinois, during the 1800s.\n\nThe obituaries were originally published in an old German alphabet known as Fraktur. Students took different approaches to this extra level of difficulty. Seniors Colin Creedon and Daniel Jackson chose to translate the Fraktur into modern German first. Then they translated the German text into English.\n\n\"We have to translate it and then rearrange it so it makes sense in English,\" Creedon explained.\n\nIn contrast, seniors Meghan Gingrich and Peyton Kaercher chose to translate the old German directly into English. \"Once you know what the words say, it's really easy,\" Kaercher said.\n\n## Found In Translation\n\nThe class assignment overseen by teacher Andrew Gaa isn't just for a grade. It serves a larger purpose and has helped at least one family from California learn more about their ancestry.\n\nOnce translated by the German students and reviewed by Gaa, the obituaries are then posted online by the St. Clair County Genealogical Society. That's where Craig Eberhard of San Diego, California, found the obituary of his great-great grandfather. He recently sent an email to Gaa, thanking him and the two students who translated it.\n\nEberhard said the work the German students do is \"to be appreciated and admired. Without that, I never would have known that history of my great-great grandfather.\"\n\n## Coming To America\n\nThe obituary of his great-great grandfather, Eberhard said, allowed him to \"connect some of the dots\" of his family's history.\n\n\"There was so much information in there,\" he said of the obituary. \"It gave a little bit of color to my great-great grandfather.\"\n\nEberhard's great-great grandfather, Friedrich Pannier, was born in 1832 and died in 1893. Pannier was a farmer who came to Belleville in 1866 by way of the German sailing ship, the Undine. He brought his wife and five children, including Eberhard's great grandfather, William, who was 6 years old at the time. William moved from Belleville to Orange County, California.\n\n## Getting \"Into The Flow\" Of Fraktur\n\nGaa said the German students are providing \"a service to people\" who can't read German and don't live locally and so can't read the old newspapers on microfilm at the Belleville Public Library.\n\nThe assignment to translate the obituaries is challenging for the 19 students in his fourth-year German class, according to Gaa. \"Old German script is hard to read,\" he said. The students agree.\n\n\"The letters that they used are not what they would look like now,\" said senior Thomas Carter. \"The letters they used back then are obscure.\"\n\nGingrich said some of the letters in Fraktur look exactly the same. \"Once you get into the flow of it, it becomes easier,\" said senior Madelyne Knipp. \"A lot of times, I just use the context clues to figure it out.\"\n\nThe students don't have to tackle it alone. They work with partners, and Gaa is available to help as well. \"The challenge is translating it and making it sound like good English,\" Gaa said. \"There's definitely an art to it.\"\n\nGingrich said it is \"really neat\" to be involved in a project that could potentially help someone find out more about their ancestors. \"I would like to trace my own ancestry sometime,\" she said.\n\nKnipp said it's \"really cool\" to translate the old German obituaries into English. \"I like translating this stuff, knowing it's going to help people.\"\n\n## A Stickler For Accuracy\n\nOnce the obituaries are translated into English by the students, they type them up and submit them to Gaa for review. Gaa must ensure the obituaries are entirely accurate since they will be placed online and used to research family history. \"I'm interested in Belleville history, so it's worthwhile for me,\" Gaa said.\n\nThe German students translate obituaries as an in-class assignment twice a year - one time each semester. \"By the second time, it's much easier for them to do,\" Gaa said.\n\nGaa actually learned about his own family history through this project, which started in the fall of 2012.\n\n## Translating Like It's 1899\n\nSo far, the students are almost through obituaries published in 1898. They will move on to 1899 next.\n\nDiane Walsh, with the St. Clair County Genealogical Society, said she appreciates the work Gaa and his students put into the project.\n\n\"It takes a great deal of effort on their part,\" Walsh said. \"It's invaluable to get some of that information out there.\"\n\nThe most important thing about the German obituaries is they mention the particular town the immigrant came from, according to Walsh. \"I know people in the genealogical community are very grateful for work people do to bring ancestors to life,\" Walsh said, \"and that's what this project is about.\"'"

            "text": "\tFERGUSON, Mo. - A Justice Department report released Wednesday accused the Ferguson Police Department and courts of unfairly targeting African-Americans. The report found that police searched people without a legal reason, abused their authority and routinely violated civil rights.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson will not face any federal charges over the shooting of a black teenager named Michael Brown. On Aug. 9, Wilson, who is white, killed Brown even though he was unarmed. Brown's death set off months of protests and led the Justice Department to begin its six-month investigation into policing in Ferguson.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday said that the Ferguson police and courts had \"severely undermined the public trust.\" They created a \"tensely charged atmosphere, where people feel under assault, under siege.\"\n\nNow, the city must respond to the report.\n\n## Culture Of Police Brutality\n\nWill leaders agree to make the more than two dozen changes the Justice Department recommended? Will they challenge the findings? Could the city afford to follow the government's recommendations, which could be expensive? Could it afford not to?\n\nIf city leaders had answers to these questions on Wednesday, they did not say.\n\nAt a brief news conference, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles read a statement, but did not take any questions. He said the city had suspended two employees and fired another for writing racist emails. The city also stopped charging some court fees and hired three African-American women.\n\n\"We must do better,\" Knowles said, \"not only as a city, but as a state and as a country.\"\n\nFerguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson did not speak at the news conference, nor has he returned phone calls seeking comment. The report depicts his department as tolerating a culture of police brutality and using the police officers to bring in money through court fines.\n\nOn Tuesday, three federal Department of Justice officials went over the report with top Ferguson officials. They stressed that the process of reaching an agreement with Ferguson has only begun. The department still can go to court to force the city to change.\n\n## Abused By The System\n\nThe 102-page report discusses dozens of cases of people abused by the system.\n\nIn one of those, a 32-year-old black man was sitting in a car after playing basketball. A police officer stopped him because his windows were too dark and ordered him out of the car and asked to search it.\n\nWhen the man refused, citing his constitutional rights, \"The officer reportedly pointed a gun at his head, and arrested him,\" the report says.\n\nFerguson police expect and demand obedience even when they have no legal right, the report said.\n\n## Blacks And Whites Treated Differently\n\nAfrican-Americans make up 67 percent of the population in Ferguson. They accounted for 85 percent of all traffic stops. They received 90 percent of traffic tickets. Also, 93 percent of the people arrested by Ferguson police over the last two years were black. Many of them were arrested just for walking down the street.\n\nThe report says African-Americans and whites were treated differently by the Ferguson police and courts. At each point, the police department \"enforces the law more harshly against black people than others,\" stated the report.\n\nThe investigation found seven racist emails that had circulated among police and court employees from 2008 to 2011. One of them depicted President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee.\n\nEven as recently as a month ago, officers violated people's right to free speech, the report says. On Feb. 9, several people were peacefully protesting outside the Ferguson police station.\n\nTwo Ferguson police vehicles sped out of the parking lot, and an officer announced, \"Everybody here's going to jail.\" A man who recorded the scene was himself arrested for interfering with police. Officers pushed him to the ground and began handcuffing him. A video showed the man was neither interfering nor resisting.\n\n## Raising Money Through Court Fines\n\nAlso, the report says Ferguson used its police and courts to raise money. Often, this came at the expense of people who were poor and African-American.\n\nThe report said Ferguson used its police department as \"a collection agency\" to bring in money for the town.\n\nThe department has recommended 26 reforms to the city's police department and court system.\n\nProposed police reforms include requiring a supervisor to approve arrests for many minor charges. The report suggests changing the rules about when officers can use force. Officers should also be trained in how to reduce violence and how to figure out when they are discriminating against people. The report also recommended involving regular citizens in police decision-making.\n\nOfficials said that Ferguson has already begun training for \"bias-free policing.\" It also has implemented changes in police and court policies.\n\nJustice Department officials said they knew that police departments, including Ferguson's, are short of cash.\n\nBut \"the cost of not doing this, not just monetarily, but otherwise, are pretty severe,\" a Justice Department official said.'"

            "text": "\tSAN FRANCISCO - People cannot be kept off a jury just because they are gay, a federal appeals court decided Tuesday.\n\nThe important decision expands juror protections. It also will be used to challenge other laws that limit gay rights, activists say.\n\nPeople cannot be excluded from juries because of their sex or race. But until Tuesday's decision, they could be kept off some juries if they were gay.\n\nThe decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was unanimous. It overturned a previous jury's verdict in a trial involving an AIDS drug. In that case, the judges said the trial was conducted unfairly, because a gay man was excluded from the jury without a good reason.\n\n## Ruling Affects 9 Western States\n\nCalifornia state courts do not allow gay people to be excluded from juries for no other reason. Tuesday's ruling extended the restriction to federal courts in California and courts in eight other Western states.\n\nThe decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays and lesbians differently. This includes laws against same-sex marriage, lawyers said. Gays are fighting laws in four Western states that prevent men from marrying men and women from marrying women. In those states, only men and women may marry each other.\n\nJudge Stephen Reinhardt said laws that discriminate must be closely evaluated. It's important to ensure that courts neither create nor reinforce bias or second-class status. Reinhardt was one of the three judges who said Tuesday that excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection.\n\nGay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted it would help them win the right to gay marriage in the other Western states. In California, same-sex marriage is legal.\n\n\"This is really a very big deal,\" said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal, a group that fights for gay rights. \"It is likely to have a significant impact on other cases.\"\n\nDavid Codell serves as the constitutional legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights. He said the decision would make it \"exceedingly difficult\" for states to discriminate against gays.\n\n## An AIDS Court Case\n\nThe ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a drug company, now called GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories, another drug company. The case involved a decision by Abbott to raise the price of an AIDS drug. This move angered the gay community. AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is a deadly disease transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids. This includes sexual contact. In many developed countries, many of those with AIDS are gay. It is a source of discrimination against gays.\n\nDuring the 2011 trial, a lawyer for Abbott prevented a man who revealed that he had a male partner from being on the jury. The man also said he had friends in the early stages of AIDS.\n\nThe Abbott lawyer said he had \"no idea\" whether the juror was gay. But he did not give another reason for keeping him off the jury. Before a jury trial, the lawyers for both sides pick the men and women of the jury.\n\nAfter the trial, the jury decided in favor of Abbott, and eventually GlaxoSmithKline claimed that Abbott excluded the juror because he was gay.\n\nOn appeal, Abbott gave several reasons for excluding the man. But the appeal judges said they were just excuses.\n\n\"Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen,\" Reinhardt wrote. \"It gives gay and lesbian individuals a means of (expressing) their values and a voice in resolving controversies\" that affect their lives.\n\n## Treating People As Individuals\n\nThe court said that gay jurors do not have to tell anyone they're gay. But if they do say something, they cannot be prevented from sitting on a jury because of it.\n\nKeeping gay people off juries sends a false message, Reinhardt wrote. It gives the impression that \"gays and lesbians could not be trusted to reason fairly on issues of great (importance) to the community or the nation,\" he wrote.\n\nLambda's Davidson said he did not know how often gay jurors were kept off juries. The issue has come up in about half a dozen cases across the country. Lawyers do not need to give a reason if they don't select a particular juror. But if asked, they must provide a reason that doesn't discriminate.\n\n\"People have stereotypes,\" the gay rights lawyer said. \"They think gay people will be liberal or, if it is a police case, may think gay people are against the police. Or a lawyer might think, 'I just don't think I will relate well to a gay person on a jury.'\"\n\nBut the point is, he said, the legal system should treat people as individuals, not stereotypes.\n\nLawyers can often get around the anti-discrimination requirement. But \"if the real reason is bias, they have to be quick on their feet to come up with another reason, and it has to be consistent with how they treated other jurors,\" Davidson said.\n\nAbbott could challenge the federal court ruling by asking a larger panel of judges to take another look at the case. Another option is to appeal to the Supreme Court.'"

Federal law applies in all fifty states.\n\nThe court also opened the door for gay marriages to resume in California, in a separate ruling on narrow legal grounds.\n\nThe decisions stopped short of saying that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage. The court did not decide whether states that do not have same-sex marriage will have to recognize marriages performed in other states. Twelve states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages. California is also expected to resume same-sex.\n\nPresident Barack Obama praised the court for its decisions.\n\n\"We are a people who declared that we are all created equal - and the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,\" he said in a statement.\n\n## Court Ruling On DOMA\n\nBut the issue of gay marriage causes heated arguments, with some saying that marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman. More than two-thirds of the states do not allow gay marriage.\n\nBoth cases were decided by 5-4 rulings. Different justices formed the majority in each decision.\n\nThe court threw out part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a bipartisan law that was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the law violated the Constitutional protection of liberty. He also said that the real reason for the law was to make same-sex marriage less important than marriage between a man and a woman.\n\n\"The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages,\" Kennedy wrote.\n\nThe opinion said that the case is limited to marriages that are legally recognized in  the states.\n\n## A Justice Dissents\n\nBut Justice Antonin Scalia said that it was not realistic to think the ruling will stop there.\n\nHe also said that majority was being unfair to people who opposed gay marriage.\n\n\"In the majority's telling, this story is black-and-white: Hate your neighbor or come along with us,\" he said.\n\nAt stake are a number of federal benefits and programs, including immigration rights, student loans and taxes.\n\nThe case was brought by Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007. Their marriage was recognized in New York, where they lived, when Spyer died in 2009. Windsor had to pay $363,053 in taxes on Spyer's estate that she would not have had to pay if, in her words, she had married \"Theo\" instead of Thea.\n\n## Many People Cheer Decisions\n\nThrongs of people on the Supreme Court Plaza in Washington cheered the rulings.\n\nThe court \"brings us that much closer to true equality,\" said David Boies. He was one of the attorneys who represented the plaintiffs who sued to overturn Proposition 8. That law, approved by California voters, made same-sex marriage illegal.\n\n\"Our plaintiffs now get to go back to California and, together with every other citizen of California, marry the person they love,\" he said.\n\nA state court threw out the law. California's then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declined to appeal the case. Others stepped in to defend the law. But in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court found that only California's elected officials had legal standing to defend the law.\n\n\"We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend the constitutionality of a state statute when state officials have chosen not to. We decline to do so for the first time here,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nKennedy was on the dissenting side in the California case. He said that Roberts failed to take into account California's system that lets voters make laws directly and not just through their representatives.\n\n## Speaking Against, And For, Rulings\n\nJohn Eastman of the National Organization for Marriage told CNN that the Supreme Court got it wrong in both cases.\n\n\"When you destroy or redefine the institution, all of society is going to be harmed,\"  he said.\n\nKris Perry, one of the plaintiffs in the California case, cheered the decision from the Supreme Court steps. She and her partner would be able to tell their four sons \"you're just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love.\"\n\nShe and Sandy Stier were married in San Francisco in 2004, but the state Supreme Court invalidated the relationship. The sons are from previous relationships.\n\nStier said the battle is not over.\n\n\"It's got to go nationwide, and we can't wait for that day,\" she said.'"

The states are Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nSame-sex couples in six other states should be able to get married soon. The states are Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming. All of these states tried to ban same-sex marriage. In each case, federal appeals court judges ruled that the states could not discriminate against gay people by preventing them from getting married.\n\nHowever, the appeals court rulings were put on hold while the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the cases or not. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. and its decisions are final, meaning no one can appeal them.\n\n## Court's Ruling Not Nationwide\n\nThe Supreme Court's action did not make same-sex marriage legal across the entire country. Still, those 11 states would bring to 30 the number of states where same-sex marriage is legal. Same-sex marriage is also legal in the District of Columbia.\n\nEvan Wolfson is the president of Freedom to Marry, a same-sex marriage advocacy group. He called on the high court to \"finish the job\" and make same-sex marriage legal through the U.S. Wolfson said the court's delay in letting gay people marry  \"prolongs the patchwork of state-to-state discrimination.\" He said it's harmful and insulting that gay people in so many states are not allowed to get married.\n\nEd Whelan is with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The group opposes same-sex marriage. He criticized the Supreme Court for not hearing the appeals of the five states and called the court \"irresponsible.\" Whelan said that so many states have same-sex marriage that the court would have a hard time eventually banning it.\n\nThe situation was changing rapidly Monday in many states.\n\n- In Virginia, marriage licenses could be given to same-sex couples as early as Monday afternoon.\n\n- In North Carolina, lawyers for same-sex couples planned to ask a judge to allow same-sex marriage.\n\n- In Oklahoma, one of the largest counties will give marriage licenses to same-sex couples as soon as it receives an order from the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n## Both Sides Say Settle The Issue\n\nPeople on both sides of the issue had expected the justices to decide gay marriage cases this term.\n\nThey both say that the justices have an obligation to settle an issue of such national importance. That responsibility should not be left to lower court judges. Because the Supreme Court did not hear the cases, these lower court judges made the decision.\n\nTwo other federal appeals courts could issue decisions any time in same-sex marriage cases. These appeals courts are in Cincinnati and San Francisco. Judges in the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit are weighing pro-gay marriage rulings in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. They seem more likely to support state bans on gay marriage than the appeal court judges in San Francisco. The judges in San Francisco will decide whether Idaho and Nevada can ban gay marriage.\n\nJames Esseks is with the American Civil Liberties Union. He thinks the Supreme Court would hear a case if a lower court upholds a state's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nFor the Supreme Court to hear an appeals case, four of the nine justices must vote to take it up. However, for a ruling in a case, a majority of at least five justices out of the nine is needed. It's not known how many justices voted to hear the gay marriage appeals case.\n\nFour of the justices take a more liberal approach to issues, like gay marriage, and four justices take a more conservative approach. Each group tends to vote the same way. Justice Anthony Kennedy is more or less in the middle. It appeared that neither side of the court wanted to take up the issue of gay marriage at this time. It also may be that Kennedy did not want to rule on same-sex marriage now. He would likely cast the deciding vote and break the tie.'"

            "title": "Georgia bill hopes to give gun owners more rights",
            "text": "\tThe proposed law's official name is the Safe Carry Protection Act.\n\nIts opponents call it the \"guns everywhere bill.\"\n\nThat's because the Georgia law would allow guns in bars, churches, airports and schools. Just waiting for governor's signature, the law has drawn national attention because of where it would let people carry guns.\n\nThe National Rifle Association, the national pro-gun group, called the bill's passage a \"historic victory for the Second Amendment.\" The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to own and carry guns. Americans for Responsible Solutions called it the most extreme gun bill in the nation. The group was founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting.\n\n## Making Guns More Available\n\nRecently, a number of states have loosened up on gun control laws. The states are responding to tragic shootings. But instead of making guns less available, their solution is to make guns more available.\n\nBut perhaps none has gone as far as Georgia, at least in a single bill.\n\nThe proposed law would allow licensed gun owners to take weapons into churches, synagogues and mosques, if its leaders allow it. People can carry guns into bars unless the owner says no. They can also carry guns into airports and government buildings. However, guns couldn't be taken past security checkpoints.\n\nThe law would also let schools give guns to staff members. And it would lower the age of gun licenses for members of the military from 21 to 18. If the law is signed, firearms could not be taken away during an emergency. This is what happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\"You're not going to stop crime by disarming good people,\" said Jerry Henry. He is the executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org, a group that pushed for the bill's passage. Pro-gun groups say that \"good\" people need to carry guns. They say this stops \"bad\" people from committing crimes.\n\nThe Georgia law has drawn national attention. Gun control groups think if they could stop Georgia from passing the law, they can keep other states from expanding gun rights, Henry said.\n\n## Guns In Church Called \"Dangerous\"\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal hasn't said whether he will sign the bill. But many think the Republican governor, who has an A rating from the NRA and is up for re-election, will sign it. The bill is popular in Georgia. If passed, the law would go into effect July 1.\n\nAnd the bill was supported by Deal's Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, former President Jimmy Carter's grandson.\n\nOpponents say they are worried about armed people attending city council meetings. City council meetings sometimes become emotional and fights can break out.\n\nLeaders of Georgia's churches disagree about the bill.\n\nFrancis J. Mulcahy is the executive director of the Georgia Catholic Conference. He expressed concern that more people would be shot if there guns could be carried more places. Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta, said that allowing guns in churches is \"dangerous.\"\n\nGeorgia's Episcopal bishops, Rob Wright and Scott Benhase, said it's hard to make sure that only the \"good\" guys get guns, because it's not always possible to know who the good guys are.\n\n\"People who had no criminal record and had a legal right to their weapons have (carried out) almost all of the recent tragic shootings in houses of worship and schools,\" the bishops said in a statement. \"They were 'good guys' until they weren't.\"\n\n## Support For Ending Gun Restrictions\n\nBut Mike Griffin, public affairs representative of the Georgia Baptist Convention, supports the legislation. He said that churches should set the rules for themselves.\n\n\"Georgia Baptists are not saying that they're for or against weapons being in churches,\" he said. \"What they're saying is churches should have the right to determine if they choose to have weapons.\"\n\nChris W. Cox is the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. He said the bill would make Georgia the 27th state to allow licensed gun owners to bring weapons into bars.\n\nThe legislation comes as a Gallup poll in January found more support for ending gun restrictions. The poll found that 16 percent supported making making guns more available. Just 5 percent supported this a year earlier. Last year's survey was conducted shortly after the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. Just 31 percent supported stricter gun laws, according to the January poll, down from 38 percent a year earlier.\n\nAdam Winkler is a University of California, Los Angeles law professor. He writes about the politics surrounding guns. He said the Georgia legislation \"shows how strong the NRA is in some parts of the country. They've defeated so many gun laws that ending bans on guns in bars and churches is all that's left.\"\n\nEmory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz noted that promoting gun rights is a way for some Republican politicians to make their supporters happy. Their supporters are in favor of laws that let people carry guns. The Georgia bill is a way of rewarding the people who vote for them, Abramowitz said.'"

            "title": "Charlie Hebdo's first edition comes out after last week's deadly attack",
            "text": "\tThe latest cover of the French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo shows the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. He is weeping and holding a sign that says, \"Je suis Charlie\" - \"I am Charlie.\" The headline reads, \"All is forgiven.\"\n\nThe issue is the first since the paper was attacked last week by extremists. Two gunmen shot and killed 12 people, including four cartoonists. Over the years, Charlie Hebdo has published cartoons critical of Islam, Christianity and Judaism and which show the Prophet Muhammad in an extremely negative way. Muslims do not show the prophet in drawings, and consider depictions of him to be very offensive.\n\nAt an emotional meeting Tuesday, staff members from Charlie Hebdo explained why they decided to put Mohammad on the cover again, although doing so got their co-workers killed. The latest issue - the first since the killings - is due out Wednesday.\n\n## \"With Pain And Joy\"\n\nGerard Biard, the editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, said the new issue was produced \"with pain and with joy.\" Three million copies will be published in many languages, in contrast to the usual run of 60,000 copies per week, he said.\n\nHe and cartoonist Renald Luzier, known as Luz, displayed the edition's controversial cover.\n\nLuzier described how he came up with the cover drawing following last week's attack.\n\n\"I said to myself, we must do a drawing that above all makes us laugh,\" Luzier said.\n\nHe then referred to the firebombing of the offices of Charlie Hebdo in 2011. Luzier said he chose to put Muhammad on the cover because \"he is a character that got our offices burned.\" Immediately after the 2011 bombing, Charlie Hebdo was hailed as a hero of press freedom, he said. \"Then a year later when we redrew the character, we were treated as dangerous, provocative and irresponsible,\" Luzier said.\n\n## Rubbed Tears From His Eyes\n\nIn the latest issue, Luzier drew Muhammad crying on the cover, he said, and then cried himself.\n\n\"This was not the front page the world wanted us to draw, it was our front page. This is not the front page that the terrorists want us to draw - there are no terrorists in it, just a man who cries,\" said Luzier, who has worked for Charlie Hebdo for 20 years.\n\n\"This Muhammad is so much nicer than the ones the terrorists\" describe, Biard said, holding the cover aloft. \"He's sympathetic. Look at him, he's crying!\"\n\nIt was one of the few light moments at the emotional meeting, during which Luzier repeatedly choked up or rubbed tears from his eyes.\n\nFrench police are continuing their investigation into last week's attack. Tuesday's meeting was held at the newspaper Liberacion, where Luzier and the rest of the Charlie Hebdo staff have been working this week in borrowed offices.\n\nThe day of the attack, Jan. 7, was Luzier's birthday. He was running late and did not arrive for work at Charlie Hebdo until after the attack was over.\n\n## \"We Can't Remain Silent\"\n\nLuzier conceded that many would find the cover of the latest issue offensive and said that \"there are risks\" to publishing another cover with Muhammad. However, he promised to keep drawing.\n\n\"We can't remain silent,\" he said.\n\n\"We trust people's intelligence, their sense of humor,\" he said. \"People who committed this attack are just people who lack humor.\"\n\n\"Yes I am Charlie,\" Luzier said. \"But I am also a cop. I am Jewish. I am Muslim. And I am atheist,\" which is a person who does not believe in God. Two police officers were killed in Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo.\n\nThe next day, a policewoman was killed by a different gunman. On Friday, the same gunman killed four Jewish people in an attack on a kosher grocery store. The gunman was killed by police. That also was the day the gunmen who had attacked Charlie Hebdo were killed by police.\n\nSince the attacks, many people in France have worn signs that said \"Je suis Charlie\" to stand with the slain cartoonists and show support for freedom of speech.\n\nLuzier spoke of \"complicated emotions\" following the attack. Many of his co-workers are still struggling emotionally with what happened, he said. Luzier added that he hopes they return to work at Charlie Hebdo soon.\n\nIf the press thrives and grows stronger, Luzier said, \"we have really won.\"'"

            "text": "\tTUCSON, Ariz. - Lizbeth Mateo won't be late for her first day of law school after all - despite being held by the government for two weeks weeks after protesting U.S. immigration laws. She and other members of the \"Dream 9\" were freed Wednesday while they seek asylum, which grants permission to stay in the U.S.\n\nMateo was born in Mexico, but has spent most of her 29 years in Los Angeles. She is set to begin studies at Santa Clara University School of Law on Monday. Now she's even more determined to succeed. \"I am absolutely ready to go to law school,\" Mateo said.\n\nMoments earlier, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had released her and the other members of the Dream 9 from Eloy Detention Center in Arizona. The protesters get to return to their American communities until they can argue their case in court.\n\nThey take their name from the Dream Act, which would provide a path for immigrants like them who were brought to the United States illegally as children to live in the country legally.\n\n## Day In Court Years Away\n\nThe nine were transported by bus about 60 miles south to Tucson. Immigrant rights activists and news crews awaited them.\n\n\"You're here!\" someone shouted. Some of the freed activists and their supporters cried. The five women came off the bus first. They wore graduation caps and gowns, the same attire as when they were arrested last month while trying to cross from Mexico back into the United States. Next came the four men, dressed in street clothes.\n\nIt could take several years before any of them get their day in court, said the group's lawyer, Margo Cowan. They hope some sort of immigration relief will become law before then, she said.\n\nThe \"Dream 9\" staged a daring protest at the Nogales, Ariz., port of entry to draw attention to the more than 1 million people deported under the Obama administration. When they tried to re-enter the United States on July 22, they were arrested, and they had been in federal custody ever since.\n\nIn the detention center, which is like a jail, Mateo said she spoke to several people like her.\n\n\"I want the government to recognize that there is a group of people, Dreamers, who grew up in this country and belong here because these are their homes,\" Mateo said. \"They shouldn't have to go through what we went through. They should come home.\"\n\n## Odds Are Against Their Cases\n\nImmigration asylum officers decided this week that all nine had a reasonable fear of persecution or torture in their birth country, Mexico, and could therefore not be immediately deported. They received temporary parole into the United States.\n\nNow their cases go to an immigration judge. Experts say 98 percent of Mexican asylum cases are denied.\n\nMateo, Marco Saavedra of New York and Lulu Martinez of Chicago voluntarily crossed into Mexico before trying to re-enter the United States as an act of protest. The other six were attempting to return after leaving for Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.\n\nMaria Peniche, 22, left a year ago to live in Mexico City. She came to the United States legally when she was 10, she said, and overstayed her visa. In Boston, Peniche said, she worked three jobs to pay for college and grew frustrated that there was no immigration relief in sight.\n\nShe left three days before the Obama administration announced a deferred action program, which allows people who were brought into the country illegally as children to stay in the country, at least for two years.\n\nLife in Mexico was difficult, Peniche said; she was targeted because she'd lived so long in the United States. She was relieved to be free, and grateful to be back in the country, she said. \"It's amazing. I feel like I have so much freedom here. I can be myself and not be afraid,\" she said.\n\nMartinez, 23, was brought to the United States at age 3. She said she endured her time at Eloy by thinking of her family. \"Just being there waiting, I thought of ... coming home to my family,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The Senate Thursday voted 68-32 to make improvements to the nation's immigration system. The ambitious plan creates a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally while at the same time requiring stepped-up border security.\n\nThe measure represents the most sweeping changes to immigration law since the 1980s.  After sailing through the Senate, it now faces a tough path through the House of Representatives, where Republicans outnumber Democrats.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said flatly: \"The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes. We're going to do our own bill.\"\n\nThe bill's passage was no surprise. However, Senate leaders created some drama by making members vote from their seats, a practice reserved for only the most history-making occasions. One by one, senators rose from their seats to declare their votes. The Senate gallery was packed with observers looking on, including an entire section of college students and parents wearing bright blue \"United We Dream\" T-shirts.\n\n## Carefully Crafted Bill\n\nThe Senate vote showed strong support to the thousand-page bill carefully crafted by senators from both parties. Changes were put in this week to win more support from members who were not convinced. Fourteen Republicans joined 52 Democrats and two Independents in voting yes Thursday, while 32 Republicans voted no. The eight authors of the bill are called the \"Gang of Eight\" senators.\n\nThe debate stirred a lot of passion.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the spirit of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, who worked to enact immigration legislation before his death in 2009. \"Senator Kennedy knew the day would come when a group of senators divided by party, but united by love of country, would see this fight to the finish,\" Reid said as he closed the debate.\n\n\"That day is today. And while I am sad that Senator Kennedy isn't here to see history made, I know he is looking down on us proudly. He is not alone,\" Reid said.\n\n## E Pluribus Unum\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who played a major role in creating the bill, took heat from conservatives for his efforts to find common ground. Before he voted yes Thursday, he recalled his parents, who came to this country from Cuba.\n\n\"Well before they became citizens, in their hearts they had already become Americans,\" he said. \"It reminds us that sometimes we focus so much on how immigrants could change America, that we forget that America changes immigrants even more.\n\n\"This is not just my story,\" Rubio said. \"This is our story. It reminds us that we are 'E Pluribus Unum.' Out of many, one.\"\n\nThe bill requires employers to check on a job applicant's legal status. It would also raise the number of  skilled workers allowed to immigrate into the U.S. to fill jobs in the technology industry.\n\n## 11 Million Immigrants Affected\n\nThe measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants who came to the U.S. without permission. They would have to pass a background check, have not been convicted of a serious crime, pay any taxes owed and pay a $500 fine.\n\nIf all those factors are met, the immigrants would get a status that allows them to work and travel. They also would have to show they had been regularly employed and can support themselves financially.\n\nAfter 10 years, the status could again be adjusted. Immigrants would have to meet new requirements, including proficiency in English and a new $1,000 fine. Three years after that, in most cases, they could achieve citizenship.\n\nThere were demands that the path to citizenship be opened only if some border-security steps are taken. Those include towers, ground sensors, heat sensors, [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), Blackhawk helicopters and marine vessels. A 700-mile fence would be built between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nTwenty thousand additional Border Patrol agents would be added to the force of 18,400.\n\n## Responsibilities Of Citizenship\n\nOpponents said the plan basically pardons people who broke the law. They questioned whether the security goals were realistic.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who led the opposition, said the bill will not \"end the lawlessness in the future.\"\n\nOther Republicans had a different take. They tend to represent states with large and growing Hispanic populations, and they were going along with the political reality. They are concerned that an important voting block is slipping away after seeing their presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, win only about one-fourth of the Hispanic vote last year.\n\n\"If someone is going to be here in this country for 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 years, I want them to assimilate,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. \"I want them to have the rights, and more importantly, the responsibilities that come with citizenship.\"'"

            "title": "Indiana's religious-freedom law criticized, governor wants it clarified",
            "text": "\tINDIANAPOLIS - Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Tuesday that he wants a proposal for a law on his desk by the end of the week. He wants the state government to make it clear that a new Indiana law does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nPence defended the religious-freedom law as a vehicle to protect religious liberty. Still, he said he has been meeting with lawmakers \"around the clock\" to address concerns that it would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers.\n\nThe Republican  governor said he does not believe \"for a minute\" that lawmakers intended to let people discriminate under the law.\n\n\"It certainly wasn't my intent,\" said Pence. The governor signed the law last week.\n\nBut, he said, he understood that some people thought that was what the law meant. \"We need to confront that,\" Pence said.\n\n## \"FIX THIS NOW\"\n\nThe law prohibits the state from making other laws that make it difficult for a person to follow his or her religious beliefs. Religious institutions, businesses and associations are all considered \"persons\" under the law.\n\nThe legal language does not specifically mention gays and lesbians. However, critics say the law is designed to protect businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians. Examples include people such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a wedding for gay or lesbian couples.\n\nBusinesses and organizations including Apple and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) have voiced concern over the effect of the law. Some states will not let government money be used to pay for travel to Indiana.\n\nThe Indianapolis Star newspaper said Tuesday that the law needed to be changed.\n\nThe Star printed an opinion article written by its staff. It was headlined \"FIX THIS NOW.\" The editorial covered the newspaper's entire front page. It called for lawmakers to enact a law that would prohibit discrimination against people who are gay.\n\nThe newspaper says the uproar sparked by the law has \"done enormous harm\" to the state. It said the law could hurt business in the state in the future.\n\n## Protesters Fill Arkansas Capitol\n\nMeanwhile, Arkansas was poised to follow Indiana in enacting a similar law. The state was set to do this despite increasing criticism from businesses and gay-rights supporters.\n\nThe House of Arkansas' state government could vote as early as Tuesday on a proposal. The law would prohibit state and local governments from infringing on a person's religious beliefs without a \"compelling\" reason. Arkansas lawmakers also said they won't modify their measure.\n\n\"There's not really any place to make any changes now,\" Republican Representative Bob Ballinger of Hindsville, Arkansas, said about his proposal. \"If there are questions in two years, we can fix it.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters filled the Capitol in Arkansas to stand against the measure. They held signs that read \"Discrimination is not a Christian Value.\" Some signs read \"Discrimination is a Disease.\" They chanted \"Shame on you\" at Ballinger.\n\n\"I believe that many people will want to flee the state, and many people will want to avoid our state,\" said Rita Jernigan. She is a protester and one of the people suing the state over its ban on marriages between people of the same sex.\n\nSimilar proposals have been introduced in more than a dozen states. They are patterned after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. Nineteen other states have similar laws on the books.\n\n## Veto The Bill, Some Urge Governor\n\nArkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson had expressed reservations about unintended consequences of an earlier version of the bill. Since then, the Republican governor has said he will sign the current measure into law.\n\nIn a letter released Tuesday, Mark Stodola, the mayor of Little Rock, urged Hutchinson to veto the proposal. He said it would hurt the state's economic-development efforts because it \"sends the message that some members of our community will have fewer protections than others.\"\n\nOpponents of the bill hoped to target Hutchinson's promise to be a \"jobs governor\" made during his successful bid last year for the state's top office. The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's largest gay rights group and has run ads in Silicon Valley. The ads are aimed at the same technology firms Hutchinson has said he wants to lure to Arkansas.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook wrote in The Washington Post over the weekend opposing the Arkansas and Indiana measures. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has said the proposal sends the wrong message about its home state. Little Rock-based company Acxiom also urged Hutchinson to veto the bill, saying the measure would enable discrimination and open the state up to ridicule.\n\n\"This bill is at direct odds with your position that 'Arkansas is open for business,'\" CEO Scott Howe and Executive Vice President Jerry C. Jones said.\n\nIn Indiana, the reaction has included a planned women's conference in Indianapolis to be canceled this year. Meanwhile, the band Wilco has canceled a May performance.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - When Iran's president speaks at the annual gathering of the United Nations on Tuesday, Western diplomats might do something they have not done in six years - stick around and listen. Some may even applaud.\n\nFormer President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was known for his angry speeches. He denied the Holocaust happened. Hassan Rouhani was elected in June to replace him. He is more soft-spoken and is likely to give a conciliatory address to world leaders this week. It will be closely watched for signs that he is willing to thaw relations with the West.\n\nWestern diplomats predict that Rouhani's speech at the U.N. General Assembly will include an important gesture. He might even acknowledge that the Holocaust happened. U.S. officials would like to see him go further during his five-day visit. Maybe he could agree to direct talks with Washington. The leaders of the two countries have not spoken formally since Iraq's 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe White House says it has not scheduled a meeting between President Barack Obama and the 64-year-old Rouhani. But U.S. officials have hinted that Obama and other top officials are ready to chat with Rouhani or his U.S.-educated foreign minister. Such chats could open the way for bargaining on [Iran's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) disputed nuclear program.\n\n## Campaign Pledge To Ease Iran's Isolation\n\nThere are signs that Rouhani \"is somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States in a way that we haven't seen in the past,\" Obama said in an interview on Telemundo. \"So we should test it.\"\n\nObama has repeatedly signaled he is willing to talk with Rouhani. He even said so in an exchange of letters with Rouhani. The Iranian president was elected in June after a campaign that included pledges to ease his country's isolation and improve relations with the West.\n\nThe president is not the most powerful person in Iran. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is and he has long resisted compromise on the nuclear program. But punishments against Iran over the program have increasingly squeezed the economy. So he has signaled top-level support for the Rouhani mission.\n\nRouhani urged world leaders on Friday make the most of the opportunity \"and to respond genuinely to my government's efforts to engage in constructive dialogue.\" His comments appeared in an article in the Washington Post.\n\nAhmadinejad was often viewed as a carnival sideshow in his annual trips to New York. But VIPs and journalists are scrambling to get a close look at Rouhani. He has almost nonstop meetings planned during his trip.\n\n## Is Rouhani Open To Compromise?\n\nA Jewish Iranian legislator will join him on the trip. Rouhani used his Twitter account this month to send best wishes to Jews celebrating the Rosh Hashana holiday. It's unimaginable that Ahmadinejad would have done the same.\n\n\"After eight years of an erratic, unpredictable president who would say outlandish things, you have a normal person as the president of Iran,\" said Haleh Esfandiari, a former political prisoner under Ahmadinejad. Esfrandiari now is a Middle East scholar in Washington. \"He is centrist, he is a moderate, he tries to compromise.\"\n\nRouhani's appeal is apparent in the huge demand for tickets to a dinner he will have with several hundred Iranian-Americans in New York. It is even being called \"Rouhanimania.\"\n\nTwo years ago, the Iranian mission to the U.N. canceled a similar dinner with Ahmadinejad when too few people wanted to come.\n\nThe question remains: Is Rouhani simply presenting a more moderate face to the world? Or is he open to compromise to end the nuclear dispute?\n\nEven his detractors predict he will be charming and avoid picking fights. Although he is a true believer in the Islamic Revolution and a pillar of the Iranian national security apparatus, he is also realistic and intelligent. He speaks English well, having lived in Scotland in the 1990s as a Ph.D. candidate.\n\n## Rouhani: \"Turn Threats Into Opportunities\"\n\nIt was Rouhani who arranged the Iranian government's sympathetic reaction after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He also helped Washington reach out to opposition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which border Iran, after the U.S.-led invasions.\n\nRouhani has tried to appeal to the West without upsetting hard-liners at home.\n\nHe has proclaimed the \"age of blood feuds\" over, and said the United States and Iran can \"turn threats into opportunities.\" But he also has condemned U.S. \"military interference\" and insisted that Iran's nuclear program is a natural right that it will not surrender.\n\nAnalysts say Obama must be careful not to look too eager to make a deal. That would undermine his negotiating leverage and make influential members of Congress upset. It also would not sit well with the Israelis, who are counting on the United States to prevent Tehran from ever getting a nuclear bomb.\n\nBen Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday that U.S. officials weren't falling for pretty promises from the new Iranian leadership. \"Their words have to be followed by action,\" he said.\n\nAlthough the Iranians aren't expected to begin serious negotiations right away, media reports in Iran suggest they may have an immediate negotiating goal in mind. They apparently want punishments eased enough so that they could reconnect to the global clearinghouse for international financial payments called SWIFT. The connection would let Iran send money around the world for business.'"

            "title": "Gay couples in Ireland can now make it official",
            "text": "\tDUBLIN, Ireland - Gay couples woke up in Ireland Sunday morning and began planning their weddings.\n\nOn Saturday, the Irish people voted with a surprisingly strong 62 percent \"yes\" to change the constitution to allow gay couples to marry. Thousands of people celebrated until dawn after the results were announced.\n\n## New Law Will Make It Official\n\nThe Irish Justice Department announced that it plans to write a new bill - a proposed law - this week to allow gay marriages. The proposed law will permit those taking vows in civil ceremonies to choose to be \"husband and wife\" or \"spouses of each other.\" A civil wedding ceremony means that a couple is married by an official, instead of by a priest or a minister. The bill will make sure that gay couples do not have to get married in a church. This had been a key demand of the Catholic Church and other Christian and Muslim communities in Ireland. More than 80 percent of the Irish people are Catholic.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Joan Burton said she expects the bill to become law by early July. Because current law requires at least a three-month notice for any civil marriages, the first gay weddings cannot happen until autumn.\n\n## Delays Are Over\n\nFor Senator Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, their day has nearly come. Since 2003 the lesbian couple have fought to get the Irish government to recognize their Canadian marriage. They suffered setbacks and delays as they sued the government of Ireland all the way to its Supreme Court.\n\nZappone is from Seattle and settled with her Irish wife in Dublin 30 years ago. She said that for so long, she has had to dig in her heels and say, \"Well, we ARE married. I'm a married woman!\"\n\n\"We are now entering a new Ireland,\" said Gilligan, who is a former nun.\n\nOn Saturday, Zappone and Gilligan thrilled a crowd of thousands of people waving rainbow-colored flags as the vote results came in at Dublin Castle. Zappone was being interviewed on live TV when she dramatically stopped, stared directly into the camera, and asked Gilligan to marry her all over again.\n\n\"I said 'yes' to Katherine 12 years ago at our marriage in Canada,\" Gilligan shouted to the crowd. \"And now we are bringing the 'yes' back home to Ireland, our country of Ireland! Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n## Reflection Of A Long Road\n\nIn a more serious mood on Sunday, the couple reflected on their long road to being accepted as a gay couple. They also spoke of the remaining wait to be officially married in Ireland, hopefully before Christmas.\n\n\"It took us hours to get a taxi because so many people came up to us in tears, wanting to talk to us. They now felt so much freer, and proud,\" Zappone said. She became Ireland's first openly lesbian lawmaker when Ireland's prime minister appointed her to the Senate in 2011.\n\nGilligan said there are not many moments in life where a person is surrounded by so much joy. \"These are rare moments,\" said Gilligan, who decided in her mid-20s she no longer wanted to be a nun.\n\nIn 1981, Gilligan and Zappone met while taking a class at Boston College in the United States.\n\n\"I fell in love with Katherine, and I went for it. I simply adored her, and I wanted to be with her forever and ever, and here we are!\" Gilligan said.\n\n## Truth Be Told\n\nThey married in Vancouver, Canada, and went to court in Ireland to have their marriage recognized. In 2006, the Irish High Court ruled that marriage was between a man and a woman.\n\nSeveral years ago, Gilligan was in the hospital with bleeding in her brain. Zappone had problems trying to visit her, since the hospital did not recognize Zappone as a wife or other family member. She could have lied and said they had a civil partnership, which is a weaker form of marriage-style contract that is recognized in Ireland. Zappone insisted on the truth. \"I am married to her, and you have to recognize that,\" she told the hospital.\n\nThe medical staff understood and let her stay. After Zappone had spent five weeks at Gilligan's bedside, a doctor wrote them a long note saying he wished he had the kind of relationship they had.\n\nIreland's Constitution eventually will say that people of any sex can get married. First, parliament must pass the gay marriage bill. Experts say the bill will probably get through parliament easily, since all sides support it. Then Irish President Michael D. Higgins will sign the bill into law and amend the constitution.\n\n\"Technically and legally we'll probably have to wait until toward the end of the year\" to get married, Zappone said. \"Then we'll head toward the big day.\"'"

            "title": "Jeb Bush enters race for president, signals he's not a typical Republican",
            "text": "\tMIAMI, Fla. - Neither his father nor his brother was in the audience on Monday. Still, Jeb Bush joked about his connections to both men. He drew laughs when he said he met his first president the day he was born and the second the day he came home from the hospital.\n\nBush had come to Miami Dade College to formally announce his run for the White House. He soon turned serious, and made his point clearly and humbly: The presidency, he said, was something to be earned, not inherited.\n\n\"Not a one of us deserves the job\" because of seniority or family connections, the former Florida governor said.\n\n\"It's nobody's turn,\" Bush went on, in what also served as a poke at the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton. \"It's everybody's test, and it's wide open - exactly as a contest for president should be.\"\n\n## Family Connections Could Be A Hurdle\n\nJeb Bush is the son of former President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush. His family connections have made him the assumed Republican front-runner, yet they could work against him as well. Voters may resent him if they think he believes he deserves to be president simply because he is a Bush.\n\nThe official launch of Bush's candidacy was a mere formality after six months of heavy campaigning. Still, it served as a fresh start of sorts for a candidacy that has proved less than overwhelming. The event drew hours of television coverage and dozens of reporters to swampy south Florida. It was attended by his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, and his wife, children and other family members.\n\nThe launch was carefully designed to signal that Bush will be a new sort of Republican, even at age 62.\n\nIndeed, Bush's rally was no ordinary Republican gathering. The typical Republican voter is aging, white and rural. On Monday, Latin music pulsed outside the college gymnasium where the announcement was made. English, Spanish and several other languages mingled together at the event.\n\n## He Hopes To Attract New Voters To The Party\n\nMany people think that to continue to do well politically the Republican Party will have to attract new voters, because the party's traditional white, rural base is shrinking. Jeb Bush hopes to be able to do just that.\n\nOn Monday, Bush delivered the message he hopes will serve him through the long, grinding campaign. It featured can-do confidence and a highly flattering recitation of his record as governor.\n\nBush also took turns criticizing the administration of President Barack Obama and swatting at his Republican rivals. He suggested that his time as governor had prepared him to serve as president. \"Executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that,\" he said.\n\n## Much Of His Message Sounds Traditional\n\nYet for all the newness he sought to project and despite the many young people in the audience, much of Bush's message was traditionally Republican. It included calls for lower taxes, less regulation and more limited government. His promise to banish the special interests and \"shake up the culture of Washington\" is standard for candidates of both parties.\n\nBush laid out an ambitious goal of 4 percent annual growth for each year he is president. The result, he said, would be 19 million new jobs.\n\nBush, who started in Florida politics in the early 1980s, had been mentioned as a presidential prospect for years. Still, he surprised many in December when he finally expressed interest in running.\n\nPerhaps more surprising, though, has been his somewhat poor performance since.\n\n## Bush Faces A Crowded Republican Field\n\nFar from being the commanding front-runner, Bush has failed to break free of a large and growing field of Republican rivals. More than a dozen hopefuls have declared their candidacy or are weighing a White House bid.\n\nEven Marco Rubio, Florida's junior senator, declined to stand aside for Bush, who helped guide Rubio early in his political career.\n\nBush last ran for office more than a dozen years ago. His political rustiness has shown, most notably when he fumbled an easily foreseen question about whether he backed the unpopular war his brother launched in Iraq. Bush finally said that, given what is known today, he would not have supported the war.\n\nBush is also out of step with the Republican Party overall. The party has grown much more conservative - more attached to traditional ideas - since he last ran for office. Many Republicans may see him as not conservative enough and too much like a Democrat.\n\nOn Monday, Bush suggested that to win the presidency he would bring the Republican Party to his way of thinking, not the other way around. If he succeeds, that in itself would be a historic achievement.'"

            "title": "Pope Francis says Spanish priest is ready for sainthood",
            "text": "\tPope Francis announced Thursday that Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who helped spread Christianity in California in the 1700s, will become a saint in September.\n\nSerra is a controversial figure. Some see him as a dedicated servant of God, while others blame him for harsh treatment of the Native Americans in California under Spanish rule.\n\nAs the time Serra lived, the Spanish controlled California, building missions, forts and ranches. Serra was a religious leader who helped build the first missions there, which were used to spread Christianity and convert Native Americans.\n\n\"He was the evangelizer of the West in the United States,\" the pope told reporters. The pope made his announcement while traveling from Sri Lanka, where he declared, or canonized, that country's first saint.\n\n## Believe In Miracles\n\nFor Catholics and some other Christian groups, a saint is a holy figure, someone who lived a good life that can be an example to others.\n\nThe ceremony to officially declare Serra a saint, his canonization, may bring the pope to California during his scheduled trip to the United States this fall.\n\nTo become a saint, the Catholic Church usually must decide that someone has performed at least two miracles. Serra has performed just one, according to the church - prayers to him cured a nun of a serious disease in St. Louis. Still, Serra is a holy man who has been honored as a saint for centuries, Pope Francis explained.\n\nBecoming a saint in the Roman Catholic Church is a long process with several steps. Serra passed the third when he was beatified in 1986.\n\n## Pope's Decision Disappoints Some\n\nNative American groups have strongly opposed Serra's road to sainthood, saying the native Californians who built the missions were forced to work and often punished harshly.\n\nMany Native Americans put to work by the Spanish died of European diseases, including chicken pox and measles, because they had never been exposed to them before.\n\nValentin Lopez is one Native American activist who is disappointed by the pope's decision. He is chairman of the Amah-Mutsun Tribal Band of Coastanoan/Ohlone Indians. Lopez hopes the Vatican, the headquarters of the Catholic church in Rome, will re-think Serra's sainthood.\n\n\"Pope Francis is from Argentina and knows the history of the New World,\" Lopez said. \"But maybe he thinks it's more important that he brought Christianity to the New World than what happened to the native population. Maybe the end justifies the means.\"\n\n## Stopped Cold\n\nElias Castillo recently wrote a book about the Spanish and Native Americans in California: \"A Cross of Thorns: The Enslavement of California's Indians by the Spanish Missions.\"\n\nHe says Californians are living a \"horrible lie\" in their opinions of the Spanish priest. Serra's statue stands at all of California's 21 missions as well as at the state Capitol building.\n\n\"I'm astounded. I couldn't believe the pope was doing this. There was an attempt to canonize him in the '40s and '50s, and that was stopped cold by the Indians. I think there will be protests,\" Castillo said.\n\nHe said it is outrageous that the Catholic Church, which has apologized for how the Indians were treated, would now \"canonize one of their great monsters.\"\n\nBut a member of the Ohlone tribe, Andrew Galvan, said he is quite happy to hear of Serra's upcoming sainthood.\n\n\"I'm ecstatic,\" said Galvan, who is the curator of Mission Dolores in San Francisco and whose ancestors were baptized at the missions.\n\nGalvan admits Native Americans at the missions were treated poorly, but he does not blame Serra. He blames colonialism. During the colonial period, the Spanish and other Europeans came to the New World to take natural resources, like gold and silver. They took over the land and used the local people to help them get what they wanted.\n\n\"You can't change the past, and we all acknowledge mistakes were made in the past,\" Galvan said. \"The bottom line is I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism.\"\n\n## The Controversy Has Calmed\n\nPope Francis's announcement surprised many who thought the Native American groups' opposition might delay Serra's sainthood forever.\n\nRobert Senkewicz is a history professor at Santa Clara University, which was founded by Serra in 1777. He believes the controversy calmed down since Serra's beatification in the 1980s.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, the lines were really tightly drawn between people who supported Serra's beatification and people who didn't. It was very intense,\" said Senkewicz, who co-wrote a biography on Serra.\n\nSo what will Serra's legacy be? Will he be known for the poor treatment of Native Americans or for his role as a Catholic missionary spreading the faith in a new land?\n\n\"St. Francis of Assisi was known for nature. St. Thomas Aquinas for intellectual scholarship. Mother Seton in the U.S. is known for devotion to the poor,\" Senkewicz said. \"The niche of Serra is giving up a very, very prosperous life in Spain for a difficult missionary life.\"\n\n## The Road To Sainthood\n\nMaking Junipero Serra a saint brings up another question: will he be considered California's first saint or an American saint?\n\nSerra was born in Spain, but did much of his work in California, building the first nine missions there, and he died in 1784 at the Carmel Mission. At the time, California was not a U.S. state, but was ruled by Spain.\n\nThere are more than 10,000 saints. Only 12 were either born in the United States or did their good works here. There is another Californian on the road to sainthood: Cora Evans, a dedicated Catholic who lived quietly in the Santa Cruz Mountains and died in 1957. She was declared a \"servant of God\" by the Vatican in 2012, one important step to sainthood.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - Abraham Lincoln was killed by John Wilkes Booth 150 years ago on April 14. Since then, views of his presidency have changed.\n\nAs recent events have shown, some of the problems Lincoln faced in his fight to end slavery are still with us. They remain a part of today's struggles over equality and race.\n\nAs the anniversary of his death approached, historians and moviemakers took a fresh look at Lincoln's words and actions.\n\n## Lincoln, Obama Wrestle With Same Troubles\n\nMany of the issues Lincoln grappled with remain as troubling today as they were in his time. Recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, and in North Charleston, South Carolina, demonstrate that the country is still plagued by some of the same racial divisions Lincoln confronted in 1865. In both cities, a white police officer shot an unarmed black man to death.\n\nThe election of Barack Obama was supposed to mark an end to many of the country's racial problems. However, some of the same issues that confronted Lincoln have been revisited during Obama's presidency.\n\n\"All generations rethink Lincoln,\" historian Martha Hodes said. \"For this generation, it's about rethinking the meaning of freedom in a moment that is decidedly not the post-racial moment some expected with the election and re-election of the nation's first black president.\"\n\n## Voting Rights For All\n\nThe anniversary of Lincoln's assassination will be commemorated in various locations. Ceremonies are planned at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, and at Ford's Theater and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n\nHodes said memories of Lincoln are linked to painful current events and to \"renewed calls for justice.\"\n\nOther historians agree, pointing to ongoing political fights over voting rights. Some feel that politicians have used legal tricks to reduce the number of blacks who are able to vote. In his time, Lincoln had to deal with strong resistance to giving blacks equal voting rights.\n\nLincoln was not murdered because he freed the slaves, historian Michael Burlingame said. He was killed \"because on April 11, 1865, he publicly called for black voting rights.\"\n\nBooth was in the audience for that speech, and vowed then to kill Lincoln, said Burlingame.\n\n## Historians Had Questions\n\nLincoln should be honored as someone who died in the pursuit of civil rights, Burlingame said. He should be thought of alongside Martin Luther King, Medgar Evers and others who were assassinated for fighting for racial justice.\n\nLincoln has not always been seen positively, however.\n\nLincoln was viewed extremely favorably during the 1950s. However, in the years that followed \"a big change took place,\" historian Richard Wightman Fox said.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, historians began to question whether Lincoln really cared that much about ending slavery. Perhaps, they said, he had other reasons for wanting to fight against the slave-owning South. Some scholars argued that the Civil War between North and South was really more about money or controlling the country than slaves.\n\n\"Opinion about him became entirely less favorable,\" Fox said.\n\n## Unfulfilled Promises\n\nAfrican-Americans first began to turn away from Lincoln during the Great Depression of the 1930s, historian Edna Greene Medford said. Many people were out of work during those years, and things were particularly hard for blacks.\n\nLincoln suddenly became a symbol of disappointment and unfulfilled promise for many African-Americans.\n\n\"These former slaves recalled what life was supposed to be and what it was not,\" Medford said. \"They were saying, 'Lincoln freed us, but he didn't give us anything but our freedom. We needed land, we needed more opportunity.'\"\n\nHowever, the connection with Lincoln \"never totally dies out,\" Medford said. In 1963, King delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. King talked about liberation and \"how people are still suffering\" in ways that recalled Lincoln, Medford said.\n\n## Lincoln Struggled With War\n\nToday, many black Americans \"understand the complexity of the man,\" Medford said. They \"are understanding more what Lincoln was about, why he did what he did\" as a leader in a more openly racist time in American history.\n\nNewly examined letters show that Lincoln was very concerned about the suffering the Civil War caused. James Cornelius, of the Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, said that the president wrote many letters to families of soldiers during the Civil War. They reveal that he \"cared deeply, individually, about each man he sent off to war, and possible death.\"\n\nThe letters reflect Lincoln's \"understanding of his duty as commander in chief to every soldier,\" Cornelius said.'"

            "text": "\tISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Pakistan freed eight of the 10 men accused in the shooting of teenage Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.\n\nThe eight men were found innocent, but Pakistani officials kept that fact secret. The officials chose not to clear up confusion caused by incorrect news reports in April that all of them were sent to prison. It was likely that the officials wanted to get credit for catching the men who attacked the teen activist.\n\nAt the time, it had been widely reported that all 10 men had been convicted by an anti-terrorist court.\n\n## British Newspaper Digs Up Facts\n\nThe eight acquittals were revealed Friday by the popular British newspaper The Mirror. Its reporters looked for the 10 men in prisons across Pakistan and only found two.\n\nSaeed Naeem, the public lawyer for Malala's native Swat region, said he had not corrected the mistaken reporting. He said it was not his responsibility and no one told him to do so.\n\nHe said the two men convicted - identified only as Izhar and Israrullah - have each been sentenced to 46 years in prison for the attack on Malala. The gunman, Ataullah Khan, is one of four who have not been captured yet.\n\nNaeem said the not-guilty verdicts against the eight suspects had been appealed to the high court in Peshawar.\n\n## The Missing Court Files\n\nHowever, human rights lawyers in Malala's hometown, Mingora, said the case against the 10 accused attackers was full of problems.\n\n\"This is totally beyond comprehension,\" said Sher Mohammed Khan, a Swat-based lawyer and representative of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\n\nHe said there are no court files for any of the men.\n\n\"Nobody knows who they are, how their trial was conducted,\" who appeared in court and which lawyers represented the 10 accused men, Khan said. \"It's a classic example of denial of free trial.\"\n\nThe discovery that eight of the men were freed also raised suspicions about the timing of the September 2014 arrests. The arrests came just a month before Malala was given the Nobel Peace Prize. The prize is awarded to people or groups that have contributed to making the world a more peaceful place.\n\nShe shared it with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarti.\n\nPrior to that, Malala had been widely viewed with mistrust in Pakistan.\n\nPublic skepticism about Malala began to lessen only last September, when the military announced it had caught her attackers.\n\n## First Author, Then Activist\n\nMalala first emerged as a celebrity in 2009 after admitting to being \"Gul Makai.\" That was the pen name of the author of a diary about life under Taliban rule. The violent group has been fighting the government for control of the country and holds power in some parts of Pakistan. Malala's diary was broadcast by the BBC in Britain and she became famous around the world.\n\nAt just 11, Malala highlighted how the Taliban prevented girls from getting an education. She became the first Pakistani activist to defy the Taliban, who believe woman and girls are inferior.\n\nFor her activism, terror chief Mullah Fazlullah, also from Swat, ordered her killing.\n\n## Worldwide Effort To Save Her\n\nMalala was shot in the head and neck by a Taliban killer in October 2012. She was seated in a van parked outside her school in Mingora.\n\nTwo other teenage girls, Kainat Riaz and Shazia Rehman, were injured in the attack.\n\nMalala survived because of a global effort to save her life.\n\nShe was flown to Britain for medical care in a United Arab Emirates government airplane. There, she underwent surgeries to restore her eyesight and hearing.\n\nAfter recovering, Malala won admirers worldwide by resuming her campaign for a child's right to education.\n\nThe Taliban \"thought the bullet would silence us, but they failed,\" she told the United Nations General Assembly in July 2013.'"

            "text": "\tROZSYPNE, Ukraine - World leaders called for an immediate cease-fire in eastern Ukraine on Friday. The call came a day after a Malaysia Airlines jetliner was shot down over the country's battlefields. Global leaders demanded that international investigators be allowed to reach the crash site.\n\nThe strong words came as search teams combed the area near the Russian border for pieces of wreckage from the Boeing 777.\n\nThe attack Thursday afternoon killed 298 people from nearly a dozen nations. Among the dead were vacationers, students and a large group of scientists heading to an AIDS conference in Australia.\n\nPresident Barack Obama called for an immediate cease-fire between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia separatists. He also called for a trustworthy investigation.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out,\" Obama said at the White House.\n\n## Surface-To-Air Missile Attack\n\nU.S. intelligence authorities said a surface-to-air missile brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 as it traveled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Friday the missile was likely fired from a rebel-held area near the Russian border.\n\nThe Ukrainian government is fighting pro-Russian rebels who are trying to separate from Ukraine. Many consider themselves ethnically Russian and speak Russian. Ukraine accuses Russia of supporting these rebels. Russia, Ukraine and the rebels all denied shooting the plane down. Moscow also denies backing the rebels.\n\nThe rebels began fighting after Russia in March invaded and took the Crimean Peninsula away from Ukraine. Crimea has with many Russians. The takeover led to the fighting now.\n\nAfter holding an emergency session, the U.N. Security Council called for \"a full, thorough and independent international investigation\" into the downing of the plane.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said both sides in the conflict should put down their weapons and hold peace talks. On Thursday, Putin blamed Ukraine for the crash. He said Ukraine's government was responsible for the unrest in its eastern regions. However, he didn't accuse Ukraine of shooting the plane down. Putin also didn't address whether Russia gave the rebels such a powerful missile.\n\n## Ukraine Releases Video\n\nThe Ukrainian government released a video supposedly showing a truck carrying a Buk missile launcher it said was used to fire on the plane. One of its four missiles was apparently missing. Ukraine said the footage was filmed by a police squad Friday as the truck was heading toward the Russian border.\n\nThere was no way to prove the accuracy of the video.\n\nReaching the sprawling crash site remained difficult and dangerous. The road into it from Donetsk, the largest city in the region, was marked by five rebel checkpoints.\n\nA commission of around 30 European officials traveled to the crash site Friday afternoon.\n\n\"No black boxes have been found ... we hope that experts will track them down and create a picture of what has happened,\" Donetsk separatist leader Aleksandr Borodai said.\n\nYet earlier Friday, a member of Borodai's group said eight out of 12 recording devices had been recovered. It was not clear what he was referring to. Planes usually have two black boxes - one for recording flight information and the other for recording voices in the cockpit.\n\n## Charred Wreckage Amid Sunflowers\n\nThe crash site was spread out over fields between two villages in eastern Ukraine - Rozsypne and Hrabove. In the distance, the thud of Grad missile launchers being fired could be heard Friday morning.\n\nIn the sunflower fields around Rozsypne, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Russian border, lines of men searched for remains. One fainted after finding a body. Another body was covered in a coat.\n\nAbout 70 off-duty coal miners joined the search, their faces still sooty from work.\n\nIn Hrabove, several miles away, sticks with red or white rags attached marked where body parts were found.\n\nAndrei Purgin, a leader of the pro-Russian separatists, said the bodies were to be taken to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Mariupol.\n\nSmashed watches and mobile phones, charred boarding passes and passports were among the wreckage.\n\nLarge chunks of the plane were scattered over one field. The cockpit and one turbine lay a kilometer (a half-mile) apart. The tail landed 10 kilometers (6 miles) away. One rebel militiaman in Rozsypne told the AP the plane's body showed signs of being struck by a missile.\n\n## Airlines Now Avoiding Parts Of Ukraine Airspace\n\nThe area has seen heavy fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists. Rebels had bragged about shooting down two Ukrainian military jets Wednesday.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed Ukraine's claim that Moscow could be behind the attack.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk described the attack as an \"international crime.\" He called on those behind it to be punished in an international court.\n\nMalaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lay insisted again Friday that the airline's path was an internationally approved route. He denied claims the airline was trying to save fuel and money by taking a more direct flight path across Ukraine.\n\nAviation authorities in several countries, including the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, had issued previous warnings not to fly over parts of Ukraine. Within hours of the crash Thursday, several airlines announced they were avoiding parts of Ukrainian airspace.'"

            "text": "\tJOHANNESBURG - Nelson Mandela, one of the world's most beloved leaders and a hero of the 20th century, died on Thursday, Dec. 5. He was 95.\n\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma made the announcement at a news conference late on Thursday. \"We've lost our greatest son,\" he said.\n\nMandela was most known for his fight to end apartheid, a system that forced non-white South Africans to live separately and with fewer rights.\n\nAs South Africa's first black president, he used well-chosen gestures of forgiveness to build a bridge between whites and blacks. He even had lunch with the government lawyer who sent him to jail.\n\n## A Symbol Of Freedom\n\nMandela had been convicted of treason and sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for leading a campaign of sabotage against the government. From there, he was sent to one of the country's worst prisons on Robben Island. While Mandela was in prison, it was forbidden to quote him or publish his photo. But he was able to sneak out messages to help others fight against the apartheid system.\n\nThousands died, were tortured and were imprisoned in the long struggle against apartheid. When Mandela emerged from prison in 1990, smiling and waving to the crowds, the image became an international symbol of freedom.\n\nSouth Africa's white rulers had portrayed Mandela as a revolutionary who would take away property from private owners. They said black rule would lead to the same chaos and bloodshed that had happened elsewhere on the continent.\n\nYet since apartheid ended, South Africa has had three peaceful presidential elections. The country has set an example for the rest of Africa, where democracy is still new and easily broken.\n\nNelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born July 18, 1918, the son of a tribal chief. Growing up at a time when nearly all of Africa was under European rule, Mandela attended Methodist schools. After that, he went to a university for black students in 1938. He was expelled two years later for taking part in a student strike.\n\n## Spear Of The Nation\n\nMandela moved to Johannesburg and worked as a policeman at a gold mine, boxed as an amateur heavyweight, and studied law. He married and had four children.\n\nHe first became a leader in the fight against apartheid in 1944, when he helped form the African National Congress (ANC) Youth League.\n\nHe organized a campaign in 1952 to encourage people to disobey laws that segregated schools, marriage, housing and jobs. The government got back at him by barring him from going to gatherings and leaving Johannesburg.\n\nAfter a two-day nationwide strike was crushed by police, Mandela pushed to form Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation. It was a more militia-like wing of the anti-apartheid movement.\n\nIn 1962 he was arrested for leaving the country illegally and inciting blacks to strike. He was sentenced to five years of hard labor\n\nA year later, police uncovered the ANC's underground headquarters on a farm and found documents outlining plans for an attack. Mandela and seven others were sentenced to life in prison.\n\n\"I do not deny that I planned sabotage,\" he told the court. \"I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by whites.\"\n\n## Elected President By A Landslide\n\nFrom the late 1960s, other countries gradually began to shun South Africa. It was expelled from the U.N. and banned from the Olympics. In 1973 the government offered to release Mandela on condition he agree to stay in his native land of Transkei. He refused. In 1982 he and other top ANC prisoners were moved off Robben Island to a mainland prison. Three years later, Mandela was again offered freedom, and again he refused unless segregation laws were scrapped and the government negotiated with the ANC.\n\nIn 1989, F.W. de Klerk became president. The white leader recognized the end was near for white-ruled South Africa.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 1990, Mandela, who had once been refused permission to leave prison for his mother's funeral, went free and walked hand-in-hand with Winnie, his wife. Blacks across the country erupted in joy - as did many whites.\n\nMandela took charge of the ANC. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk in 1993. In the following year, he was elected president by a landslide in South Africa's first all-race election.\n\nHe and the Archbishop Desmond Tutu set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Commission allowed people of all races who had violated human rights to admit their crimes publicly in return for a lighter punishment. It turned out to be a form of national therapy. Other countries coming out of long conflicts followed South Africa's example and set up similar commissions.\n\nMandela increasingly left Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in charge. Mbeki became president after Mandela's term ended in June 1999. Mandela did not run for another term, which is rare for African presidents.\n\n\"I must step down while there are one or two people who admire me,\" Mandela joked at the time.'"

            "title": "Manning acquitted of most serious charge of aiding the enemy",
            "text": "\tU.S. Army Private Bradley Manning was found not guilty of aiding the enemy on Tuesday, the most serious charge he faced for leaking secret documents. The case sparked a debate over military security versus the public's right to know.\n\nA military judge convicted Manning, 25, of most of the other charges against him, including spying and theft.\n\nManning was accused of the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history for delivering more than 700,00 pages of documents and videos to the Web site WikiLeaks.\n\nManning has been in jail for three years. He already admitted to other charges. The charges he was convicted of carry smaller sentences that could still add up to as much as roughly 130 years in prison, news organizations said.\\n## Sentencing In Trial Begins Wednesday\n\nOn Twitter, WikiLeaks called the possible sentence: \"Dangerous national security extremism from the Obama administration.\"\n\nThe judge, Colonel Denise Lind, will determine Mannings' sentence on those crimes during a second phase of the military trial, or court martial. But the aiding the enemy charge could have landed Manning in prison for life without a chance of parole. That charge has not been used since the Civil War, the Washington Post said.\n\nLind did not explain the reasoning behind her decision. She said she would release detailed written findings, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe process to determine Manning's punishment will begin Wednesday at Fort Meade, Maryland.\n\nThe military prosecutors, who made the case against him,  said that Manning is a \"traitor\" for sending the documents to the anti-secrecy Web site. Some of the information wound up in the hands of al-Qaida, prosecutors argued. Manning had access to the documents when he was a junior intelligence officer in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThe documents included information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Messages to and from U.S. diplomats  were also leaked. The Web site also showed combat videos from an army helicopter gunship. A Reuters TV news cameraman and his driver were killed during the shooting that was shown. So were other people.\\n## Manning Wanted Public Debate On Wars\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Army Maj. Ashden Fein, said that the documents Manning released could give the enemy a \"playbook\" of U.S. fighting secrets. Prosecutors also said that Manning wanted to be famous. They said that he did not care what the leaks would mean to U.S. security or his fellow soldiers.\n\nThe defense argued that Manning could have gotten a hold of much more information than he gave to WikiLeaks. He only disclosed some information. He wanted to get a debate going about U.S. war policies, his lawyers said.\n\n\"I believed if the public was aware of the data, it would start a public debate of the wars,\" Manning said during his trial, according to media reports.\n\nSome Manning supporters showed up outside Fort Meade, carrying signs and banners. One banner read: \"Stop the Wars Expose the Lies Free Bradley Manning,\" a Reuters video showed.\n\nOne of Manning's lawyers, David Coombs, briefly spoke to the supporters.\n\n\"We won the battle, now we need to go win the war,\" Coombs said of the sentencing phase, The Associated Press reported. \"Today is a good day, but Bradley is by no means out of the fire.\"\\n## Faces Decades In Prison\n\nReporters, lawyers and civil liberties experts have been watching the case closely. They want to see how it could affect others who might leak state secrets in the United States.\n\nSome people were concerned that a guilty decision on the aiding the enemy charge could scare other people who wanted to leak military secrets.\n\nEven the \"not guilty\" verdict on that charge offered only limited relief.\n\nEven though there was no \"evidence that he intended any harm to the United States, Manning faces decades in prison,\" said Elizabeth Goitein, a security expert at New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice. That sets a very scary example for anyone else, she added.\n\nThe U.S. government is currently involved in another high-profile leak case.\n\nNational Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden recently revealed efforts by the NSA to monitor the cellphone and Internet traffic of U.S. citizens. Snowden is currently stuck in a Russian airport. He is  trying to get to another country to avoid facing U.S. criminal charges.\\n## WikiLeaks In Spotlight\n\nThe Guardian newspaper, one of the main news sources that received Snowden's leaks, reported that Snowden said that one of the reasons he fled the country was the way Manning was treated by the military.\n\nWikiLeaks has never publicly admitted that Manning was the source of the documents it released on the Afghanistan war in 2010. The huge document disclosure made a household name out of WikiLeaks and brought the international spotlight on its founder, Julian Assange.\n\n\"We call those types of people that are willing to risk ... being a martyr for all the rest of us, we call those people heroes,\" Assange told CNN this week. \"Bradley Manning is a hero.\"'"

            "title": "L.A. mayor's Spanish woos Mexican media",
            "text": "\tMEXICO CITY - Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, recently made an official visit to the Mexican capital, making him the second Spanish-speaking LA mayor in a row to do so.\n\nGarcetti, like the past mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, speaks a version of the language that might be called Funky American Business Spanish for lack of a more scientific term.\n\nVillaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots, but both had to learn much of their Spanish in school or on the job. They speak a serviceable but far from perfect Spanish, a shortcoming each has acknowledged with good humor. During a 2009 visit to Mexico City, Villaraigosa referred to himself jokingly as \"el pochito\". \"Pocho\" is slang for an Americanized Mexican who may not speak Spanish well.\n\nOn Tuesday, Garcetti referred to his language skills as \"good community meeting Spanish.\" He said much of it was refined while he was representing LA's heavily Spanish-speaking 13th City Council District. Garcetti's grandfather on his father's side was born in Mexico.\n\n## Invents \"Agrecimiento\"\n\nIt so happened that the Mexican media was just as eager as his hometown voters to chat him up. They were fascinated by the new LA mayor with Mexican roots and an Italian name.\n\n\"Yesterday I think I did 15 individual interviews\" in Spanish, Garcetti said in an interview Tuesday morning. \"At the end of the day, your head kind of hurts. But the next day, you're speaking it again, and it hurts a little less.\"\n\nGarcetti's Spanish probably served him well Tuesday afternoon in a closed-door meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Pena Nieto was criticized by some during his 2012 campaign for speaking limited English.\n\nAt a news conference Monday at the Industrial Club of Mexico, the mayor was able to answer questions in Spanish. He held forth on the two cities' shared challenges and his mixed Jewish-Latino background. His answers were also peppered with the kinds of little mistakes that his 11th-grade Spanish teacher would have marked, lightly, in red pen.\n\nAt one point, he appeared to have invented a word: \"agrecimiento,\" to mean \"acuerdo,\" or \"agreement.\" Moments later, he stuck the English word \"between\" in the middle of a Spanish sentence. Later, making a reference to the \"social fabric,\" Garcetti said what sounded like the \"fabrica social\" (in Spanish, \"el tejido social\"), which could be translated as \"the social manufacturing plant.\"\n\n## Appreciating The Effort\n\nIf Garcetti had been speaking French on a diplomatic mission to Paris, he might have been yelled at for his errors, some say jokingly. But Mexicans tend not to be such purists. They have also built up years of tolerance for visitors from El Norte mangling their mother tongue.\n\n\"There's no gotcha involved here,\" Gil Cedillo, an LA City Councilman who is traveling with the mayor on the four-day trip, said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nCedillo should know: Although he grew up in Boyle Heights with Spanish-speaking parents, he said he started speaking the language seriously only after 1998, when he was elected to the California State Assembly and promised local Spanish-speaking media that he'd improve. Soon after, he said, he went to Cuernavaca for a two-week Spanish immersion crash course.\n\nHis parents, like many Latino parents at the time, saw the widespread prejudice against Spanish speakers. They decided it best that their son join the English speakers.\n\n\"I know I'm limited,\" he said. \"I know my grammar is not correct. But I know people here appreciate the effort.\"\n\nGarcetti used Spanish often during last year's mayoral race. He emphasized his Mexican background even as some well-known local Latino leaders rallied behind his opponent. At least one of them questioned Garcetti's Latino roots. The tactic probably helped him carry most of the heavily Latino neighborhoods on LA's Eastside in the May election.\n\n## \"OK, I'll Say It In English\"\n\nBuilding favor with Mexico on the business front also makes good sense. According to Garcetti's office, Mexico is the LA metropolitan area's second-largest export market. Trade between Los Angeles and the Mexican capital alone was $2.2 billion in 2010. And the largest number of foreign tourists to LA are from Mexico.\n\nThe mayor arrived in Mexico City on Sunday, where he was joined by a group of LA city officials. A number of area business leaders came along and paid their own way.\n\nOn Monday, Garcetti visited the National University of Mexico. He praised its plans to partner with Cal State Northridge in creating a new Center for Mexico and Latin American Studies at the California school. On Wednesday, he was scheduled to open a new exchange program between Loyola Marymount University and the Technological Institute of Mexico.\n\nGarcetti spoke at a news conference about the importance of \"cultural fluency\" in the new global economy. \"Mas y mas, este es una oportunidad de cruzar las fronteras,\" he said. More and more, this is an opportunity to cross borders. \"Directamente, y, um, ah...\"\n\n\"Say it in English,\" Isaac Ajzen, a reporter for diariojudio.com, suggested in English, with a chuckle.\n\n\"OK, I'll say it in English,\" Garcetti said. \"You can cross the borders literally and conceptually.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - The Supreme Court ruling giving gays and lesbians the right to marry marked a huge shift in law and public attitudes. It also created the most important new constitutional liberty in many years.\n\nFriday's 5-4 decision focused on the question of same-sex marriage. However, its meaning goes far beyond the battle for marriage equality. The ruling will almost surely lead to the end of any remaining laws that discriminate against gay people.\n\nThe court's ruling was cheered by some as a long overdue recognition of the basic human right to get married. Others, however, condemned it. They called it an effort by liberal justices to take over a matter that should be decided by state lawmakers.\n\nThe decision lets gay and lesbian couples marry in the 13 states that still banned gay marriage.\n\n## Justice Says It's About Equal Respect, Dignity\n\nThe Supreme Court's justices are generally thought to be divided into two groups - liberals and conservatives - who tend to vote the same way. Each group can claim four justices, while Justice Anthony M. Kennedy more or less takes the middle ground.\n\n\"No longer may this liberty be denied to them,\" Justice Kennedy wrote. \"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.\"\n\nSame-sex couples, he wrote, \"ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\"\n\nKennedy declared that gays and lesbians deserve equal respect and dignity under the Constitution.\n\nKennedy described the struggle for gay marriage as a matter of equal rights. He based it on a 1967 decision that struck down laws that prevented African-Americans and white people from marrying. He also based it on rulings from the 1970s that ended laws that gave husbands greater rights than their wives.\n\n## Court's Dissenters Heaped Scorn\n\nThe court's decision will likely encourage more people to accept same-sex marriage. A majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage, which was not the case just a few years ago.\n\nKennedy said that some parts of the country may not be ready to accept equality for gays and lesbians. \"The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times,\" he wrote.\n\nThe four Supreme Court judges who voted against the decision heaped scorn on the majority opinion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts said that the court is not a legislature, like Congress, and should not make law. He also said that the Constitution does not decide on issues of marriage.\n\nRoberts' opinion outlined why he thought the matter should be decided by lawmakers.\n\nHe called the court's decision an \"act of will, not legal judgment.\"\n\n## \"Victory For America\"\n\nAmid rainbow flags and joyous celebrations on the Supreme Court steps, James Obergefell took a congratulatory phone call from President Barack Obama. Obergefell brought the case to the Supreme Court. He had sued the state of Ohio for refusing to recognize his marriage after his husband, John Arthur, died.\n\nObama applauded the ruling, calling it a \"victory for America.\"\n\nHe praised the persistence of same-sex marriage supporters. \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\"\n\nAllowing gay couples to marry would strengthen communities, the president said.\n\nObama added, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: that when all Americans are treated as equal, all are free.\"\n\n## Ruling Was A Matter Of Time\n\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined with Kennedy to vote for gay marriage. Justices Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Roberts to vote against it.\n\nThe ruling came as no surprise. Federal judges, state courts, lawmakers and voters had already knocked down the legal barriers to gay marriages in 37 states.\n\nSupport for gay marriage picked up steam two years ago when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned gay marriage. The court said that marriages of same-sex couples deserved equal dignity and respect under the law.\n\nFriday's decision addressed only the question of same-sex marriage. The ruling, though, may have far-reaching effects by sending a message that laws against gays and lesbians are on shaky ground.\n\nSarah Warbelow is a lawyer for the Human Rights Campaign in Washington. She said the Supreme Court ruling will help gay-rights supporters fight against any new laws that would target gay people. There are currently more than 115 bills, or proposed laws, being considered in state legislatures that would target gay people.\n\nWarbelow and others would have liked Kennedy and the court to have gone even further. They wanted him to put discrimination against gay people on the same level as discrimination against racial minorities or women.\n\n\"That would have made it crystal clear that there are virtually no circumstances under which the government can discriminate against gays,\" Warbelow said.'"

To save the day, players must do all of the usual video game stunts, like travel through time or talk to animals.\n\n\"Citizen Science\" is just one of many video games developed by Games + Learning + Society (GLS). GLS is a company that calls itself one of the longest standing games-for-learning research centers in the world.\n\nIt is a key player in a growing field that brings scientists, educators and game designers together. The goal of GLS is to change traditional science education methods using video games. Their games promote learning about biological systems, civic activism, empathy and even literacy.\n\nThe creators of these video games do not want to replace teachers and traditional education methods. However, their hope is that these games can be used by teachers to work alongside their lesson plans.\n\n## \"Citizen Science\" To The Rescue\n\nKurt Squire grew up playing and learning from video games. As co-director of GLS, Squire tries to create games that make learning science a more active process.\n\n\"I was personally struck by the fact that we have these lakes right in downtown Madison that you can't really swim in,\" he said. That curiosity caused him to make \"Citizen Science.\"\n\nIn the game, players look for the causes of pollution at Lake Mendota. They must travel through time, collect evidence and eventually clean up the lake. Students can learn how interconnected ecosystems are and witness the long-term effects of pollution. These are lessons that can be difficult to observe and measure during a single semester, which makes the video game a very helpful format for teaching.\n\nRobert Bohanan truly believes that videos games are an effective tool for teaching science. He worked closely with GLS on \"Citizen Science.\" Bohanan also works with high school students as an outreach program manager. \"Citizen Science\" allows him to imitate lake ecosystems and to reach more students than he can with typical teaching materials.\n\n## Changing Viewpoints In Education\n\nSeveral years ago, teachers were unsure about the role video games could play in education. Now, however, it seems that teachers are starting to embrace the idea. The question is no longer whether video games should be used, but, rather, how they should be used.\n\nMike Lawton is a science teacher at Milwaukee's Rufus King International School-High School Campus. He gave feedback to GLS on \"Citizen Science\" and uses the game in his lessons.\n\nPart of the shift toward educational games is due to the increasing familiarity of gaming in society. The rise in smartphone and tablet use is making gaming more available to everyone.\n\n## Gathering Proof For Support\n\nThis new field remains young. Experts are still gathering proof about how effective educational video games can be. There are several studies that hint at the potential for these games being able to help students actually learn scientific concepts and not just memorize facts.\n\nEveryone in the field seems to agree: This new wave of scientific video games depends on effective teachers and lesson plans to bring out the best in them.\n\n\"I really see them as being a complementary piece to what's already going on in classrooms,\" Lawton said.'"

            "text": "\tNEW YORK, N.Y. - The Girl Scouts' membership is dwindling faster than a box of Thin Mints. But its leaders hope technology can help reverse that decline. They are expanding a program that allows Girl Scouts to sell cookies through apps and on their personalized websites.\n\nThe Digital Cookie upgrade, announced in early December, comes at a challenging time for the 103-year-old organization. According to figures, youth membership for this year was 1.88 million, down 6 percent from 2014. Adult membership was 784,120, down 3 percent.\n\nThe total membership is now 2.66 million - a drop of more than 15 percent over three years. Even worse, membership has decreased 30 percent from a peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003.\n\nThe Girl Scouts are a charity and depend on donations to keep running. Lately, they also are struggling to raise money. The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper that covers nonprofit groups, showed the organization received $103 million in donations in 2014, down from almost $195 million in 2006. Back then, the Girl Scouts ranked 83rd among U.S. charities for such donations; the Chronicle now ranks it 257th.\n\n## Many Youth Groups See Declines\n\nSome other major youth groups are also losing donations and members. Changes in society and people's habits are thought to be one cause. However, Anna Maria Chavez, CEO of Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA), says her organization can gain new members through technological improvements.\n\nFor paid workers and volunteers, these include online toolkits. One tool makes it easier to join the Girl Scouts. Another empowers volunteer troop leaders to plan a full year of meetings and activities with a single online visit.\n\n\"Our volunteers need more tools to serve more girls,\" Chavez said. \"So we're really doubling down on technology.\"\n\nFor the girls themselves, Digital Cookie is the biggest opportunity to become more tech savvy. Chavez said the tool helps girls run and manage their Girl Scout cookie business online.\n\n## Website Includes Learning Games\n\nAbout 160,000 Girl Scouts participated in the program over the past year. They sold cookies the traditional in-person way, but also sold nearly 2.5 million boxes of cookies online. For the coming year, about 90 percent of the GSUSA's 112 regional councils will participate in Digital Cookie. Various new features have been added to make it more educational and fun.\n\nSome of these include an online game called Cookie Booth Bounce to help girls improve decision-making and skills in managing money. A \"Learning to Run a Business\" section can also be found on the website. Girls can post videos about themselves and how they plan to spend the money they earn.\n\nDigital Cookie's fans include 18-year-old Claire Houston, who spent 13 years with the Girl Scouts in New York. Claire is college freshman in Massachusetts. She studies computer science and is a coach for a Girl Scout robotics team.\n\nDigital Cookie \"is a great way to connect with how the world is changing right now,\" she said. \"Technology is such a big part of our lives.\"\n\n## Some Speak Out Against Changes\n\nExpanding its technology has not been problem-free. A memo from the Girl Scouts' communications office said some councils across the United States experienced membership declines and service disruptions while adjusting to the new systems.\n\nTo make improvements for the long run, GSUSA decided to accept the short-term problems, the memo said.\n\nSome complaints about program changes and cost have been posted on the \"GSUSA, Are You Listening?\" Facebook page. It serves as a place for complaints by Girl Scout volunteers who are uneasy about the organization's direction. Some worry that the GSUSA is moving too far away from camping, the earning of badges, and other traditional activities.\n\nSuellen Nelles is the most outspoken objector among the 112 council CEOs. She recently posted a detailed complaint to the Facebook page. She criticized the national leadership and urged it to work more closely with staff and volunteers at the councils.\n\n## Girls Will Show The Way, Leader Says\n\n\"The leadership is fine with maintaining all the power,\" and leading from the top-down, said Nelles, who heads the Farthest North Girl Scout Council in Fairbanks, Alaska. \"We have forgotten ... that we are only as strong as our all-volunteer membership.\"  \n\nNelles, however, has received little support from other council CEOs. Chavez insisted the national office and the councils are collaborating more now than at any time during her seven years running the Girl Scouts.\n\n\"We know we'll continue to have challenges,\" Chavez said. \"But here's our secret power: We're a family with a clear purpose - creating girls of courage, confidence and character. The girls are going to lead the way for us.\"'"

            "text": "\tSEATTLE, Wash. - Anand Mariappan is a software expert who works at Microsoft. He spends his days at work building data-analysis tools designed for people like him. That is, office workers who are used to high-resolution computer monitors, quick Internet and the comforts of a modern office building.\n\nBut in January, the 31-year-old software developer spent three weeks working hard to help a different kind of client: new companies trying to launch in Kampala, Uganda.\n\nIn Africa, Mariappan had to shift his focus and priorities. Things that were important in his regular work in Seattle were not as important to his customers in Africa. Things like making sure an app would operate smoothly on the iPhone did not have quite the same importance as making sure software could just work. Internet regularly shuts down in Africa, which creates a new challenge for people working in technology.\n\n## Different Resources, Different Needs\n\n\"Here, you have so many resources. Engineering talent, easily available Internet,\" Mariappan said. \"In developed countries, you don't consider some of those factors.\"\n\nMariappan's trip to Africa was part of Microsoft's MySkills4Afrika initiative. The program has been around for two years. So far, MySkills4Afrika has sent about 400 Microsoft employees to the country for two- to three-week projects. During their time abroad, staff work closely with customers around Africa countries to share their particular skills, from software development to marketing.\n\nThe initiative serves a few different purposes. It is in part a business-development effort, helping to increase Microsoft's role in the global technological space. It is a way for employees to learn leadership skills through working with news types of customers in different settings. It also helps Microsoft's brand as a company. Microsoft says that the program is designed to increase the technological potential of the companies and government agencies in Africa. It also improves Microsoft's reputation and expands the number of clients the company in Africa.\n\n## \"Not A Philanthropy, Not A Charity\"\n\n\"It's not philanthropy, it is not a charity,\" said Fernando de Sousa, Microsoft's human resources chief for the Middle East and Africa and the program's founding manager. De Sousa said Microsoft invests in Africa to support economic development.\n\nMicrosoft's work in Africa started in South Africa, which has long been the continent's largest and most advanced economy. Many other U.S. companies also target investments in South Africa.\n\nDe Sousa joined Microsoft in South Africa in 1992 and he was on the team in 2005 that helped develop an important strategy for Africa. The project focused on how technology could help fulfill the United Nations' development goals for the continent. The U.N.'s goals were aimed at improving the economy and state of Africa. Party because of this strategy, in 2013 Microsoft announced a three-year MySkills4Afrika initiative.\n\n\"In the background there was the understanding that we needed to think about Africa in a different way,\" said de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique.\n\nLike most major international aid programs, the initiative has not run perfectly. While some projects have succeeded, others have flopped. In the program's early days, Microsoft pushed African customers to adopt a low-cost, Windows-powered smartphone. According Winnie Karanu, a program manager with Microsoft in Kenya, Africa, the attempt \"did not go so well.\" To make matters more challenging, during the time Microsoft was pushing the African smartphone, it was falling far behind Google and Apple as a leader in the smartphone industry. It could not keep up with either company anywhere in the world.\n\n## \"But I Learned A Lot\"\n\nBut even with those setbacks, Microsoft has made a positive impact in Africa. The company has launched successful training programs, internships for youth, and the MySkills4Afrika program.\n\nMariappan's work in Uganda has focused on teaching others about Power BI, which is Microsoft's new tool that helps customers analyze different types of data. He spent time teaching companies how to use information about sales from farm goods to make better business decisions. He also helped a startup company build mobile-payment tools.\n\n\"My goal was to teach,\" he said. \"But I learned a lot.\"\n\nEileen Chou, a manager in Microsoft's information technology support group, had the opportunity to participate in the program as well. She spent three weeks in Kenya last October, where she worked with a few other Microsoft employees to train the Kenya Red Cross' IT department. They focused on improving the ways that employees work with technology. They also helped Africans become familiar using Microsoft software.\n\nChou said that while working in Africa, the team realized that companies all over the world face similar challenges during their work. \"You always feel like you never have enough people to do everything; you always wear multiple hats,\" she said.\n\n\"We all would do it again in a heartbeat,\" Chou added.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama plans to move faster to bring high-speed Internet to American public schools. On Tuesday, he pledged to make sure students in the United States have every advantage that \"some child in South Korea has right now.\"\n\nObama told a crowd at a school in Adelphi, Maryland, \"We shouldn't give that kind of competitive advantage over to other countries.\"\n\nHe added, \"In a country where we expect free Wi-Fi with our coffee, we should definitely demand it in our schools.\"\n\nObama made the remarks as he revealed plans to speed up the start of his pet project. He wants to link schools to the Internet using both money from the government and money from businesses. Several U.S. companies are pitching in about $750 million in goods and services to help students get connected to the World Wide Web. They include Apple, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Sprint and Verizon.\n\n## Obama's \"ConnectED\" Plan\n\nThe money from the companies will be used, along with $2 billion from the government's Federal Communications Commission. It is also called the FCC. For about 20 million students, the money will mean they can get Wi-Fi in their schools and libraries over the next two years. It is a lot sooner than Obama anticipated when he launched his \"ConnectED\" plan last year.\n\nBack then, White House officials expected that the FCC would have to go through a long rule-making process to get access to $2 billion. Right now, that money is already dedicated to building capacity for high-speed Internet. But the FCC recently decided it could give out the money faster. This will speed up the funding of high-speed Internet projects without having to vote on it.\n\nThe accelerated schedule comes without a single vote of Congress, Obama pointed out Tuesday. He also added that it won't add a dime to the debt the United States has.\n\nBut the president also warned lawmakers that he was about to ask them to pitch in.\n\nHe said he would ask Congress to \"give teachers using cutting-edge technology the training they deserve.\" That way, he says the technology the government is investing in can be used to its fullest.\n\nThe challenge showed Obama using his new second-term plan. He noted in his State of the Union speech that he would announce what he would do, then take action. After that, he would urge Congress to make more sweeping changes. In this case, he's also rallying business leaders who have invested in these projects to bring their own voices to the call for congressional action.\n\n\"I'm going to ask every business leader to join us in this effort,\" President Obama said, \"to give every young person every shot at success.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO, Ill. - Hundreds of students at Prospect High School set aside their smartphones and tablets in favor of the glossy pages in their yearbooks.\n\n\"With social media, the pictures and messages we post kind of go up, and then they go away,\" said high school senior Caroline Chengary. She is the editor of the 2015 edition of the Prospect High School yearbook Crest.\n\n\"I always loved looking at my mom's old high school yearbooks,\" she said. The yearbooks are the one thing from high school \"that you can keep with you, and look back at when you're older.\"\n\n## Digital Yearbooks? Not Yet ...\n\nToday, teenagers are strongly tied to technology and some rarely open hardcover and paperback books. But students, teachers and business experts agree that high school yearbooks remain popular with students.\n\nThe use of printed textbooks has continued to slow as improvements in technology allow for more materials to be digitized. Yet yearbook sales have managed to hold steady for the past five years. This is because there has been an increase in class sizes at schools.\n\nKevin Miller is the vice president of Lifetouch, a company that produces yearbooks. He said that Lifetouch had tried making digital yearbooks, but decided to stop making them. There's something special about being able \"to actually feel the book in your hand,\" he said about hard-copy yearbooks.\n\n## ... But Digital Links In Some\n\nThat is not to say that the yearbook hasn't changed.\n\nMurad Velani works at Jostens, a Minneapolis company that has published yearbooks for 65 years. He said that some high schools are even bringing digital technology into their hard-copy yearbooks.\n\nThe technology uses a smartphone app. It tags photos with digital links to videos of special events, like a prom or a winning football game. The students can then use their phones or tablets to watch these videos attached to these photos.\n\nStill, Velani thinks that many high school students prefer the traditional style of hard-copy yearbooks.\n\n\"Facebook and other kinds of social media have their place, but the messages are just fleeting moments in time,\" Velani said.\n\n## \"Permanent And Old-Fashioned\"\n\nPete Macabobby works at Wheaton Warrenville South High School and advises the students who design its yearbook. He said that this past year, the school sold 1,300 yearbooks for $50 each.\n\nMacabobby said the school sells a yearbook to more than half of the students. His school's yearbook is produced by 10 students who are members of a yearbook club.\n\nThe school looked into using video clips for its yearbooks, but students seem to prefer \"a high school yearbook that's permanent and old-fashioned,\" Macabobby said. He senses that \"there's starting to be a bit of backlash from students who don't want to be too plugged in. The kids seem to have a desire to dwell on things a little bit more.\"\n\nAt New Trier High School, the spring tradition of distributing the school yearbook includes a celebration for the seniors. A jazz band performs while students gather to write in each other's yearbooks.\n\n\"Our yearbook sales are as strong as they've ever been,\" said Kevin Bond, a yearbook adviser at New Trier. \"Students tweet, text and Snapchat, but they see that as a very temporary thing. When it comes to reading, many kids I talk to overwhelmingly prefer a real book in paper, which is so different from all their media experiences.\"\n\nAt Prospect High, junior Brady Schwartz was all smiles as he picked up his yearbook. \"It's always exciting to see your pictures in the yearbook,\" he said. \"And when the yearbooks are handed out, you know it's that much closer to the end of the school year.\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - At first, the police shooting triggered a public outcry. It looked as if it might lead to a full-blown crisis similar to the recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nThe incident occurred in 2011, in Rialto, California. Police there shot and wounded a man who witnesses later insisted was unarmed. Outrage grew after cellphone video taken from a nearby balcony suggested that police had overreacted.\n\nIn the Ferguson case, it is still not clear why Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown at least six times. In Rialto, however, things turned out differently simply because an  officer was wearing a small camera on his uniform.\n\nThe officer's camera revealed what was unseen from above: The suspect, who had bolted from his car and run into the street, was waving a handgun in the air.\n\nThe footage allowed police to defend themselves against allegations of excessive force. \"We were very, very upset about how they reacted,\" Captain Randy De Anda said of protesters. \"We said, 'If you want transparency, here are the actual facts.'\"\n\n## Large Departments Testing Cameras\n\nCop cameras are catching on around the nation, and their use will likely grow as the anger over Ferguson continues.\n\nBody-worn cameras are usually placed on an officer's chest, shoulder or cap. The Los Angeles Police Department is testing the cameras, and New York has announced plans to do so as well. The Justice Department is considering providing other police departments with funding for cameras.\n\nSome local law enforcement agencies are resisting the campaign. Others, however, say that there are possible benefits, as seen in the Rialto case.\n\n\"If the public has this type of technology with cellphones and iPads, why not all the better that we have this resource for our officers too?\" De Anda said.\n\n## \"Video Can Prove Or Disprove\"\n\nIn Salt Lake City, for instance, an officer shot and killed a 20-year-old man on Aug. 11, two days after Brown was slain in Ferguson. In Utah, however, the officer was wearing a body camera. The video will probably play a key role in deciding whether the officer reacted inappropriately.\n\nIn Rialto, 120 officers were given cameras in early 2012. Since then, complaints of police abuse have dropped sharply.\n\nAccording to California Congressman Adam B. Schiff, having a \"video record of events\" helps prevent \"the use of excessive force.\" When it comes to allegations of police brutality, video can prove or disprove those claims, he added.\n\nIn Los Angeles, about 30 officers who patrol Skid Row, a dangerous neighborhood, have been testing various body camera models. The goal is to eventually purchase about 500 cameras.\n\nThe plan originated with Steve Soboroff, president of the commission that oversees the Los Angeles Police Department. On his first day as a commissioner last year, he said the cameras were important and vowed to raise funds to buy them. He has since raised more than $1 million.\n\nSchiff said the cameras would more than pay for themselves because the videos would discourage false lawsuits against the police. \"The savings can be quite dramatic, through improved community relations\" and a drop in lawsuits, he said.\n\n## Cameras Capture What Went Right, And Wrong\n\nSuch may be the result in the Salt Lake City shooting, according to local police officials.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the prosecutor to finish his investigation and then we'll release (the footage) as a public document,\" Police Chief Chris Burbank said this week. The footage, he said, will show what happened \"through the eyes of a police officer ... These cameras are capturing good work by law enforcement. If we're doing something wrong, it will capture that too. But it is an advantage for all law enforcement - what the camera captures is a factual representation of what took place.\"\n\nBurbank said it started with 15 cameras two years ago, an idea born from his work as vice president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. By the end of next month, about 440 officers will get cameras, he said. Around the country, he added, about a dozen cities use cameras.\n\nIn Rialto, the number of police use-of-force events dropped 66 percent the first year cameras were worn. In the second year, complaints against the police decreased 83.3 percent.\n\nDe Anda said they spent $100,000 on the cameras over the two years. The money went not only to purchase the devices - each cost about $1,200 - but also to run a website to store the images.\n\n\"We have had a big success,\" De Anda said. \"Great success.\"'"

            "title": "Lots of anticipation for the new iPhone",
            "text": "\tCUPERTINO, Calif. - Apple is investing heavily in sapphire. The technology company isn't putting its money into the precious gem, but instead into a man-made version that is nearly scratch-proof, as well as sensitive to the touch.\n\nThe ever-secretive company has been mum on its plans. However, Apple has been patenting numerous inventions that use synthetic - or man-made - sapphire crystals. Recently, Apple signed a $578 million deal with a manufacturer to grow a man-made version of the mineral at a massive Mesa, Arizona, factory. The facility will eventually pump out more sapphire than the rest of the world combined, said Eric Virey. He is an analyst at research company Yole Developpement.\n\n## Hopes For A Fancy IPhone Upgrade\n\nThe deal has triggered speculation that iPhones will soon receive a luxurious upgrade. Sapphire is one of the hardest minerals in the world after diamond. By using the man-made sapphire, Apple could give consumers a much tougher screen. Experts say sapphire is not only harder than glass but also more sensitive to the touch. The material will perhaps help Apple as it tries to get into new industries such as online payments, gaming and medicine.\n\n\"It opens up a lot of doors for Apple,\" said Matt Margolis. He is an analyst at PTT Research.\n\nCurrent models of the iPhone already contain touches of sapphire. The material shields the camera lens and the fingerprint scanner. With an increased supply, analysts predict Apple will use sapphire to make screens for the next version of the iPhone and perhaps for a wearable device like a smartwatch. Apple is expected to announce the next generation iPhone in a week. Apple and GT Advanced Technologies, the sapphire manufacturer it is working with, refused to talk about the deal.\n\n## A Tougher Screen Is Attractive\n\nIt's a big investment, even for wealthy Apple. Sapphire is far more expensive than the glass it now uses. The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and manufacturers have to take chances to set themselves apart from the pack, Virey said.\n\nThe display, Virey said, remains one of the major opportunities to stand out.\n\nWhen searching for materials for smartphone screens, manufacturers' key concerns are hardness and transparency. Sapphire, which is clear in its pure form, is a top choice, said Andrew Hsu. He is director at Synaptics, which develops touch-screens.\n\n\"Other than the fact that it's expensive, it's pretty much a better material than glass,\" he said.\n\nA screen made of sapphire would likely be tougher to scratch or crack than Gorilla Glass. According to experts, Gorilla Glass is the chemically strengthened glass Apple has used in recent iPhones. The hardness of sapphire could be a strong selling point for customers. About 11 percent of iPhone users have a device with a cracked screen, according to SquareTrade. The company sells insurance for electronic devices.\n\n## Better Than Gorilla Glass?\n\nBut sapphire has a softer side. Touch-screen devices recognize a user's finger by detecting the change in the electrical field above the display. Sapphire has better electrical properties than glass. It picks up on touch more easily, experts say. GT claims that sapphire performed 42 percent better than Gorilla Glass in touch testing.\n\nA spokesman defended Gorilla Glass's durability and sensitivity. Experts also note that the toughness of sapphire depends on how it's cut. A screen made from sapphire might not hold up better than one made of Gorilla Glass.\n\nTouch-screen technology is already advanced. Analysts, though, see plenty of room for improvement. With a sapphire screen, a device might be able to sense fingerprints across the entire display. That could make online payments easier. It would let users save the prints of multiple fingers or sign their signature more easily on their smartphone screens, Margolis said.\n\n## Easier Typing\n\nSapphire screens would also allow for more precise typing. They could even recognize instruments ranging from styluses to old-fashioned pencils, experts say. A more responsive screen also promises to make gaming more fun.\n\n\"This can improve the user experience in gaming, typing and playing instruments in apps like Garage Band,\" according to Carolina Milanesi. She is chief of research and head of U.S. business at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.\n\nThe technology could also help preschoolers use Apple devices more easily. Although many young children love technology, glass touch-screens have trouble picking up their little fingers, Hsu said.\n\nWhat's more, sapphire is denser than glass. That means Apple may be able to use a thinner layer to shield its devices, Hsu said. With slim phones in fashion, that's an important consideration, he noted.\n\n\"Everyone's looking at ways to save tenths of millimeters,\" Hsu said.\n\n## All Eyes On Apple\n\nAs with other technological breakthroughs, Apple was not the first to adopt sapphire. Yet, it may be the company to set the standard for the smartphone industry. Luxury smartphone-maker Vertu offers phones with sapphire screens. Also, Kyocera recently released a device with such sapphire display.\n\nAnalysts say smartphone manufacturers will be watching Apple as they consider whether to use sapphire in their own devices. Of course, if sapphire spreads across the market, Apple would have to find a new way to wow consumers. Could a diamond screen be next?\n\n\"I wouldn't rule that out,\" Hsu said, laughing.'"

            "text": "\t\"Dr. Who\" is a British TV show that has passionate fans all over the world. Tim Warner, the head of a movie theater company, had never heard of it.\n\nSo Warner wasn't sure when executives from BBC America told him they wanted to broadcast a special 50th anniversary episode of the show in his theaters across the U.S. and Latin America.\n\nIn the end, he agreed. The episode, \"Dr. Who: The Day of the Doctor,\" came to theaters in late November. So did the fans.\n\nHundreds of \"Whovians\" -- fans of the show about a time traveler and his adventures -- came to theaters dressed as their favorite characters. More than 700 theaters, from Los Angeles to New York to Brazil, showed the episode.\n\n\"Dr. Who\" is an example of a \"cult classic\" -- a movie or TV show that isn't widely popular, but is adored by a group of fans.\n\n## Beaming Down To Theaters\n\n\"To be honest, many of us had never heard of 'Dr. Who,'\" said Warner, who runs the nation's third-largest theater chain, Cinemark Holdings Inc. \"They told us it was going to sell out. We said, 'Yeah, right.' Not only did it sell out, but people showed up in costumes.\"\n\nTickets sold so quickly that theaters showing the episode had to add more screens to make space for everyone. The event was a big success.\n\nIt convinced Warner that what happened with \"Dr. Who\" was only the beginning. There are many TV shows, sports programs and other \"alternative entertainment\" that could draw people to movie theaters to watch something other than movies.\n\nAlthough the show is British, it has fans all over the world, including in Latin America. Fred Medina, executive vice president of Latin America for BBC Worldwide, said the \"Dr. Who\" screenings demonstrated a new way to connect with international fans of the show.\n\n\"It's about building a broader relationship with our audiences,\" Medina said.\n\nAfter the success of \"Dr. Who,\" Warner is interested in showing TV shows, concerts and sporting events at his theaters. A new satellite network has made it possible to send live entertainment to most theaters in America.\n\nTheater businessmen such as Warner are sure that movies will remain their main focus. But they believe they can make money by showing something other than movies at their movie theaters.\n\nToday, \"alternative content\" like TV shows or sports make up less than 1 percent of income for major movie theater companies. But in three to five years, that could increase to 10 percent or more, Warner predicts.\n\nWe now have the technology to make this a reality, Warner said. This industry is transforming right before our eyes, he added.\n\n## From Spools To Satellites\n\nTheaters have been experimenting for several years with alternative programming, helping to fill up normally empty theaters during slow periods in the middle of the week.\n\nThey've enjoyed success with sold-out screenings of the Metropolitan Opera from New York City, World Cup soccer games in 3-D, boxing matches and mixed martial arts fights.\n\nThe digital delivery of movies has long been the goal of studios and theaters. Most theaters have already installed digital projectors.\n\nFor decades, most movies were delivered on heavy, bulky spools of actual film, which could weigh up to 25 pounds.\n\nRecently, most movies were put on digital hard drives and shipped or mailed to theaters across the country. That's a slow and expensive process.\n\nThe new satellite system makes it much cheaper to show movies in theaters.\n\nTen to 15 years ago, it cost about $2,500 to deliver a film print to a theater. By comparison, it costs about $200 to $250 to distribute digital hard drives to movie theaters.\n\nDelivering movies and TV shows by satellite is even cheaper than that.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the screens from major theater companies can show movies and other entertainment using the satellite network.\n\n## Live Broadcasts And Video Games\n\nThe new network opens up many possibilities. For example, movie theaters could host video game tournaments where players play against each other across the country in a live event.\n\nWarner hopes his company can use the expanding satellite network to show many different types of entertainment at movie theaters. He imagines live \"American Idol\" or NCAA championship basketball.\n\nFox, Sony, Disney and other studios are discussing the possibility of showing their sports and TV shows in theaters.\n\nPeople often pay extra to watch HBO or a big boxing match, said Steve Bunnell, who works with Warner. With the satellite system, people will be paying to watch TV programs on a huge screen with great sound.\n\n\"You literally have the largest premium pay-per view network in the world,\" Bunnell said.\n\nBunnell recently attended a BBC conference in England, where he discussed other BBC shows that could be shown in his company's theaters.\n\nPutting live sports on movie screens could be a challenge, however.\n\nTraditionally, it has been difficult and expensive for theaters to get permission from sports leagues to show big games in theaters. Television sports networks  spend millions of dollars on the rights to broadcast games. They may also have problems with the idea.\n\nBut Warner argues that theaters would work with networks, not work against them. Theaters could provide another place to promote their shows and events.\n\n\"To me, it doesn't compete with TV or sports bars,\" Warner said.'"

            "text": "\tRIYADH, Saudi Arabia - Hala Radwan returned to Saudi Arabia from France with a business degree and found a job at a large international company. She also found she had a unique problem: she did not know how she would get to and from work.\n\nWomen are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia offers few choices in public transportation and hiring a driver was very expensive. She also did not want to deal with the rude comments she would face if she tried to hail a cab. A woman using public transportation on her own is often seen as lacking morals in this society.\n\n\"It was a nightmare,\" she said.\n\nFriends tipped her off to a solution: Uber and a local company called Careem.\n\n## Rides Are Convenient, But Expensive\n\nSmartphone apps for ride services are becoming very popular in Saudi Arabia's major cities and a large number of young people who are familiar with technology use them. Customers include foreign businessmen who do not want to deal with the country's confusing taxi system. However, more than 80 percent of individual users are women, the app companies say.\n\nThe apps have helped women move about freely and become more independent. Otherwise they have to rely on a male relative to ferry them around in the country that believes in a strict form of Islam. However, with the prices starting at about $5 a ride, even supporters of the apps admit that the rides are not cheap.\n\nRadwan, 29, spends nearly $700 a month on rides from Careem.\n\nThe cost is slightly higher than for a taxi, but she finds that she can depend on the apps. They are also safer since both Uber and Careem use GPS technology to track their cars. With a few taps, she can see who will be driving her, the type of vehicle he uses and his customer ratings.\n\nBetter still, no one can tell she is not using a private car.\n\n## Apps Keep Growing\n\nAt least four ride-booking apps are available for download in Saudi Arabia, with more planned. The technology is the same as that used in the United States or Europe, but there are some important differences.\n\nNone of the companies work with drivers who use their personal cars, as is the case in other countries. The practice in the United States or Europe allows the companies to carry passengers for cheaper than a taxi or limousine service. Yet, in other countries this practice has created conflict with taxi companies. In Saudi Arabia, they say, the companies get their cars and drivers from licensed businesses.\n\n\"We're trying to be good citizens and stay within the rules and offer a better quality of service,\" Careem's founder, Mudassir Sheikha, said.\n\nHis company, which has its headquarters in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, was one of the first to enter the Saudi market in summer 2013. It now has nearly 100,000 users in the kingdom, a figure growing at about 40 percent per month, he said.\n\n\"There are some (women) that take five to 10 trips with us every day,\" Sheikha said. \"We don't see that kind of traffic anywhere.\"\n\n## Few Choices For Women To Get Around\n\nUber, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, operates in more than 300 cities in 56 countries around the world. It entered the Saudi market a year ago and has also seen fast growth.\n\nThere is no actual law banning women from driving in Saudi Arabia. However, as a result of fatwas, or religious orders from traditional Muslim clerics, the government will not grant women driving licenses.\n\nFamilies who can afford it will hire a driver to take female members to work, school, out shopping or to friends' houses, but even that choice does not always work.\n\n\"I have a driver, but sometimes he is too busy bringing my sisters from school,\" said Gamar al-Douh, age 24. She comes from a family of three girls with no brothers to help with the driving. \"If I don't have someone to take me, I use Uber.\"\n\n## Getting A Ride Can Be Stressful\n\nRadwan and her husband considered a driver, but decided against it. The couple got married two years ago and are trying to save money to buy a house and raise a family.\n\nHer husband could give her a ride to work, but that would take him out of his way.\n\nShe and her friends used to always exchange phone numbers for good drivers, but she said they were not always available.\n\n\"If you can't find a driver, you have to wait for your husband. If not your husband, then your brother. And you know sometimes everyone is just so busy that going from point A to point B is really difficult,\" she said. \"You can't even walk because (often) there's no sidewalk, so you're afraid of getting hit by a car.\"\n\nBut now the conversation with her friends has changed. If one of them needs a driver, they tell her, \"Why don't you take Uber or Careem?\"'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - A top person at General Motors said technology that could lead to driverless, or autonomous, cars is improving steadily. But, drivers will be necessary for many years to come.\n\nMike Robinson, GM's vice president of sustainability and global regulatory affairs, told the U.S. House's Highways and Transit Subcommittee that for the \"foreseeable future\" drivers will \"still need to be engaged and in control.\"\n\nHe said, \"For the most part, people assume than an autonomous vehicle will take you to your destination without any personal involvement.\" This idea is still a ways off though, Robinson says.\n\nThe subcommittee called the hearing to discuss the technical advances. Many people believe that self-driving vehicles could be available in the near future, and have concerns about their safety. The committee noted that Google Inc. has said it had logged hundreds of thousands of accident-free miles in autonomous vehicles. However, Google has announced no plans to sell self-driving vehicles.\n\n## A Driverless Nissan By 2020?\n\nNissan Motor Co. CEO Carlos Ghosn has said he wants the company to make an \"affordable, autonomous-drive vehicle\" by 2020. That's according to Andrew Christensen, senior manager of technology planning at Nissan Technical Center in Michigan.\n\nChristensen acknowledged that the company hasn't determined what the exact goals would be for that vehicle. But, he said that it would have \"some level of clear autonomous capability with the driver.\"\n\nAs the subcommittee noted in a report, some cars can already do some things automatically. Cars with automatic brakes or that can park on the street themselves are available. Integration of those technologies with throttle and steering control \"will begin to reduce the need to driver control of the vehicle.\"\n\nSomeday, autonomous vehicles will navigate the road without human input. By using electronic sensors and cameras cars can react to well-defined lane and curb markers. Officials said vehicles could move more smoothly and maintain a constant distance between vehicles. The benefit is potentially a traffic system that is less congested and safer. It could also reduce fuel costs.\n\n\"This is technology that is going to be liberating,\" said Robinson.\n\n## \"Far Off In The Future\"\n\nEarlier this year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued plans for research on autonomous vehicles. It proposed to look into connected-vehicle technology. It would allow self-driving cars to communicate through wireless radio signals. That would allow for transmitting information on speed, lane departure and other info.\n\nNHTSA head David Strickland said his agency is looking closely at self-driving vehicle technology. But, he said that a fully autonomous vehicle is \"far off in the future.\"\n\nSeveral officials said one issue to getting self-driving vehicles on the road will be \"social acceptance.\" Will customers buy expensive automobiles that don't require as much involvement by a driver?\n\nRobinson said some autonomous technology, such as helping a vehicle maintain lane control, could be on the market within 10 years. Congress should continue to let automakers develop new features so customers can choose what they like, he said. And it should work to block any move where states would each develop their own standards for vehicles.\n\n## Road Tests\n\nKirk Steudle is the head of Michigan's Department of Transportation. But, he also testified on behalf of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. He said there is a need to speed up testing across the country and not one state at a time.\n\nLast week, Michigan's state Senate approved legislation that would allow for testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads. A handful of other states have taken similar steps. The legislation would still need to be approved in the Michigan House before becoming law in the state.\n\nAt the hearing Tuesday, there were also suggestions that the government could help protect automakers from lawsuits. At least, while the technology is developing.\n\nGM's Robinson said that GM isn't concerned with what to charge for the cars right now.\n\n\"We're not looking at what we're going to price 10 years from now. We're looking at what we do today that can add value,\" he said.\n\nStrickland said as the research continues, the government will have to make sure the technology is safe.\n\nThe first big news, he said, is about what any technological leap promises. But, the second is if one of these technologies doesn't do what it is supposed to do.'"

She is also the lead author of the study, published in the scientific journal Computers in Human Behavior.\n\n## Away From Their Electronic Devices\n\nUhls said the idea for the study came from watching her daughter. \"I've been at parties where the kids are all hanging out, but instead of looking at each other, they are staring at their phones.\"\n\nThe researchers wanted to see what would happen if children had to spend an extended period of time without devices.\n\nUhls and professor Patricia Greenfield found a sixth-grade class that goes to a wilderness camp in Southern California for five days. At the camp, the students cannot use electronics.\n\nWhen the class of about 50 children arrived at the camp, they took two tests to measure their ability to read nonverbal social cues. In the first, the kids were asked to judge the emotions in 48 photos of people making faces. In the second test, they watched a video with no sound and then judged the actor's emotions.\n\nAt the end of the five-day camp, the kids took the tests again. According to researchers, the kids made an average of 14.02 errors on the face-recognition test at the beginning of their camp stay but only 9.41 errors by the end.\n\nOn the video test, they correctly named an average of 26 percent of the emotional states at the beginning of camp. By the end of their five-day stay, the students got 31 percent correct.\n\n## Tech Savvy Versus Social Savvy\n\nUhls said the researchers were surprised to see those results after just five days. She was encouraged by what they showed though. If lack of face-to-face time is changing people's ability to understand emotion, she said, the results suggest that putting devices away for five days is enough time to improve that ability.\n\nThe researchers gave the same test to 54 sixth-graders from the same school who had not yet attended the camp. That group, known as a control group, made an average of 12.24 mistakes the first time they took the photo test. Like the group at camp, they made 9.81 mistakes five days later.\n\nFor the video test, the students' scores stayed flat. Students in the control group got an average of 28 percent of the emotions correct both times they were tested.\n\nThe end results of the two groups were not that different. The group at camp showed a larger improvement over the five days than the control group.\n\nUhls said she noticed the similar results. The researchers are focusing on the change the kids showed over time because the groups started at different levels.\n\nUhls and Greenfield said the results of their study suggest that it is important for kids to spend time away from computer screens and iPads. It does not necessarily suggest that all screen time is bad. They hope people understand it's important that kids have time for face-to-face socializing.\n\n\"I love media, my kids are media-savvy, but it is really important to have a balance,\" Uhls said.'"

            "title": "Spanish books find a Nook, and a Kindle, in U.S. market",
            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - For decades, finding Spanish-language books in the U.S. was tough.\n\nBooksellers stocked few titles, and those they carried were very expensive. A paperback copy of \"Don Quixote\" in the original Spanish could easily cost triple the price of a deluxe hardcover translation in English. If, that is, it could be found at all.\n\nBooksellers blamed the cost of importing books printed in Spain and Latin America. And U.S. publishers lost faith in the market after a series of failed attempts to translate English-language bestsellers. These efforts had resulted in Spanish versions filled with errors that sold poorly.\n\nThe upshot was a frustrating situation: Even in heavily Latino cities such as Los Angeles, readers of \"libros en espanol,\" or \"books in Spanish,\" could find little.\n\n\"There was a tremendous appetite for Spanish-language books that wasn't being met,\" said David Kipen, who runs Libros Schmibros, a Los Angeles used bookstore with many Latino customers.\n\n## Spanish Titles Triple\n\nBut lately, the nation's 38 million Spanish speakers have been finding a lot more to read. This is thanks in large part to the Internet. The explosion of portable digital reading devices, or e-readers, such as Amazon's Kindle and Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook, has changed the game.\n\nFor the first time, publishers of Spanish-language books are able to market their electronic books to U.S. buyers. And often at a fraction of the cost of printed versions.\n\nIn the last two years, the number of Spanish-language titles available in the U.S. has tripled at some online booksellers. Imported hardcovers such as Colombian author Alvaro Mutis' \"Maqroll\" trilogy once sold for more than $100. Now those same books can be bought online for less than $15.\n\nAnd entire genres of Latin American literature that were all but impossible to acquire at any price are now a few mouse clicks away. Take, for example, modern Ecuadorean poetry.\n\nSpanish-language book sales are still small, and account for less than 5 percent of the nation's $7.1 billion in annual sales. But their rapid growth has challenged some long-held ideas. Within the book industry, this has led to a greater focus on Spanish-language titles.\n\n\"There has been a real shift,\" said publishing industry journalist Ed Nawotka. \"I see confidence in the market that has never been there before.\"\n\n## \"An Incredible Change\"\n\nLuis Alcaraz is a native of Mexico now living in Las Vegas. When he bought a Kindle four years ago, he said, there was \"practically nothing available to download in Spanish.\"\n\nToday, Alcaraz said, he finds a seemingly endless supply of interesting electronic titles in his native language. These include specialized technical books on things like computers, and the science fiction stories he likes to read on flights. To date, he's bought 97 Spanish e-books for his Kindle.\n\n\"There's just been an incredible change,\" said Alcaraz.\n\nAlcaraz's experience is not unique. Latinos are buying tablet computers, like iPads, and e-readers far faster than the U.S. population as a whole. In 2011, about 1 in 20 Hispanics owned such a device; in 2012, the number had jumped to nearly 1 in 5.\n\nThat rapid shift, said book industry executive Patricia Arancibia, gives many the belief that \"this market could work.\" Arancibia herself founded Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook Books en Espanol site.\n\nBefore 2010, she said, only about 10,000 Spanish-language print titles were in stock at online booksellers in the U.S. This was out of a total of about 650,000 Spanish titles worldwide.\n\nToday, there are nearly 65,000 Nook books available in Spanish on Barnes &amp; Noble's website. And the story is the same over on Amazon's Spanish-language page, EBooks Kindle en Espanol. It now has more than 70,000 titles. That's more than double the number offered when the site started in April 2012.\n\n## Allende's \"El Juego de Ripper\"\n\nGrowth in electronic book sales in the U.S. has shown signs of leveling off in recent months. But downloads in languages other than English are soaring.\n\nAccording to Amazon, its sales of foreign-language e-books went up around 40 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, Audible.com said foreign-language audio book sales are increasing at more than 25 percent annually.\n\nPublishing digitally, said publishing executive Carmen Ospina, \"removes all the obstacles you have with a printed book.\" Ospina is in charge of digital development at Random House Mondadori in Spain. The U.S. now makes up 19 percent of the publisher's worldwide e-book sales, she said. That's compared to less than 10 percent a year ago.\n\nThis month, Ospina said, the publisher will release Chilean author Isabel Allende's new novel, \"El Juego de Ripper.\" The book will appear at the same time in the U.S., Spain and Latin America. In the U.S., a digital edition will cost about half the price of a hardcover copy.\n\nThe growth in Spanish-language digital books has also had benefits for printed books in Spanish. Overall, foreign publishers have grown more hopeful about the U.S. market.\n\nIndependent Publishers Group, a national distributor, has seen its sales of Spanish-language print books jump 40 percent over the last five years.\n\nAnd in July, the paperback version of \"Inquebrantable,\" the autobiography of recording artist Jenni Rivera, hit the No. 1 spot on all of Amazon.com, outselling every other book on the e-commerce site.'"

            "title": "Electronics recycling is important, but there is a tug-of-war over who pays",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - An old television. One of the first iPhones. The printer that came with a new computer.\n\nThese items are among the millions of tons of technology pitched into the trash or taken to recycling centers each year. States have been trying to get manufacturers to help pay for electronics recycling since the early 2000s. Yet half of states do not have recycling programs across their entire state. Those that do are considering how to make their programs work as the size, volume and value of recycled electronics change.\n\nMany electronic devices should not be thrown away with regular trash. They contain dangerous materials, such as mercury and lead, that can pollute soil and groundwater. Meanwhile, much of the metal, plastic and glass in devices can be recycled.\n\n## E-cycling Law Began In California\n\nCalifornia became the first state to pass a law requiring \"e-cycling,\" or electronic recycling. The law passed in 2003. In California, consumers pay a fee that supports e-cycling when they buy a product. Another 24 states and Washington, D.C., put the cost of e-cycling programs on manufacturers. Many require that the companies that make the products pay for the collection and processing of a certain amount of e-waste based on how much they sell within the state.\n\nFive states have programs that require electronics makers to help pay for local drop-off centers where people can bring their old electronics. The states are Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\nIt is difficult for manufacturers to meet all the different laws and variety of other rules, said Walter Alcorn. He is a vice president at the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA).\n\nInitially, the CEA, which represents retailers and manufacturers, asked for laws requiring consumers to pay recycling costs, as they do in California. Now the group is working with states to make existing laws similar across states. It is also trying to get laws made that electronics makers agree with.\n\n\"We want to see recycling incorporated into these corporate business models,\" Alcorn said. \"That's where they can thrive and companies can get creative in getting their customers to bring back their used products.\"\n\n## Who Picks Up The Recycling Tab?\n\nSome state laws require manufacturers to pay for a set weight of e-cycling each year. Yet these laws can backfire if the weight goals are met before the end of the year, because then manufacturers are allowed to stop paying, said Resa Dimino. She works for the Product Stewardship Institute (PSI). The group focuses on the environmental and health effects of consumer products.\n\nWhen companies stop paying, local governments or other groups have to pay for recycling efforts themselves. If not, the recycling stops, she said.\n\nPSI works with states to run their e-cycling programs. Dimino said that programs could be changed so companies that make the products have to keep paying for recycling collection.\n\nManufacturers in Washington and Oregon pay for cities and towns to have collection sites, Dimino said. Having recycling centers close by makes it easy for residents to recycle. Since these states do not make companies meet a weight goal, the states do not have to worry that companies will suddenly get to stop paying. E-cycling in those states is more reliable as a result.\n\n## Devices Are Smaller And Smaller\n\nElectronic devices are also becoming smaller and people keep them longer. This can create a different problem. It may be difficult for electronics companies to collect enough recycled materials to meet the state weight goals, said Allison Schumacher at the CEA.\n\nShe points to recent a change in an e-cycling law in South Carolina. The change lets electronics makers work together on recycling.\n\nSchumacher said the change will give manufacturers the flexibility to meet state recycling rules. She hopes other states will be able to use it as a model.\n\nManufacturers' might also have trouble meeting weight goals because there are fewer cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to be recycled. CRTs, part of big older televisions and computer monitors, usually contain leaded glass. They have largely gone out of production since 2010. Most TVs are lightweight flat screens now.\n\nHeavy CRT devices helped manufacturers meet their recycling weight goals, but at this point fewer of them are available. Once they are gone, meeting weight goals will be harder, Schumacher said.\n\nWhen electronics are recycled they can be fixed up for resale or broken down, with manufacturers or recycling companies selling pieces such as plastic and metal.\n\n## Make Existing Laws Better\n\nStates without formal e-cycling programs are not without recycling opportunities. Programs in those states are supported by companies that host electronics buyback programs. Private organizations and local governments also have recycling efforts, said Jason Linnell, director of the National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER).\n\nInstead of pushing for more state laws, NCER helps states make existing laws work more efficiently. Linnell said he does not expect more statewide laws to pass in coming years.'"

            "text": "\tDigital technology is moving from our desktops onto our bodies. There are music players that match your tunes to your heart beat and mood sweaters that change color depending on your emotional state.\n\nThere are even fitness bracelets, anklets and necklaces to track your calorie burning.\n\nAt Chaotic Moon Studios in Austin, Texas, developers and engineers are working on a product to compete with Google's upcoming eyewear that can log onto the Internet. They're also designing other wearable projects for several other customers of the mobile software firm, from applications to full-blown products.\n\nChaotic Moon co-founder William \"Whurley\" Hurley said wearable technology will have as much of an impact as smartphones did a few years ago.\n\n## A Tech Fashion Show\n\n\"It's just like when the iPhone came out and there was this mad gold rush. It's gonna be the same thing,\" Hurley said.\n\nMutual Mobile, also in Austin, is working on Google Glass applications for a variety of clients. Google Glass is the name of Google's eyewear. Doctors might use the glasses to pull up patient information. Warehouse employees could use them to look at real-time inventory or scan bar codes.\n\n\"People are starting to get into it,\" said Sam Gaddis. He is the company's chief marketing officer.\n\nGaddis says sensors that can measure a variety of information are becoming so cheap. That helps spur the development of connected devices.\n\nMutual Mobile has hosted \"hackathons\" to encourage its developers to see what they can invent.\n\nAfter one recent event, its developers created a football with a sensor that can detect the quality of the throw. They also made a boxing game that measures how often you've hit the target.\n\nExperts say that wearables are the next big thing in tech.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some very, very big leaps in just the next year,\" tech [entrepreneur](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) Manish Chandra said. He was at a wearable technology conference and fashion show in San Francisco. Hundreds of developers, engineers and designers were at the show.\n\n## \"Augmented Reality\"\n\nWearable technologies have long been a sideshow to mainstream laptop and smartphones. Now Google Glass and rumors of Apple's iWatch are popularizing the field. Analysts forecast swift growth. Last year the market for wearable technology totaled almost $9 billion. That should climb to $30 billion by 2018, said analyst Shane Walker at IHS Global Insights. Wearable technology includes everything from hearing aids to wristband pedometers.\n\nHurley said Google's public relations campaign for its glasses made people invest in wearables.\n\n\"And that's what's been missing for the last 20 years in this area, is people actually funding these projects,\" he said. \"So now we're getting all these clients because there's all this injection of funding.\"\n\nGaming will also be affected. Look at products like the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset that enables 3-D gaming. Virtual reality technology makes you feel like you are in the middle of an artificial world.\n\nAt Austin's recent Captivate tech conference, Robin Arnott was showing off a program he'd created for the Rift. Users strap on the headset. Then the program uses their vocal tones to display a series of tunneling images, creating fantastical visual effects.\n\nArnott called it a \"meditation experience.\" He hopes to release it with the device in another year or so.\n\n\"It's like you chase yourself down the rabbit hole,\" he said of the program.\n\nArnott described devices like Google's glasses, which overlay the Internet on top of the real world, as \"augmented reality.\" Wearables \"extend your abilities as a human, just as your phone does,\" he said.\n\n## Adapting To Wearables\n\nAs wearable technologies proliferate, humans will need to adapt, said Georgia Institute of Technology professor Thad Starner. He advises Google on its glasses.\n\nThe glasses are lightweight frames equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display that responds to voice commands. Starner has worn his for several years.\n\nThe devices will cause a huge change, said Starner, eventually offering \"capabilities that people haven't thought of before.\"\n\nWearable computers are designed to be in the background, secondary to the wearer's attention, he said.\n\nBringing technology closer to your body makes the experience less noticeable, he added. \"It's more an extension of yourself,\" he said.\n\nBut there are sure to be cultural and social issues. Google Glass - and some emerging competitors - have raised concerns of people who don't want to be secretly videoed or photographed. And what about interacting?\n\n## The Cyborgs Are Coming\n\n\"Do you really want a touch screen on the front of your T-shirt? Is it socially acceptable to be poked all over your body for somebody to use your wearable computer?\" asked Genevieve Dion, who directs a fashion and technology lab at Drexel University.\n\nThe answer, for some, is no.\n\nIn a newly released survey, 42 percent of workers said they would not be willing to strap on wearable tech for their jobs. Older and more traditional employees were more reluctant than their younger counterparts. The survey by Cornerstone OnDemand polled 1,029 Americans aged 18 and over in August, and had a 3.1 percent margin of error.\n\nThen there's an issue of bandwidth, said Ritch Blasi, who researches the wearable technology market. Right now, there simply isn't enough network service to support universal and constant wireless use, he said. But that, too, will catch up.\n\n\"It almost makes you think everyone is going to turn into a cyborg,\" he said, referring to a fictional, high tech comic book superhero.\n\nAnd will they? \"When you look at the world and everything people are doing?\" Blasi said. \"I think the answer to that is yes.\"'"

            "text": "\tWhen Brookfield (Wis.) Central High School student Chloe Olier started driving earlier this summer, her parents Dany and Virginie installed a DriveCam. The monitoring device records video whenever she makes driving mistakes.\n\nShe wasn't pleased. It emails mistakes to her parents, who review the footage online with her.\n\n\"I felt violated, because it was going to be recording me,\" the 16-year-old said.\n\nChloe now says she'd recommend it to her friends because it has made her a better driver. The machine, obtained for free from the family's auto insurer, American Family Insurance, recorded her 23 times the first week. Now, she only makes infrequent mistakes.\n\n\"It's nice because it tells me what I'm doing wrong so I don't do it anymore,\" she said. It's only intrusive while it's recording, \"so in order not to feel that way, I drive well.\"\n\n## Tracking Teens: Controlling Or Life-Saving?\n\nResearch shows that electronic monitoring devices can reduce risky driving behavior by teenagers. A growing number of insurance companies and auto manufacturers are offering new products. But not many customers are using them, yet.\n\nOlier said she was the only one among her peers with a driving monitor. In interviews with Milwaukee-area families, many felt they interfered with the trust they had with their children.\n\nAccording to American Family Insurance, 15,000 families have used the DriveCam in 19 states since it launched in 2007. The company has recorded 65 percent to 70 percent fewer distractions, tailgating, speeding and other unsafe driving.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety studied a device called Tiwi that also reports unsafe driving acts. It showed that it significantly reduced risky driving behavior. The best results came when teenagers had a chance to modify their behavior before the device sent alerts to parents.\n\n\"Parents should consider using the devices, because our research shows they can be effective,\" said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the institute. He said the devices have often been a hard sell to parents. \"The monitoring is a way for a parent to be a virtual passenger supervising their teen when they're not physically in the passenger seat.\"\n\nMike Gonzalez's 17-year-old son, Chris, got his license recently. He said he wasn't considering using any technology for monitoring.\n\n\"They have to make their own decisions and make their own lives,\" he said. \"A driver's license means he's mature and he has to learn more about life.\"\n\n\"You need to teach them and then trust them to be able to do the right thing,\" said Mary Beth Mills of Fox Point, Wis. Her 16-year-old son is learning to drive.\n\n## Dangerous Behind The Wheel\n\nThat trust, however, appears generous compared to facts. Teenagers are the riskiest drivers and the most likely to crash. Motor vehicle accidents are the No. 1 cause of death for Wisconsin teenagers, for example, according to the most recent information obtained from the Department of Health.\n\nA recent State Farm survey identified what it called a dangerous trust gap between parents and children. Around 70 percent of parents in the survey thought their teenagers were \"almost always\" obeying graduated licensing restrictions. But as few as 43 percent of teenagers said they almost always followed them. Graduated licensing laws impose curfews, passenger limits and other rules on new, young drivers to reduce risky driving.\n\nJeff Pierson, a driving instructor in Milwaukee who owns Safety First Driving School, thought his teenage son was a great driver. Then, one day, he trailed him as he drove with friends.\n\n\"I tell parents: Two weeks after they've got their license and they know friends are going to be with them, follow them. I was so shocked. As soon as two girls were on the ride, he burned rubber,\" Pierson said. \"When you get three to four kids in a car, it's a party. It's just play time.\"\n\n## Safe Driving Devices\n\nWhile teen monitoring devices aren't popular, more insurance companies are offering more products since the devices emerged around seven years ago, said Loretta Worters. She is a  spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute. For example, Progressive has a black box that records speeds and braking times. 21st Century Auto Insurance offers a GPS monitoring system called MobileTEEN. It lets parents set location boundaries, curfews and maximum speed limits.\n\nAutomakers have also joined the market. In 2010, Ford released a MyKey feature, now in 6 million cars. It controls factors such as speed and radio volume, and blocks incoming calls and texts. The Automobile Dealers Association of Mega Milwaukee is evaluating a product called SeatBeltGuard. It alerts parents if their teenage drivers aren't buckled up, and also disables texts and calls, according to President Jim Tolkan.\n\nAnother company, a Wisconsin startup called TeenGrasshopper, is trying to tackle the invasiveness of the technology by shifting the burden of monitoring to other drivers. Its \"How's my driving?\" decals allow other drivers to directly connect with teenagers' parents by calling an 800 number.\n\nA bunch of smartphone apps allow parents to locate their teenagers via their phones, like iPhone's Find My Friends. Chris Anderson of Delafield, Wis., said she and her husband will likely use smartphone technology to check on their 16-year-old son, Grant, who got his license in October.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer in trusting your child, but also checking in from time to time to make sure they are where they're supposed to be,\" she said.'"

            "text": "\tWASHINGTON, D.C. - Samantha Cunningham was going to a music festival when she realized she had left her asthma medicine at home. She was halfway through a five-hour drive and her options were limited.\n\nCunningham could go back home and pick up her asthma inhaler, which could save her life if she had an asthma attack. Yet that would make her late for the concert. She could also pay more than $100 to see a doctor without an appointment and get a prescription. She could also go without her medicine and hope there would be emergency equipment to help her breathe if she had an asthma attack at the festival. That last option did not seem like a very good idea, she said.\n\nThen a friend suggested American Well, a service that lets doctors see patients on video through the Internet or a smartphone. Cunningham, 23, downloaded the phone app and entered her personal information. Soon, she was discussing her problem with Dr. Minoti Parab, a family doctor in Charlotte, North Carolina, who sees only \"telemedicine\" patients like Cunningham on her home computer.\n\nThe app and visit with Dr. Parab took about 30 minutes and cost $49, far less than a traditional office visit. When it was over, Cunningham had a prescription for a new asthma inhaler that she filled at a drugstore before arriving on time for the concert. \"It was really a perfect solution,\" she said.\n\n## An Eye Exam With A Smartphone\n\nIt's also a perfect example of telemedicine, using electronic technology to provide patient care and share medical information from afar. Several companies already offer these video consultations. They serve consumers, employers, insurers and hospitals. Large hospitals also use telemedicine to make their doctors available to small hospitals.\n\nTechnology is providing more and more solutions to medical problems. Robots help treat emergency room patients and let doctors treat stroke victims far away. New phone apps let users get full eye exams with their smartphones. Other technology helps therapists check the moods of mental health patients on a computer screen and text them instructions or warnings. These and other developments are expanding the uses of telemedicine, or \"virtual medicine\" - another term for treating patients from afar.\n\nTelemedicine could avoid about two-thirds of unnecessary emergency room visits, according to a study. The study also found that telemedicine could cut out about one-third of doctors' visits. Telemedicine is expected to grow, as patients get comfortable with it and it becomes routine for simpler problems.\n\nThe benefits of virtual medicine \"are just kind of punch-you-in-the-face clear and obvious,\" said David Francis. He is an executive at RBC Capital Markets, the banking company that published the study.\n\n## Saving Lives From Afar\n\nTelemedicine could grow even more if Medicare would cover it more. Medicare, the government-run health program for people age 65 and older, now pays for some telemedicine services for rural patients. There are some conditions though, which make telemedicine more expensive than regular medical services, according to a report by the federal government.\n\nA number of proposals in Congress would expand how much telemedicine is paid for under Medicare. The proposals have been stalled because Congress can't judge what they would cost the government.\n\nOne area lawmakers and health care experts are looking into is stroke care. There, speed can make a difference in treatment. With telemedicine, neurologists - doctors who specialize in treating the brain - can work remotely with doctors on the scene and suggest treatments to improve the patient's chances. In a nation already short of neurologists, technology helps put more doctors in more places.\n\n\"The numbers don't lie,\" said Dr. Til Jolly. \"There are not going to be all these physicians we need in all the places we need them, so we have to figure out a better way.\" Jolly is chief medical officer at Specialists On Call, a telemedicine company with more than 200 doctors in 33 states.\n\n## What Are Good And Bad Apps?\n\nVideo conferences are the bread and butter of telemedicine, but mobile apps are the new frontier. Apps seem especially good for mental health uses. Centerstone, a company that offers mental health services, said patients who used its phone app ended up in the hospital less often. The app can spot when the patients show symptoms and alert their caregivers.\n\nPatients really liked the apps, said Bob Siegmann, a Centerstone executive. They felt they could control and understand their illnesses better, he said.\n\nIt's hard to judge how much the apps helped by themselves, said John Torous, a doctor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. The lack of research on the use of apps for mental health should make therapists stop and think, he said.\n\nIt's hard to decide now what are good and bad apps, Torous said. \"We're not thinking of them medically and asking the medical questions: What are the risks and benefits of use?\" he said. \"For most of these things, we just don't know.\"'"

They are using instant-messaging apps on smartphones that disguise text messages or destroy them almost immediately.\n\nIn many cases, intelligence and law enforcement agencies can't read the messages. The phone companies and the app developers say they cannot unlock the coded text and do not keep a record of the messages.\n\n\"We're past going dark in certain instances,\" said Michael B. Steinbach, the FBI's top counterterrorism official. \"We are dark.\" In other words, the FBI has no way of knowing what suspects are telling people.\n\n## Apps Keep Identities Hidden\n\nFBI officials now want Congress to allow it to tap into messaging apps like WhatsApp and Kik, as well as apps that destroy data. Hundreds of millions of people - and apparently some fighters - use the apps to keep their identities hidden.\n\nIslamic State is an extremist group that wants to start its own country governed by Islamic law. The group's fighters have captured parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe FBI estimates that 200,000 people around the world see messages each day from Islamic State. The extremists post videos, instruction manuals and other material on Islamist social media sites.\n\nThe group's recruiters then look at Twitter, Facebook and other sites to see who is re-posting their messages. They then invite supporters to text directly on encoded or data-destroying apps. FBI agents fear they will miss important clues about potential plots because they do not have access to the messages.\n\n## Use By Islamic State Recruiters Grows\n\nIslamic State recruiters have been using these kinds of apps more over the last several months, officials said.\n\nBut details of cases in which the technology was used have been kept secret. Investigators didn't want terrorists to know they are unable to read the messages.\n\nDuring recent terrorism cases, FBI agents have stopped information from being released publicly, said the officials.\n\nSocial media companies have not been very cooperative. They have been reluctant to change their software and provide the information to law enforcement and intelligence officials.\n\nLast week, Tim Cook, the CEO at Apple, defended the decision to keep FaceTime and iMessage private.\n\n\"Let me be crystal clear,\" Cook said. \"Weakening encryption or taking it away harms good people that are using it for the right reasons.\" He said it has a chilling effect on the constitutional right of freedom of speech, as well as the country's founding principles.\n\n## Congress Learns About Militants' Tactics\n\nAt a congressional hearing Wednesday, Republican Representative Michael McCaul of Texas spoke about Kik, WhatsApp, Wickr and Surespot. He said extremists are using the apps to avoid detection. Executives from those four companies did not respond to requests for a comment.\n\n\"These tactics are a sea change for spreading terror,\" said McCaul, who is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He said the United States must completely change its way of thinking if it wants to keep up.\n\nSteinbach, the FBI's counterterrorism chief, wants social media companies to make the information available if a court orders it.\n\nPublic demand for apps that guarantee security and secrecy is growing, in part because of Edward Snowden. The former National Security Agency worker made public the fact that the government was collecting emails, phone records and other communications.\n\nThe apps are popular with business executives concerned about the threat of corporate spying. Human rights activists also use them to avoid police in countries that have bad human rights records. Some teenagers use them simply to evade their parents.\n\nKik claims more than 200 million users in 230 countries. This includes, it says, 40 percent of American youths. A \"Guide to Law Enforcement\" on Kik's website states that the text of Kik conversations is stored only on the phones of Kik users. Kik does not see or store chat messages and cannot get the information.\n\n## FBI Uses Social Media To Find Suspects\n\nU.S. officials have successfully found terrorism suspects using other social media sites.\n\nSince last summer, the FBI has arrested nearly 40 people. They were suspected of seeking to join terrorist groups or help them.\n\nThe \"vast, vast majority\" had a connection to social media, said John Carlin, head of national security for the American Justice Department. That trend is \"continuing to increase.\"\n\nOn June 2, an FBI agent and a Boston police officer shot and killed a man who they said tried to stab them. The FBI had been tracking his online communication with Islamic State for at least several days.\n\nNot long ago, the Air Force destroyed a command center in Syria. Experts discovered the location after an extremist revealed his position online.\n\nLast fall, Islamic State leaders issued an order that forbids fighters to photograph attacks and locations without permission. The group also distributed a guide. It tells them how to remove information about where cellphone pictures were taken.'"

            "title": "Toymakers look forward to crowded stores and lots of people buying",
            "text": "\tNEW YORK, N.Y. - Toy sales in the United States have been slowing in recent years. This year, people are buying again and sales are back up. That is good news for toy companies.\n\nThese days, toys have to compete to get kids' attention. Many kids have started choosing video games and mobile apps over Barbie dolls and stuffed bears. After several years of poor sales, though, the U.S. toy industry is expected to have a very strong year.\n\nThe NPD Group Inc. is a company that studies the toy industry. According to NPD, toy sales are expected to rise 6.2 percent to $19.9 billion in 2015, the biggest increase in at least 10 years.\n\nThe 2015 estimates includes the final three months of the year when sales pick up due to the holidays. Sales in October, November and December are expected to reach $9.6 million, a 5 percent increase. Last year, there was only a 3.6 percent gain during the holidays.\n\nThe strong year of sales comes after 10 years of slow growth and declines.\n\n## See A Movie, Buy The Toy\n\nWhat is giving toys a boost?\n\nAccording to experts, there are at least three factors fueling the growth of toy sales. Toys based on Hollywood movies are becoming more and more popular. At the same time, improving technology is making toys more advanced, allowing them to do things like talk back to children. Finally, toy companies are having more success reaching out to older kids.\n\nSuccessful movies have contributed to increased toy sales. For example, demand for toys related to the movie \"Frozen\" helped the toy industry achieve a rare gain last year. \"Frozen\" tells the story of a princess who sets off to find her sister with icy powers. Toys based on the film have been extremely popular. In fact, \"Frozen\" was the top toy brand last year according to NPD, reaching $531 million in sales.\n\nThe new \"Star Wars\" movie comes out on December 18. It is bringing with it another batch of popular movie-based toys. Hundreds of playthings, from puzzles to action figures related to \"Star Wars,\" are expected to boost sales for 2015.\n\nBusiness expert Marty Brochstein says that one \"Star Wars\" toy is already selling out. The \"Kylo Ren\" Deluxe LightSaber, which features motion sensor-controlled sound effects is flying off store shelves. He says \"Star Wars\" appeals to both children and adults.\n\n\"It's multi-generational,\" Brochstein says.\n\n## \"Frozen\" And \"Star Wars\" Lead The Pack\n\nHasbro, the nation's second-largest toy company, reported a jump in sales this year, helped by toys related to \"Star Wars.\" Hasbro has the major merchandising licensing rights to make Star Wars toys from now until 2020. It is also teaming up with The Walt Disney Company to make \"Frozen\" dolls in 2016.\n\nDavid Brandon is the new head of the store Toys R Us. He says the toy store is placing big bets this holiday season on brands like \"Star Wars\" to help push up sales.\n\n\"It will be very interesting to see at the end of the holiday season where the growth comes from. And how much growth there is,\" Brandon says.\n\nAnother reason experts think that more toys are being sold has to do with technology. Toymakers have begun using computer chip technology, which is getting cheaper and more powerful, in toys. As a result, toys are becoming more advanced.\n\n\"The selection is much greater than in the past,\" said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of an online toy review site called TTPM. He added that technology is making toys more appealing to young kids and teens.\n\n## Talk To Me, Barbie\n\nRemote-controlled cars and flying droids can now be controlled by smartphones. Robotic toys are becoming more life-like and now include voice recognition features. For example, Hasbro makes a toy unicorn called StarLily My Magical Unicorn. It responds to voice and touch with more than 100 sound and motion combinations.\n\nMattel, the nation's largest toy company, is also hoping technology will help it reverse years of slumping sales.\n\n\"You want to make sure that you give them enough that they're going to want to walk away from their iPads and phones,\" Mattel's Executive Vice President Geoff Walker said.\n\nMattel's new Barbie features speech recognition and can have a two-way conversation with girls. Another popular toy is \"Smart Bear,\" an interactive plush bear that links to a smartphone app to help kids learn.\n\n## Every Age Group Is Covered\n\nToys continue to be popular with younger kids, but toymakers are also focusing on grabbing the attention of the tween and preteen crowds. Kids between 8 and 12 years old account for 22 percent of toy sales, according to NPD. However, they are also the biggest users of mobile devices. Rather than buying toys, many preteens prefer video games and apps.\n\nToymakers believe they can get these kids' attention because features like voice recognition are more affordable, allowing toys to become more advanced.\n\nFor example, a toy robot called Meccano Meccanoid G15 allows kids to build and program their own personal 4-foot-tall robot that records and plays back audio, and it learns from them. It has more than 1,200 parts and tons of computer memory.\n\nToys are getting updated to appeal teenagers, too. Hasbro has created a version of its Nerf gun called Nerf Rival for kids older than 14. It shoots balls 100 feet per second. Think paint ball meets Nerf.\n\nStill, it could be a hard sell. It's hard for toys to compete these days.\n\nFourteen-year-old Jackson Roberts from Manhattan tried out the Nerf Rival. \"It's fun,\" he said. \"But I don't know how long I would play with this until I got bored.\" On Roberts' holiday wish list: a 3-D printer and a droid that takes pictures.'"

            "text": "\tThe Internet can be full of hateful comments and insults. To try to spread a little positivity, a little blue-faced robot wants you to know that you are \"more amazing than fresh towels from the dryer.\"\n\nOn Twitter, \"@TheNiceBot\" is a cheerful spambot that blurts a small dose of positivity into the Twitterverse. To create tweets, it sends a randomly generated compliment to a randomly selected Twitter user.\n\n## Cruel Comments Appear Every Minute\n\nThe NiceBot was created by anti-bullying organization Champions Against Bullying and the Deutsch advertising agency. The creators found out that a cruel or insulting comment is posted to Twitter every 60 seconds, so they designed the NiceBot. Every 36 seconds, it sends out messages filled with all the cheesy sweetness of an elementary school Valentine's Day card:\n\n\"@AmazingCinta I have a robot cavity, because you are so sweet. #TheNiceBot\"\n\n\"@usa2016election Calculating how incredible you are would require mathematical equations far more advanced than my programming. #TheNiceBot\"\n\n\"@OURHONEYFROOT Supernovas wish they were as bright as your smile. #TheNiceBot\"\n\n## A Three-Century Twitter Task?\n\nSome even sound slightly ... more-than-friends.\n\n\"@Lili_140803 My processors overheat when I think about how great you are. #TheNiceBot\"\n\n\"@ERlNxx Just thinking about you sends a positive surge through my circuits. #TheNiceBot\"\n\nThe NiceBot was launched on Oct. 1 with the mission to \"make the world a nicer place, one tweet at a time.\" So far, it has sent 52,000 tweets and attracted about 4,200 followers. It's programmed to eventually reach all 300 million Twitter users, a task that would take more than three centuries to accomplish. Of course, this optimistically assumes that Twitter will still be a thing in the 2300s.\n\nAlexandra Penn is the founder of Champions Against Bullying. She said that the organization, which works with kids, parents and educators in the U.S. and Canada, wanted to do something different to draw attention to online bullying.\n\n\"Last year, we created a public service announcement that called attention to teenagers who had been hurt by bullies,\" Penn said. \"This year, we wanted to combat the negativity of bullying with something more positive.\"\n\n## Adding Awareness Of Cyberbullying\n\nAt best, the NiceBot might be a helpful way to spread awareness of cyberbullying. At worst, it's a harmless, feel-good gimmick, said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and a professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University. Hinduja doubts the NiceBot will do much to get rid of hostile behavior online.\n\nNevertheless, he said he commends Champions Against Bullying at least a little for trying to spread positivity and make kindness go viral. The Internet can be a hateful place, and it could use more positivity.\n\nCyberbullying is devastating, particularly for kids and teens, because it feels so personal, Hinduja said. An insult, or a compliment, doesn't carry as much weight if it comes across as generic or insincere. This makes a spambot seem like a questionable choice for creating change online.\n\n## Bot's Tweets May Not Feel Real\n\nHinduja explained that when somebody says something kind, it feels genuine, and not like spam, because it's personal. A person can smile and be warm. On the other hand, a tweet that comes from someone with a \"bot\" username does not feel personal. Those who get these tweets are likely to dismiss them without much thought because they don't feel genuine, he said.\n\nDavid Weinberger is a researcher at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and writes about the effects that technology has on ideas. Apparently, he agrees:\n\n\"Thank you, (@TheNiceBot)! That means so little coming from a bot!\"\n\nHowever, plenty of other people seem to appreciate the NiceBot: It's \"a nice way to start the day,\" noted one pleased Twitter user. And even if the NiceBot can't possibly do much to make the digital landscape a safer or kinder place, it might inspire other, more effective ideas, said Hinduja.\n\n\"Instead of handing out a bracelet or a sticker, (Champions Against Bullying) is using programming to tap into social media networks in order to do something creative,\" he said. \"So I think that might be the take-home point. I don't know how much this is going to accomplish, but they tried, and there's something to be said about that.\"\n\nDespite an uphill battle, the NiceBot tweets on in cyberspace. It is a relentless digital cheerleader, trying again every 36 seconds. \n\n\"@Xzeynep_beyzaxx Thanks for just being you. #TheNiceBot\"'"

            "text": "\tMINNEAPOLIS - Business students at one college soon will have a new, more fun way to earn credits. But students won't learn from instructors - they'll learn by playing computer games.\n\nRasmussen College in Bloomington, Minnesota, is a for-profit college offering campus and online degree programs. Last week it announced that beginning in July it will offer game-based courses as part of its two-year associate degree in business management.\n\nRasmussen is calling the program Flex Choice. Officials say the new option will do more than inject some fun into a dry subject. It could also save students as much as $14,000 in tuition - almost half the cost of the associate degree.\n\nTo help design online business courses in the program, Rasmussen hired a gaming company, GarageGames.\n\n## Show What You Know\n\nIn some cases, students will play a series of games to show how well they've mastered the course material. Games will test how they use software typical at companies or handle customer complaints, for instance. If they ace the games, they get credit for the course.\n\n\"We know that games are fun,\" said Matthew Petz, vice president of academic affairs at Rasmussen. But research also suggests that they're also a good way to motivate students to learn. \"This is an innovative way to deliver the material.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new direction in education that not everyone supports. It's known as \"competency-based education.\" Instead of focusing as much on teaching, it aims more to measure \"outcomes\" - or what, exactly, the students have learned.\n\nThe idea, said Petz, is to allow students to \"show what they know.\" In some cases, it may allow students to complete their degrees more quickly.\n\nBut the gaming technology adds a new twist.\n\n## The Customer Loyalty Game\n\nIn one course, Customer Loyalty and Retention, students will play a computer game to test their ability to handle customer complaints. Faced with an unhappy caller, for example, they're asked to choose from a list of possible responses including: \"We don't do that, ma'am.\" Other responses might include \"I assure you we wouldn't try to trick you\" or \"I understand it can be confusing.\"\n\nDepending on the answers, the game rates their performance and gives feedback, said Timothy Loatman. He directs technology-based education services for Rasmussen.\n\n\"Mastering the game is certainly a way to prove and hone the skills,\" he said.\n\nThe Rasmussen plan, though, is likely to meet some doubts, in part because it eliminates the role of teachers from some of the courses. Instead of teachers, students will be assigned \"academic coaches.\" These coaches are not experts in the subject matter, according to Petz. Their job is to help support students in their independent study.\n\nDavid Weerts, a professor of higher education at the University of Minnesota, said that gaming technology can be useful for teaching some skills. But he said he was concerned about \"this kind of robotized new system.\" The risk, he said, is jumping into such a program without proof \"that people are gaining something from this.\"\n\n## \"Where Is The Teaching?\"\n\nNancy Black, an anthropology professor at Metro State University, was even more doubtful. \"Where is the teaching in this?\" said Black. She's president of a union of faculty professors from Minnesota state universities. Black questioned how a computer game could test a student's judgment skills, especially \"with no faculty whatsoever.\"\n\nRasmussen officials point out that students will have to take some \"faculty-led\" classes in order to earn their degree. They also say they tested the idea in a small pilot projects with 250 students. Starting in July, it will be offered as an option in one program, the Associate Degree in Business Management.\n\nBut Petz says the timing is right for this change. \"It really does cut time and money off a student's program,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that we build in those job-based skills that employers want, students want, and we've got to do it in a way that students can afford.\"'"

            "text": "\tNOME, Alaska - Jeff King is leading the pack and attempting to hold off other drivers - called mushers - in the last stages of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The annual race across nearly 1,000 miles of Alaska is won by the musher and team of dogs that reaches Nome first.\n\nMeanwhile, the town famous for the finish line is getting ready for the teams to come in. The finish line banner was set to be hung Monday morning in Nome.\n\nOn Sunday, city crews moved the actual finish line, the burled arch, into place. The city trucked in snow to give the mushers a path once they leave the Bering Sea ice.\n\n\"Yeah, I know, it's funny to see people dumping snow on a street instead of taking it off the street,\" said Greg Bill, the Iditarod's development director. \"To really dress it up and make it safe for the dog teams, we have to spread a layer of snow down for them to run on.\"\n\n## Last-Minute Preparations\n\nAbout 200 volunteers also have descended on Nome to make other last-minute preparations. They're getting the dog lot ready to receive teams, constructing the finish chute and prepping the souvenir stand.\n\nBill McCormick of Greensboro, N.C., volunteered for his first Iditarod in 1998. He's been back every year since.\n\n\"I like being part of putting something on,\" said the retired engineer whose job as a volunteer in Nome is to drug test the dogs. \"I enjoy the people. It's like family now.\"\n\nScott Hughes was helping hammer in the final nails at the finish line Sunday afternoon. The University of Pittsburgh student made his first trip to the Iditarod as part of a church group doing mission work.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Hughes said of his visit to Nome.\n\nKing, a four-time champion, was leading Aliy Zirkle by 20 minutes as the two arrived at the Elim checkpoint shortly before midnight Sunday.\n\n## Two Checkpoints To Go\n\nZirkle, a 44-year-old musher from Two Rivers, Alaska, led hours before when she arrived at the village of Koyuk, 171 miles east of Nome. She was one minute ahead of King on Sunday afternoon.\n\nKing rested his 12-dog team at the checkpoint for three hours and 42 minutes. Zirkle chose to let her 11 dogs take a break for three hours and 44 minutes. King departed Koyuk at 5:50 p.m. and arrived in Elim at 11:27 p.m. Zirkle got back on the trail at 5:51 p.m. and made it into Elim at 11:47 p.m., race officials said.\n\nKing last won in 2006 and is trying to be only the second musher to win five races.\n\nZirkle has come in second place in the last two years. She is seeking to become only the third woman to win the race. And she would be the first woman to win since the late Susan Butcher in 1990.\n\nOther front-runners Sunday were four-time champion Martin Buser, who arrived in Koyuk in third place at 4:20 p.m. Sunday. He was followed 13 minutes later by 2012 Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey. Veteran musher Sonny Lindner arrived in fifth place at 4:47 p.m. Defending champion Mitch Seavey, father of Dallas Seavey, followed at 5:23 p.m.\n\nThe racers are expected to begin arriving in Nome no later than Tuesday. They have two more checkpoints before Nome.\n\nTemperatures in Nome hovered slightly above zero Sunday, which brought clear skies and brilliant sunshine. Snowfall has been light this winter in the frontier town of nearly 3,700, so the city has been stockpiling snow. It was being trucked to Front Street for the final stretch to the finish line.\n\n## Fan Plans To Come Back\n\nWhat little snow was on the ground, along with the cooler temperatures, were welcomed by fan Nina Cross of Brandon, Miss. She attended the start of the race last year in Anchorage, fell in love with the event, and decided she needed to see the finish in person, too.\n\nShe said she remembers as a child reading about the 1925 serum run. Serum is a form of medicine. In 1925, it was being used to treat the contagious infection diphtheria. After an outbreak of diphtheria, 20 mushers and 150 sled dogs traveled over 600 miles to deliver diphtheria serum to Nome. They rescued that town and neighboring ones from the epidemic.\n\n\"Nome was this mystical destination, and it never occurred to me that I would get there some day. So, for me to be here is a real event in my life,\" she said.\n\nAnd she loves the dogs.\n\n\"Any dogs that can laugh when they run, with their tongues hanging out, they got my heart right now,\" said Cross, who just learned about the volunteer programs. She is already making plans to be back in Nome next year.\n\nThe race began March 2 in Willow, near Anchorage, with 69 teams. As of late Sunday morning, 16 mushers had scratched, leaving 53 teams on the trail. Long stretches of bare and rocky ground made for an icy, treacherous trail in the early part of the race.\n\nThe first to reach Nome receives $50,000 and a new truck. The 29 teams after that win cash prizes decreasing on a sliding scale. All other teams finishing the race receive $1,049.'"

            "text": "\tParents whose children play school sports are required to pay various fees in order to cover some of the costs of sports programs. A newly released survey suggests that this system may be causing a serious problem. If parents feel unable to pay the fees, children who want to play sports may not be able to. As a result, the children's long-term health may suffer.\n\nThe newly released survey is known as the National Poll on Children's Health, and was conducted in June of last year.\n\n## Income Linked To Health?\n\nThe survey seems to support the idea that there is a link between income and health. It found that 51 percent of higher-income families reported having a child in sports. Yet, only 30 percent of lower-income families had a child playing school sports.\n\n\"Sports is one way that kids can be physically active in an enjoyable way,\" said Sarah Clark, an expert on children's health. \"They're with their buddies. They're learning teamwork.\"\n\nPlaying sports is certainly good for children's long-term health. For example, regular exercise helps prevent kids from putting on too much weight. Being very overweight, or obese, can cause serious health problems including heart problems and diabetes.\n\nThe survey found that the cost of playing sports is keeping many children from participating. One in 7 parents whose children were not playing sports said cost was a reason. In addition, fees seem to be becoming a bigger factor in discouraging sports participation.\n\n## Poor Participation Rates\n\nSports participation among low-income students was 10 percent lower than it was in 2012. Even among students from higher-income households, participation has dropped. Nearly 1 in 10 parents said their child had become less involved in sports because of the cost. In 2012, only half that number of parents - 1 in 20 - said that.\n\nOther factors may affect participation in school sports, Clark said. For example, some families choose to have kids play in community leagues rather than school teams.\n\nOverall, however, the results of the survey are troubling. Schools and parent groups do try to help reduce costs for low-income students who show an interest in playing sports, Clark said. Yet they may fail to consider students who never bother to try out for a team because they know cost will be an obstacle.\n\n## That's Expensive!\n\nThe poll found the average school sports participation fee was $126 per child. However, some parents paid more than $400 for their children's participation, particularly when costs for equipment and travel were included.\n\nClark is the mother of two boys who played several different high school sports. As a result, she knows about the cost of sports participation first-hand.\n\nOne year, she said, \"I remember I hit $1,000 in fees before Christmas.\"'"

            "text": "\tJIM THORPE, Pa. - Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe had [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) and European ancestry. When he died in 1953 at the age of 64, his children held a traditional Indian burial on the Sac and Fox Reservation in Oklahoma. Mourners shared a meal as the great athlete's body lay in full view inside a lodge.\n\nThe ceremony came to an abrupt halt when Thorpe's widow barged in. Patsy Thorpe, his third wife, was accompanied by state troopers and a funeral hearse. She seized the famous sportsman's body and drove away.\n\n\"It was a complete shock to all of us,\" recalls William Thorpe, the athlete's 85-year-old son, who was there that day. \"We are all set to bury Dad in Oklahoma and then - boom! - he was gone, never to be returned.\"\n\nPatsy Thorpe had cut a deal with two struggling towns in Pennsylvania called Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk. They agreed that if the towns merged, renamed themselves Jim Thorpe and built a memorial for him, she would present them with his remains for burial. The Olympian had never set foot in the town.\n\n## \"Time For My Dad To Come Home\"\n\nThorpe was born in Oklahoma in 1888 and raised on the Sac and Fox Reservation. William Thorpe says the town of Jim Thorpe has done a wonderful job caring for his father's grave for 60 years, but now it's \"time for my dad to come home.\"\n\nWilliam Thorpe, his brother and the Sac and Fox Nation won a lawsuit in April. The lawsuit demanded that the town return his father's body to the reservation. A federal judge ruled that the town had to return the body to Oklahoma under rules than govern Indian human remains and other artifacts.\n\nThe town of Jim Thorpe appealed the decision and is now defending itself. \"People in this town are determined to keep our memorial, and keep the body here,\" says Mayor Michael Sofranko. \"We've done nothing wrong. We've done nothing but honor Jim Thorpe all these years.\"\n\nThe grave site rests on soil from Oklahoma and the Olympic stadium in Stockholm, Sweden. Thorpe won gold medals in the decathlon and pentathlon in Stockholm in 1912. He also played professional football and baseball in the United States.\n\nIn his prime, Thorpe's fame was similar to that of quarterback Peyton Manning or Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps today.\n\n## Townspeople Adore The Athlete\n\nThe athlete's full name was James Francis Thorpe. He is buried in his favorite white buckskin jacket. The memorial overlooks a grassy slope featuring statues saluting his varied career. Tributes are inscribed on the monuments and the stone building that holds his body.\n\nOne of the inscriptions is a comment to Thorpe from King Gustav V of Sweden at the Olympic medal ceremony. It reads: \"Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete.\" Thorpe supposedly replied, \"Thanks, King.\"\n\nAnne Marie Fitzpatrick, 72, runs a downtown gift shop in Jim Thorpe, Pa. In her store there is a glass jar stuffed with cash with a sign that says \"Keep Jim Thorpe In Jim Thorpe.\" Fitzpatrick has set up several donation jars around town to raise money for the appeal. \"He's been here 59 years, and we're not about to give him up,\" Fitzpatrick explains.\n\nFitzpatrick was in grade school when Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk merged. She has helped organize an annual Jim Thorpe birthday ceremony in May at the memorial for many years.\n\nIt is difficult for outsiders to understand the adoration for the athlete from the townspeople of Jim Thorpe. After all, their only connection to him is his name. But many have raised money over the years to put up statues of the athlete. There is now a $60,000 statue of Thorpe throwing a discus and a $50,000 statue of him running with a football. Fundraising is underway to add a baseball statue.\n\n## Thorpe Grandsons Stand With Town\n\nNot all of the athlete's family agree that his body should be taken to Oklahoma. \"The town was built around my grandpa - people revere him,\" says John Thorpe, 56. John is a grandson who lives in California. He has joined with another grandson to fight their uncles and tribe in an effort to keep Jim Thorpe in Jim Thorpe.\n\nMike Koehler, 75, thinks the town has honored his grandfather's memory well. \"For God's sake, leave him alone,\" he says. John Thorpe and Koehler have traveled here for years to take part in Jim Thorpe celebrations. They point out that Oklahoma could have kept Thorpe in 1953 but passed on the chance.\n\nAfter Thorpe's death, his widow and Oklahoma's governor agreed on a deal for the state to build a grave site and memorial. But after funding was approved, the governor abruptly changed his mind and dropped the plans.\n\nPatsy Thorpe was furious and began, in the words of William Thorpe, \"shopping my dad's body around the country.\" She first traveled to Philadelphia. There she tried but failed to persuade the commissioner of the National Football League to pay for a grave site and memorial. Thorpe did not just play football. He was also the NFL's first president.\n\nWilliam Thorpe says his stepmother also failed to enlist Carlisle, Pa. This town was home to Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where Thorpe excelled in football and track. Thorpe was sent to the boarding school at age 16 by his father to learn a trade.\n\nWhile in Philadelphia, Patsy Thorpe saw a news story about Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk holding fundraisers to save the depressed towns. She contacted town leaders and made the deal that brought the towns a new name and Jim Thorpe's body. '"

            "title": "Sweet welcome home: Rams football team returns to L.A. for 2016 season",
            "text": "b\"HOUSTON, Texas - For 21 years, Los Angeles, California, has not had its own professional football team. Many have tried to bring a team to the county, but one plan after another has collapsed. \n\nNow, at last, the wait is over. On Tuesday a group of National Football League owners voted to allow the St. Louis Rams to leave Missouri and move to Los Angeles for the 2016 season. The owners also voted to give the San Diego Chargers an option to join the Rams in Inglewood, a city in the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Rams' new home will be on the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood. It will be the league's biggest stadium. Due to open in 2019, it could end up costing as much as $3 billion.\n\nThe NFL owners met in a hotel to vote on rival proposals. In finding a way to return professional football to Los Angeles, they succeeded where a succession of local leaders and billionaires had failed.\n\nThe owners voted on two proposals. Both involved relocating two teams to cities in Los Angeles County, with both sets of teams to share a newly built stadium. One proposed plan was to move the Chargers and the Oakland Raiders to Carson. The other plan was to move the Rams and a team to be determined to Inglewood. \n\n## Chargers Are Likely Partner For Rams\n\nIn the end, the Inglewood proposal won out, 30-2\\\\. The Chargers were named as the team likely to share the new stadium with the Rams.\n\nForging the deal meant bringing together Rams owner Stan Kroenke and Chargers owner Dean Spanos. Spanos previously favored the Carson plan, and the two men had resisted a partnership for the better part of last year.\n\nDevelopers envision transforming the 298-acre Inglewood site into a multibillion-dollar entertainment, shopping and housing site. The stadium and a performing arts venue will be the centerpiece of the site.\n\nThe new stadium will have 70,240 seats. For large events, it will also be able to add an extra 30,000 people in standing-room-only areas.\n\nIn addition to regular season games, the stadium is expected to host special events such as college basketball's Final Four and the NFL Pro Bowl. Designers plan to make the building 175 feet tall.\n\n## Temporary Home In Coliseum\n\nThe design calls for a roof with an area over the playing field made of a strong transparent material. The stadium will be open on the sides, to let in air.\n\nUntil the stadium is complete, the Rams are expected to play temporarily at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. If the Chargers join them, it is unclear where they will play, though the NFL says Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Rose Bowl are all possible choices.\n\nIn the last several days, fellow owners worked behind the scenes to bring Kroenke and Spanos together. Their new agreement allows them to be equal partners in the Inglewood stadium. Right now, the only shared stadium in the NFL is in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which is home to the New York Giants and Jets.\n\nThe NFL's long absence from Los Angeles was not for lack of trying. There were dozens of proposals for new stadiums, to be built in a range of locations throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties.\n\n## Multiple Plans, Without Success\n\nThere were numerous plans for stadiums in downtown Los Angeles, none of which got off the ground. As the failed plans piled up, the city's quest became so seemingly hopeless that the NFL's return to the city became a running joke. \n\nFour mayors and numerous other political leaders tried to bring football back to Los Angeles, with no luck. There were plans by high-powered businessmen such as Eli Broad, Peter O'Malley, Ed Roski and Casey Wasserman. Even stars like Garth Brooks, Tom Cruise and Magic Johnson lent their names to various failed efforts.\n\nOver two years, more than half the league's 32 teams were linked to plans to move to Los Angeles.\n\n## Momentum Changed With Land Purchase\n\nThings finally changed in January 2014, when Kroenke bought 60 acres of land for an estimated $101 million next to 238 acres of the Hollywood Park site. The Hollywood Park site is owned by San Francisco-based developer Stockbridge Capital. \n\nLater in 2014, Kroenke and Stockbridge Capital agreed to combine their properties and work together on a mixed-used development with the stadium at the center. The site's developers say between 125 and 150 architects have been working full-time since mid-2014 on the stadium project. The plan was designed by the architectural firm HKS Inc.\n\nAll of the site's previous structures have been demolished except for the casino. Even that building will be torn down once its replacement is finished nearby. \n\nDevelopers have said stadium construction can start as quickly as two weeks after they receive league approval.\""

            "title": "Chasing a Cleveland championship: LeBron James back in a Cavs jersey",
            "text": "\tIn 1910, a year after leaving the White House, Theodore Roosevelt delivered a timeless speech in Paris, France.\n\nThe former president said that many people like to criticize, but it is better to try and fail than never try at all.\n\n\"It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better,\" Roosevelt said. \"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood ... If he fails, at least (he) fails while daring greatly.\"\n\nBasketball superstar LeBron James used Roosevelt's speech as a map to guide his way back home to Ohio.\n\n## Where He Got His Start\n\nOn July 12, James, who had been playing for the Miami Heat, signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team where he got his start. James, who is 29, was quickly back in in his familiar No. 23 Cavaliers basketball jersey.\n\nJames thought about Roosevelt's words during and after the 2010-2011 basketball season, his first in Miami, where he was heavily criticized for joining the team. In Miami, James posted them on his locker in large letters. Basketball insiders believe James went back to help get the Cavaliers their first championship.\n\n\"He left (Cleveland) to win a championship and he won multiple championships,\" said James Jones, one of James' closest basketball allies. \"He left to compete on the highest level.\" The Miami team went on to win two National Basketball Association (NBA) championships. The only thing missing for him, Jones said, was the chance to win a championship in his hometown.\n\n\"LeBron is very driven and he takes that challenge seriously,\" Jones said. \"He feels that he's equipped and he's in this place, in this time, to be able to do it. He's taking it on. Even if it's not what other people thought or expected, he expects to be the guy to bring a championship to Cleveland.\"\n\nJames, who was born in Akron, Ohio, said he purposefully sacrificed success in Miami for the hope of success in Cleveland. While he was playing for Miami, the team won two championships. Cleveland has never won even one.\n\n## Sports Fans In City Celebrate\n\n\"What's funny is the team was a small [part] of me coming back,\" James said. \"It had nothing much to do with the team. It was more about these fans and the city and the people here and the people who watched me grow from when I first picked up a basketball at age 8 to now at 29.\"\n\nRoosevelt was one of the most powerful and influential leaders of the early 20th century. James is one of the most powerful and best known players of the 21st century sports world. In Cleveland, the Cavaliers sold out of season tickets the same day he announced his return.\n\nOn July 11, James released an essay announcing his intention to return to the Cavaliers. Immediately, the sleepy lunch crowd inside Harry Buffalo sports bar exploded. They celebrated as if the Cavs had already won a championship.\n\nThe night James left Cleveland, \"people in here were running into the streets crying and screaming,\" Harry Buffalo General Manager Caitlin Cassidy said. \"When he announced he was coming back, people did not go back to work.\"\n\n\"There are not many players who can come in that young and understand the (importance) of what he stands for and what he brings\" to the team and the city, said Dallas Mavericks basketball player Tyson Chandler. He won a gold medal in basketball with James during the 2012 London Olympics. \"With that comes a lot of responsibility and he's never (avoided) it.\"\n\nSome players don't like to play for their hometown team, but James is embracing it.\n\n\"It takes a special player to be able to do that,\" said Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd. \"But if there is someone who can do it, he can.\"\n\n## \"The Hardest Thing You Can Ever Do\"\n\nThere was a time when James was obsessed with winning a title and foolishly proclaimed the Heat would win \"not five, not six, not seven\" championships. That was before he truly understood how difficult it was to win just one.\n\n\"It's the hardest thing you can ever do in your basketball career,\" James says now.\n\nJames stopped caring how others viewed his career about the time he started listening to the words of Roosevelt's speech.\n\n\"I know deep down he really wants to bring a championship back to his hometown,\" Chandler said.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure that's why he came back. He felt like it was the right thing to do and clearly that's what he's chasing,\" he said.\n\nTo use Roosevelt's words, the dust is on James' face, and the sweat is on his brow. The most powerful man in the NBA will soon discover whether he's strong enough to carry his hometown team to glory.'"

            "title": "If math hurts your brain, try these lessons instead",
            "text": "\tSAN JOSE, Calif. - Do you hate math? Relax - the problem may not be you. It could just be the way math is taught.\n\nHaving trouble with math should not be seen as a personal failure or as the result of a missing gene. Instead, it is likely the result of wrongheaded \"one-size-fits-all\" ways of teaching. So, at least, runs the theory behind a new approach to math education that is exciting teachers nationwide.\n\nMore and more math instructors are embracing ideas developed by Stanford professors Carol Dweck and Jo Boaler. Their approach includes more visual and creative exercises. It favors discussions of ideas over a focus on memorization and speed. In place of the one-size-fits-all approach, it offers individually tailored lessons.\n\n## Math Is About Hard Work And Practice\n\nDavid Foster of the Silicon Valley Mathematics Initiative said that for many people math class was a bad experience. He says if that if you tell people you teach math, they all \"launch into a horror story about high school math. The only mystery is if they blame the algebra teacher or the geometry teacher\" for their hatred of math.\n\nFoster believes a more positive approach to math instruction is the way to get kids to love learning.\n\n\"Learning to do math is no different from learning to play the piano or learning to play a sport,\" he said. \"A lot of it is about hard work and practice,\" rather than a natural ability that only some have.\n\nHis thinking is rooted in the ideas of Dweck and Boaler, whose approaches to teaching math are spreading quickly. Dweck argues that math education should focus on helping students persevere even if they do not succeed at first. She says failure helps students to learn, grow and get better.\n\n## But It Hurts My Brain\n\nBoaler offered a free online math course last summer that attracted 85,000 people. Her approach involves less memorization - instead, lessons focus on different ways to solve problems and on the uses of math in everyday life. Lessons are tailored to individual levels and feature small-group discussion.\n\n\"We're in a crisis in math,\" Boaler said. \"These poor kids are given the idea that math is about performance, and then they get the idea that they can't do it.\"\n\nAs sixth-grader Sahib Dokal put it: \"It feels like you have to do it faster and I can't think that hard.\"\n\nTeachers say that bad classroom experiences with math have led to math failure. Just 36 percent of U.S. eighth-graders score at their grade level on national math tests.\n\n## Mixed-Level Classwork Seems To Work\n\nTo underline the importance of effort, the Khan Academy - an educational organization that provides free education through YouTube video lectures - has launched a math contest that recognizes not just mastery, but effort as well. It posts weekly scores online and so far has attracted 41,000 students from the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\"I thought I would bring a little more excitement to my students,\" said David Hicks of San Francisco 49ers Academy in East Palo Alto. His school was in first place in effort after the contest's first week last month.\n\nThe contest tallies student progress in mastering Khan Academy lessons. A computer program analyzes each student's work and tailors lessons to their level. Thus, Hicks said, in his mixed-level class, \"my algebra students don't have to wait for my students who are at a third-grade ability.\" Khan's \"dashboard\" shows each student's progress, level and effort.\n\n\"When I complete it, it makes me feel smart,\" 49ers eighth-grader Fernando Ibarra said.\n\n## Math Making Sense\n\nOnline tools do not work for everyone, however. Ana Wallace, a senior at Summit Rainier in San Jose, finds Khan's video lessons confusing. \"You can't ask Khan questions,\" she said, and the daily 30 minutes on Algebra II just get her more confused.\n\nThere are other approaches, such as talking through a math problem step by step. At the 49ers Academy, Hicks will often pose a puzzle-like question, then illustrate on the whiteboard students' step-by-step thinking as they solve the problem.\n\nHowever, much of what makes math more understandable comes down to just good teaching: keeping track of each student and not leaving anyone confused.\n\nMichelle Rojas, 12, said she hated math in elementary school. When she asked a question, teachers \"explained it in their own college way, instead of for the grade level you were in,\" she said. Now a sixth-grader at Alpha Blanca Alvarado Middle School in San Jose, she is understanding lessons better.\n\nTeachers and students say that relating math to everyday problem-solving and daily life is also important.\n\n\"The more you can connect the math to their life,\" the better, said math teacher Mona Keeler. It makes it meaningful and \"takes off that pressure.\"\n\n## \"We Can Have Kids Loving Math\"\n\nWhat is the evidence that these new ways work? For one thing, there are plenty of stories from teachers themselves.\n\n\"I've seen humongous growth\" in math achievement, Keeler said.\n\nSo can everyone learn trigonometry and calculus with the right kind of teaching?\n\n\"Most of humanity is capable,\" Khan Academy founder Salman Khan said firmly.\n\nWhat about those with a math-learning disability?\n\n\"It's hard to know who's born with a math disability, or who becomes disabled because of the way they've been treated in math,\" Boaler said. \"I know we can transform it. We can have kids loving math.\"'"

            "text": "\tAlex Rodriguez's fall from the ranks of baseball royalty hit bottom on Aug. 5. Major League Baseball suspended him for using performance enhancing substances. The ban covers 211 games - the rest of this season and the entire 2014 campaign.\n\nRodriguez was once expected to become baseball's all-time home run king. Now, he will forever be remembered as the central figure in one of the game's worst scandals.\n\nTwelve other players were given 50-game suspensions. They all had a connection with Biogenesis, the Miami-area clinic that provided players with banned substances from 2009 until last year. The League says the New York Yankees slugger was one of them.\n\nRodriguez, 38, is a three-time most valuable player (MVP) and fifth on the all-time home-run list. He can still suit up and play while he appeals the ban. The announcement came as Rodriguez returned to the big-league lineup after months of rehab for a serious hip injury.\n\n## All-Stars Caught In Probe\n\n\"The past seven months have been a nightmare - probably the worst time of my life,'' the third baseman and Miami native said. His voice cracked as he spoke about returning to the game during a news conference in Chicago.\n\n\"I am thrilled and humbled to have an opportunity to put on this uniform again and to play Major League Baseball again,\" he said.\n\nThe League's announcement on Monday ended a lengthy and hard-hitting probe. MLB offered to pay witnesses to help gather evidence against players suspected of cheating. Ultimately, it persuaded the clinic's founder, Anthony Bosch, to cooperate.\n\nBosch turned over material including emails, ledgers and phone records, that allegedly confirmed ballplayers were doping in violation of the players' labor contract. Most of the evidence has not been made public.\n\nThe case also caught All-Stars Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and Everth Cabrera. Some are calling the punishments the most sweeping since the 1919 Black Sox scandal, which involved a scheme to rig the World Series.\n\n\"We pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do,\" Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said.\n\n## \"I'm Fighting For My Life\"\n\nMost of the players negotiated the terms of their suspensions over the past month. They chose to admit responsibility, sit out their suspensions immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.\n\nRodriguez had vowed from the beginning to fight the allegations.\n\n\"I'm in the toughest fight of my life and it's not going to get easier,'' he said Monday. \"I'm fighting for my life.''\n\nHe declined to answer questions about the use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). In the past, he has said he had not used PEDs since his days as a Texas Ranger.\n\nThe League says that he kept using testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH), however. Testosterone is a hormone and HGH is a protein. Athletes take both to try to build muscle, but both have potentially dangerous side affects, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nRodriguez's punishment was also based on his effort to cover-up and obstruct baseball's investigation, the League said.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami last week said it was conducting a criminal investigation into the clinic. It is looking at the possible illegal sale and distribution of drugs, including to high school athletes. It is possible that Rodriguez and other players could be made to testify before a grand jury, if the case rises to that level.\n\n## A $275 Million Contract\n\nRodriguez has a $275 million contract and is the highest-paid player in baseball. He previously admitted taking PEDs when he played for the Rangers in 2001-03. This was after the results of a confidential drug test were leaked. But has never been disciplined.\n\nRich Hofmann, Rodriguez's high school coach at Westminster Christian in Miami, said it was a sad day. \"Each one of us, depending on where we are in our lives, have decisions to make and we have to live with them. Unfortunately, he has to live with his and that will be\" what he is remembered for.\n\nRodriguez had been rehabbing with a Yankees minor league team until Monday's call-up to the majors. He accused MLB and the Yankees of trying to end his career so that the team won't have to pay him the balance of his contract, estimated at about $60 million.\n\nThough the players union has helped the MLB in its effort to clean up the sport, Executive Director Michael Weiner said the union would defend Rodriguez. Weiner said Selig did not \"act appropriately'' in his case, but did not elaborate.\n\nThe scandal broke in late January. One of Bosch's partners, Porter Fischer, went to Miami New Times with records containing the names of major leaguers and other athletes who were buying steroids, testosterone and other prescription-only substances from the clinic. After the newspaper published the story, the League launched an all-out effort to build cases against the players.\n\nOther players who received 50-game suspensions in addition to Cabrera, Cruz and Peralta were: Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Antonio Bastardo and New York Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli.\n\nThe latest suspensions follow the July 22 ban of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, who was suspended for the rest of this season.'"

            "text": "\tLOS ANGELES - From their office window, Rajiv Maheswaran and Yu-Han Chang can catch a glimpse of Staples Center. It's the home arena to both the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers basketball teams.\n\nTo see the future of the NBA, they only have to turn their heads. Whiteboards inside their office are filled with algorithms in red, blue and green. Algorithms are a set of steps computers use to solve problems. Programmers in the office sit around computers typing lines of code.\n\nWhat resembles gibberish to anyone without a degree in computer science could help NBA teams find the best ways to grab rebounds and defend pick and rolls through a proprietary software system developed by Maheswaran and Chang. The researchers from USC's Viterbi School of Engineering are the NBA's newest go-to guys. For the first time this season, motion-tracking cameras will placed in every arena.\n\nTheir software can distill the oceans of numbers that will be available. \"It's 1,000 times more information than anyone had before,\" said Maheswaran.\n\n## From Computer Screen To Hardwood\n\nOn his laptop screen, Maheswaran displayed visual tools that teams could use to tweak lineups and position players for the best results. One showed a basketball court covered with squares. The darkest squares show the most likely spots where a rebound would fall depending on the shot taken. Another tool showed players' success rates in moves on offense.\n\nEven the biggest supporters of these types of numbers admit that it should be only one part of a how a team makes decisions. Traditionally, teams looked at game films and evaluations of players.\n\nBut the system Maheswaran and Chang have licensed to four NBA teams through their company, Second Spectrum, could influence how basketball is played. It might even change which players are put on a team.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors used a similar system last season to help the team defend against three-point shots. Assistant general manager Kirk Lacob said the team checked its lineups and levels of fatigue of players and made tweaks. It worked: teams no longer shredded the Warriors' outside defense.\n\n\"Did it make 100 percent of the difference, 50 percent of the difference, 20 percent of the difference?\" said Lacob, whose team worked with a California company called MOCAP Analytics. \"I don't know the answer. The most important thing is it did help us identify a problem and then eventually correct it.\"\n\nThe use of this kind of info in the NBA is about 10 years behind its use in Major League Baseball. One reason is that baseball is slower and easier to study. Figuring out the same thing with basketball requires newer technology.\n\n## Recording Every Movement On The Court\n\nSix NBA teams used cameras that track motion in the 2010-11 season. Last season, 15 teams used the system.\n\nThe NBA recently decided to pay for every team to have the system. That would allow the information to be available to the whole league. Some information could be shared with fans on NBA TV and NBA.com.\n\nIt all starts with six tiny cameras placed in the rafters of each NBA arena. They will record the movement of every player, referee and the ball 25 times a second. The info is electronically transmitted to a company to be put into groups by passes, dribbles, and shots, for instance.\n\nTeams can get relatively simple information such as the number of passes to a certain spot on the court while games are in progress. More complicated information will be available after the game when more information is processed.\n\nSeveral teams have also hired employees to help sift through the information. \"Every team is going to have their own formula that they will create that works for their team,\" Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.\n\nBut, all these stats may only result in a handful of numbers coaches pass on to players.\n\n\"You can't give players a boatload of information,\" Los Angeles Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis said. They can't immediately put it to use when they play, he said.\n\n## Information Overload For Players?\n\nPlayers are conflicted about the value of the info: like, which players prefer to shoot after just two dribbles.\n\nSaid Clippers point guard Chris Paul: \"If I just guard him and after two dribbles I stop, and he takes a third and I say, 'Hey, man, you're only supposed to take two dribbles,' then what? It's cool, but you have to play.\"\n\nThere's also the data fatigue factor. Lakers center Chris Kaman said he was often overloaded with numbers last season when he played for Dallas.\n\n\"It got a little bit annoying,\" he said, \"hearing about it all the time - this number and that number.\" Such as? \"Points per possession, per second half, per first quarter ... this guy guarding this guy in this game or these five guys did good against these guys but not these guys. There's everything.\"\n\nIncluding information related to injuries. The Lakers will be able to track Kobe Bryant's rate of movement when he returns from a torn Achilles tendon, as well as how much weight he's putting on his legs during games. That information could help the team's trainers create practice plans that keep him healthy for the rest of the season.\n\nThis new info can also be used by teams when they discuss contracts with players.\n\nMaheswaran, 39, and Chang, 35, hope more teams leave the number crunching to them.\n\nThe duo has worked together since 2005. They have completed projects for the Department of Defense involving the movement of vehicles and mobile devices. Chang says that it's great that they can go from \"detecting enemy targets and tracking them to tracking our favorite players on the court.\"'"

            "text": "\tA group is asking the NCAA to require schools to interview minorities and other people of color for head coaching and leadership positions.\n\nThe National Association for Coaching Equity and Development (NAFCED) is an organization that represents minority coaches. It is joining longtime equality crusader Richard Lapchick in lobbying for what it is calling an \"Eddie Robinson Rule.\" Robinson was the revered coach at Grambling State University in Louisiana who died in 2007\\\\. He was the NCAA Division 1 coach who won the most games ever.\n\nA Robinson rule would be college athletics' version of the NFL's well-known Rooney Rule. It requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coach and other high-profile positions.\n\nThe group says colleges consistently exclude minorities from top positions on teams.\n\n## Number Of Minority Coaches Shrinking\n\nMerritt Norvell is the NAFCED's executive director. He said Friday that there are plenty of qualified minority coaches. \"It's about the hiring process, which has historically and systematically excluded minority coaches by denying them an opportunity to compete in the process.\"\n\nNAFCED was formed last year to fight the shrinking number of minority coaches in college sports. Well-known members include Texas Tech University basketball coach Tubby Smith and Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson III. University of Texas coach Shaka Smart also belongs to the organization.\n\nLapchick runs the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida. Before the college football season began, his organization released a study. It reported that 87.5 percent of the 128 head football coaches in the NCAA's Division 1 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) were white. That includes all four teams that made it to the playoffs. They are University of Alabama, Clemson University, University of Oklahoma and Michigan State University.\n\nNearly 80 percent of FBS college presidents and athletic directors are white males.\n\n## \"We Need A Lot Of Different Ideas\"\n\nLapchick has long wanted the NCAA to make a rule similar to the NFL's rule. Lapchick called the endorsement from NAFCED \"an enormous boost.\"\n\n\"I think what has been lacking is a forceful group of prominent sports leaders backing this,\" Lapchick said. \"This organization has the potential to have an impact on their own campuses as well as the NCAA.\"\n\n\"I do think for the health of the game we need diversity,\" said Paul Hewitt. He is a former coach at Georgia Tech and George Mason University. \"It's vitally important. We're going through a very critical stage here and we need a lot of different ideas, a lot of different thoughts, a lot of different perspectives so we can arrive at the best place for the game and the kids who play the game.\"\n\nThe question will be whether the NCAA can make so many public and private colleges follow the rule.\n\n## Activist Wants Federal Law Instead\n\nNorvell said the public would help put pressure on the schools. Lapchick said public pressure is not enough. He wants Congress to make it a law. He said a government law would have a greater effect than an NCAA rule.\n\nNorries Wilson is an assistant coach at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He led Columbia University's football team from 2006 to 2011, becoming its first black coach. He said a rule about minorities could make a big difference.\n\n\"I don't want anyone to get a job because he's a minority,\" Wilson said. \"I want the most qualified person to get the job. But I think it's important for minorities to get an opportunity to sit down with athletic directors and the (school) president and state their case for why they are the person to run a given program.\"\n\nNAFCED held its first meeting in Atlanta, Georgia last summer. At the time, Hewitt, who is African-American, was initially reluctant to push for the rule. He was concerned that people might think he was supporting it only because he was recently fired by George Mason University and was looking for a new job. As time went on, he said his viewpoint changed. He said that basketball and football are held to a different standard than sports such as baseball and hockey.\n\n\"We don't have enough diversity of thought that goes into rules, regulations and how we market the game, quite frankly,\" Hewitt said. \"Now more than ever, there is a need for it.\"'"

            "text": "\tCHICAGO - On Tuesday, a federal agency opened a hearing to decide whether college athletes should be allowed to form a union. Northwestern University quarterback Kain Colter testified at the hearing for the pro-union side, saying that he was essentially paid to play football through his scholarship money.\n\nIf approved, it would be the first union for college athletes in U.S. history. Workers organize unions so they can bargain together as a large group. The idea is that they would have more power to demand better pay and working conditions.\n\nColter characterized playing college football as a job. He said schools make it clear to incoming players that athletics are more important than academics - that is, classwork.\n\nColter, a co-founder of the newly formed College Athletes Players Association, said players have exhausting schedules. During and before the football season, he said, they devote 40 to 50 hours a week to the game. And during August training, players often start practice at 8 a.m. and finish at 10 p.m.\n\n## Union Bid A Test Case\n\n\"It's a job, there is no way around it - it's a job,\" said Colter, a 21-year-old senior. Colter's own college football career is now over.\n\nAsked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded that it was in order for him \"to play football. To perform an athletic service.\" Later, he said players earn the money, in part, \"by sacrificing our bodies.\"\n\nWhether the players qualify under federal law as employees is the core question for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB is the federal agency that protects the rights of workers to join together.\n\nIf the college athletes are deemed employees, they would have rights to unionize. Whatever ruling the panel makes can be appealed.\n\nThe bid to form a union is seen as a test case that could completely change how college athletics operates. The NCAA and Big Ten Conference, which includes Northwestern, both argue that student athletes are not employees.\n\n## \"Not A Football Factory\"\n\nDuring his opening statement, a lawyer representing the university, Alex Barbour, insisted classwork is at the center of a football player's college experience. \"Northwestern is not a football factory,\" he said.\n\nBut during his testimony, Colter said he abandoned his hopes of entering a pre-med program, which would have prepared him for medical school. He blamed Northwestern for demanding so much time from its football players. He said chemistry was always offered at times that conflicted with football practice.\n\n\"You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics,\" he said. \"You have to sacrifice one. But we can't sacrifice football. ... We are brought to the university to play football.\"\n\nDevoting more time to classwork at the expense of his football, he added, could result in the loss of a scholarship. Asked if coaches ever told players to leave practice and go study, Colter said no.\n\nNorthwestern spokesman Bob Rowley declined to comment on Colter's suggestion that the school treated football as more important than classwork. He said the university's own witnesses later this week could address that and other questions.\n\n## College Athletics Draws In Billions\n\nThe university has repeatedly pointed out that Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for football teams in the country - around 97 percent of players receive degrees.\n\nColter said most of the team's 85 scholarship players support forming a union, though he has been the only one to step forward publicly. He did so with the support of the United Steelworkers union, the players association and its leader, former UCLA linebacker Ramogi Huma. Huma was also expected to testify, possibly on Wednesday.\n\nSupporters say a union would provide athletes means to push for laws to ensure their safety and ability to provide for themselves. They noted that players are left out of the billions of dollars that college athletics draws in. They claim their scholarships sometimes don't even cover livings expenses for a full year.\n\nA decision by the NLRB could come soon after the testimony concludes.\n\nFor now, the push to form unions for athletes is just at private schools, like Northwestern. Public universities, which follow different regulations, could follow later.'"

            "title": "NFL urged to crack down on players who hurt women",
            "text": "\tNASHVILLE, Tenn. - Domestic violence - violence directed against wives or girlfriends - is a serious problem in professional sports. Many people, though, feel that the punishment usually doesn't fit the crime.\n\nTake the case of Ravens running back Ray Rice. The football player is sitting out just two games for a serious offense: allegedly beating his girlfriend into unconsciousness. For Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon, meanwhile, smoking pot may lead to a far harsher punishment - a yearlong ban.\n\nCritics of the way the National Football League (NFL) deals with domestic violence are contrasting the two punishments. They say it's time for the league to crack down on players who hurt women.\n\nMany people are upset over Rice's not-so-harsh punishment. Three members of Congress wrote NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking him to reconsider the penalty. The governor of Maine says he'll stop attending league games in protest. Numerous groups opposed to violence against women have condemned the punishment as far too light.\n\nLeague officials may soon act on the matter. The league is also looking into increasing future punishments for players involved in domestic violence.\n\n## \"Slap On The Wrist\"\n\n\"The first time with marijuana is different from the first time you are knocking your wife unconscious,\" said anti-domestic violence activist Judy Harris Kluger. \"What they did was such a small sort of slap on the wrist.\"\n\nThe league, she said, \"should have suspended\" Rice \"for a season at least.\" A stronger punishment would have sent \"a message that this is not tolerated, that this matters.\"\n\nRice's suspension begins Saturday. His punishment was handed down after grainy video footage surfaced, showing him dragging his unconscious girlfriend off of a casino elevator. Rice is believed to have beaten the woman - to whom he was then engaged - so badly that she passed out. Rice has not commented on what happened except to call his actions \"totally inexcusable.\"\n\nRice's assault charges could be removed from his record once he completes a diversion program - a form of sentencing that allows him to avoid criminal charges. So the only punishment he likely faces is what the NFL gave him - a suspension and a fine of around $500,000. For most people, that would be a lot of money. But for a professional football player, it's not so much.\n\nStill, Rice argues that he will suffer. \"My daughter is 2 years old now,\" he said at training camp. \"Me having to explain that to her, what happened that night, that's something I have to live with the rest of my life.\"\n\n## Other Penalties Are Harsher\n\nMany people feel Rice got off easy compared to other players who have been disciplined. Like Rice, Washington safety Brandon Meriweather was handed a two-game suspension - but his punishment was for a hit during an exhibition game. Broncos kicker Matt Prater has been suspended four games for alcohol use. Gordon was suspended for two games last season. His possible one-year ban is for violating the drug policy at least a third time.\n\nThe NFL has guidelines that set out clear punishments for using unlawful and performance-enhancing drugs. Domestic violence, however, is covered under separate personal conduct rules. It has been left up to the commissioner to deal with individual cases as he sees fit.\n\nThe NFL's personal code of conduct makes it clear that domestic violence will not be tolerated, Kluger says. However, she says the league didn't follow that code in punishing Rice.\n\n\"It boggles the mind that they did not act in a way that ... sent a message that this is more serious,\" said Kluger.\n\nThis is not a new issue for the NFL. Since January 2000, 77 players have been involved in 85 domestic violence incidents, with six being cut by their teams. The NFL suspended six players for one game each, and Rice now is the second player to be suspended for two games.\n\nGoodell has defended the Rice suspension. The league, he said, can't just \"make up\" the punishment. He also said Rice took responsibility and had not been in trouble before.\n\n## NFL Will Be Closely Watched\n\nU.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin sent a letter to Goodell and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome. In it, they criticized Rice's punishment as far too light.\n\n\"The decision to suspend Mr. Rice for a mere two games sends\" an \"inescapable message,\" the letter said: \"The NFL does not take domestic\" violence with the \"seriousness\" it deserves.\n\nThe NFL has yet to punish Carolina Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Hardy, who is awaiting trial for attacking his ex-girlfriend.\n\nAccording to domestic violence expert Mark Wynn, what the NFL does next is being watched closely.\n\n\"I hope,\" Wynn said, the NFL comes out and says: \"'We want to be the national standard\" when it comes to \"violence against women.\"\n\nIf the NFL were to say strongly, \"we have no tolerance for violence against women,\" he said, it would be a historically important moment for professional sports. The message would be loud and clear: \"Enough is enough.\"'"

            "title": "Talent versus character in NFL debated after murder arrest",
            "text": "\tA onetime point of pride for the New England Patriots has suddenly turned against the NFL team.\n\nThe team has been known for getting the most out of some talented players with character flaws. Think of receiver Randy Moss and running back Corey Dillon who had legal troubles during their careers. But it has had to defend its hiring decisions after Aaron Hernandez was arrested on murder charges.\n\nSome teams thought the former Patriots tight end was too risky to draft when he came out of college.\n\nNew England took a chance, however, selecting the troubled University of Florida standout in the fourth round of the 2010 draft. That seemed like a bargain for a player many thought was as talented as those picked in the first round. For three seasons, the move paid off. Hernandez reached the Pro Bowl in 2011 and received a five-year contract extension worth as much as $40 million.\n\nHernandez has pleaded not guilty in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd and is being held without bail in a Massachusetts jail. The Patriots cut Hernandez from the team less than two hours after he was arrested on June 26. The team also let fans exchange their used Hernandez jerseys for those of any other Patriot.\n\n## Arrest Sparks Debate In NFL\n\nThe high-profile arrest of Hernandez and the flood of information about his troubled past has sparked a debate within the NFL: When is a risky pick too risky?\n\n\"The owners are talking to their general managers as soon as this happened, saying, 'Let's make sure this doesn't happen to us,'\" said former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson. He won two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys with some troubled players on his teams. But he thinks some players who can straighten up will not get the chance to now. \"... people are going to be afraid of getting into a situation like this.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees. Tony Dungy won a Super Bowl as coach of the Indianapolis Colts. He believes that clubs will continue to roll the dice on players with character flaws if the price is right.\n\n\"You're going to get enough people to overlook it,\" Dungy said. \"People will say, 'I may not want to risk drafting this guy in the first round and paying him so much that if it goes haywire I've lost out. But at some point, it's worth the risk.' That's the way it is.\"\n\nHe added, \"Talent is the overriding factor in the NFL. Has been for a long time.\"\n\n## College Players Evaluated\n\nThere were warning signs with Hernandez. He failed drug tests and had run-ins with the law in college. A scouting service said that he enjoyed \"living on the edge of acceptable behavior,\" according to a document obtained by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe evaluation was prepared by Human Resource Tactics in North Carolina. It said Hernandez scored a lowest possible 1 out of 10 in \"social maturity.\" He scored a perfect 10 in \"focus\" and nines in other areas. The test found that Hernandez \"may be prone to partying too much and doing questionable things that could be seen as a problem for him and his team.\"\n\nThat evaluation was similar to one the company prepared on Maurice Clarett. The trouble-prone running back from Ohio State was chosen by Denver in the third round of the 2005 draft. He never played in the NFL and was let go from the team in training camp a month after signing a four-year contract.\n\n\"He scored high in everything but a two in social maturity,\" former Broncos general manager Ted Sundquist recalled. \"That was his downfall in Denver, the ability to interact.\"\n\nClarett has changed for the better after spending 3-1/2 years in prison on robbery and gun charges, Sundquist said. He was assigned to monitor Clarett by former coach Mike Shanahan.\n\n\"I was the one who was counseling him all through training camp,\" Sundquist said. \"It's like (Clarett) was upset with us for drafting him.\"\n\n## More Background Checks Needed\n\nSundquist, the team's general manager from 2002 to 2008, said people wrongly think that the NFL provides teams with thorough background checks on prospects. At least that wasn't the case when he was in the league.\n\n\"You can contact the league for some things,\" he said. \"But for the most part they're not going to give you what people are wanting, which is a top-to-bottom full report on a guy's character, his police blotter, all that kind of stuff.\"\n\nHe said typically clubs do not hire private investigators but instead rely on their area scouts to obtain background information on prospects. Some of those scouts are young and inexperienced. Often, that information comes from the player's college, which might not tell you everything.\n\n\"Some of the schools will tell you what you need,\" Sundquist said, \"but you have to have a relationship in place to get that information. Otherwise, if it's a young scout that goes in there, they're going to protect their reputation and their head coach, and the fact that they recruited a knucklehead.\"'"

            "text": "\t### PRO: Is the NFL to blame for players' private lives?\n\nBALTIMORE - An angry group of media commentators and politicians have taken to the newspapers and TV airwaves attacking the National Football League. Its crime: not properly policing the private lives of two of its most visible players.\n\nNo one is excusing the behavior of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. Their behavior, and that of a handful of other NFL stars, has been outrageous.\n\nDomestic violence and child abuse are serious crimes. They go against our laws and our morals. People guilty of such crimes ought to receive stiff punishment. But this is America. They deserve a fair trial. In the likely event they are found guilty, they deserve punishments that fit their crimes.\n\nIn the meantime, let's get real. The NFL can urge its several thousand players to behave morally. However, it cannot watch them 24 hours a day without seriously violating their privacy and civil liberties. It's the same as if we asked companies like NBC News, IBM, General Motors or Exxon Mobil to invade their workers' private lives.\n\n## Open Season On NFL\n\nThese media types have appointed themselves as moral judges of our lives. They keep yelping for the resignation of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and tough punishment against his league's 32 football teams. Since the players being punished are all African-Americans, one can only wonder if there's a faint aroma of racism in the air.\n\nYet it was open season on professional football long before Rice and Peterson became the media's favorite targets.\n\nThe Washington Post, led by its passionate opinion writers, has waged a war to get Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change his team's nickname. Snyder, to his credit, has strongly defended his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nAttacks on the Redskins make little sense. Repeated polling shows a large majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name Washington Redskins. Many even take pride in the team's portrayal of its mascot as noble, determined and strong. The support for the nickname is even stronger among its fans and the general public.\n\nRarely a day goes by that the Post's writers fail to highlight a story promoting one or another feature of their drive to change the \"offensive\" name. The crusade is intense and one-sided.\n\n## A Rush To Judgment\n\nThe Post's Sally Jenkins even wrote that Congress should \"step in and regulate the business of these 32 billionaire plunderers.\" Calling the NFL team owners thieves is unfair.\n\nFifty senators - all of them Democrats - have written to the NFL commissioner. They want the Redskins name changed. Given Congress' poor job performance, Jenkins' suggestion ought to make everyone think twice.\n\nIronically, until the last few years, the Redskins enjoyed flattering support from the Post and other D.C. media. Sports writers and commentators dined out in the team's press box and were guests in the owner's sky box.\n\nEnough already! One suspects that the chatter coming from the liberal media and many in the Democratic Party is merely an attempt to distract the public from President Barack Obama's failures. He's fallen short in his policies internationally and at home.\n\nRushing to judge someone without a proper trial - especially by the media and politicians - is never appropriate. It's especially wrong when they seem to echo the Red Queen's declaration in \"Alice in Wonderland\": \"Sentence first, verdict afterward.\"\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Whitt Flora, an independent journalist, is the former chief congressional correspondent for Aviation and Space Technology Magazine and former Washington correspondent for the Columbus Dispatch.

It may be the oldest play in the playbook. Blaming the media for just reporting on all the trouble the National Football League is in is just an easy way to move attention away from its problems.\n\nThat they resorted to such tactics only highlights the trouble the NFL finds itself in. Casual viewers and perhaps even the next generation of fans may drift away from the sport.\n\nIn a perfect world, breaking news wouldn't necessarily come to us from TMZ, blog blasts and ranting commentators on cable. But the heyday of serious news ended long ago.\n\nWhatever the news source, there's no mistaking that Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice sucker-punched his fiancee in an elevator and dragged her body into the hotel corridor. There's no mistaking that the NFL has a serious problem when it comes to violence within its ranks. And no can deny there's a problem with the long-term health of its players.\n\n## Brain Injuries A Big Problem\n\nFor a light can go out in a fan's heart. Not that long ago boxing and horse racing ranked among the top sports in the land. They drew huge crowds until the public decided that they were too crooked and, especially in the case of boxing, too violent.\n\nFootball is a violent game. We all know that. But it can be easily forgotten with the bright graphics, loud theme music and freeze-framed action offered to us from so many camera angles.\n\nBrain-related injuries are the most common injury in today's pro game.\n\nThe career expectancy for the average NFL player is 3.5 years, according to its players union. Wide receivers last only 2.81 years on average and running backs fare even worse at 2.57 years.\n\nSure, some players are cut from teams because somebody better came along. Yet the numbers strongly suggest that more hobble to the exits due to career-threatening injury.\n\nFor many, retirement soon becomes a nightmare. A new study reveals that nearly 30 percent of former NFL players will end up developing brain disease like Alzheimer's or dementia.\n\n## Fans Falling Out Of Love?\n\nWhat does this medical evidence mean for youth leagues and high school teams?\n\nA recent poll by ESPN found that 57 percent of parents said that recent stories about the increase in concussions in football have made them less likely to allow their sons to play in youth leagues.\n\n\"Should you let your child play football?\" The Boston Globe asked earlier this year. President Barack Obama doesn't think so, and has said that if he had a son he wouldn't let him play professional football.\n\nPop Warner, the largest youth football organization, saw participation drop nearly 10 percent from 2010 to 2012, ESPN reported. Roughly 60 percent to 70 percent of all NFL players started in the Pop Warner program.\n\nCan a sport survive at such a high level when fewer and fewer kids are playing it? Will the next generation choose a sport that's seen as increasingly unhealthy to those who participate in it?\n\nToday's NFL has a lack of leadership, especially at the top, meaning current Commissioner Roger Goodell. The league is increasingly haunted by long-term health concerns. And fans are starting to fall out of love with the sport.\n\nCritics can blame the media all they want. Yet today's NFL has many more serious issues than the next news report about its state of disrepair.\n\n> ABOUT THE WRITER: Tim Wendel is the writer-in-residence at Johns Hopkins University and the author of 11 books, including \"Summer of '68\" and \"Castro's Curveball.\" Readers may write him at JHU, 1717 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20036.\\n> \\n> This essay is available to McClatchy-Tribune News Service subscribers.

            "text": "\tSOCHI, Russia - Imagine how you might feel if you were a New Yorker waking up on a Monday after a weekend where the Red Sox finished a four-game sweep of the Yankees on Saturday. And then imagine it got worse: a Super Bowl Sunday in which the Patriots demolished the Giants.\n\nThen you might begin to understand the anguish people in Norway feel after last weekend's cross-country skiing results at the Olympics.\n\nIn both the men's and women's relay events, Norway failed to win a single medal. This is a national sports disaster for the country where residents are said to be born with skis on their feet. It was only the second time Norway hasn't won a relay medal since 1964.\n\nWhat's worse, arch-rival Sweden won both races. The Swedes had such a big lead in Sunday's men's competition that Marcus Hellner, the Swedish anchor, had time to ease up and carry the Swedish flag down the homestretch.\n\n## \"The Worst That Can Happen\"\n\n\"To be beaten by the Swedes is the worst that can happen,\" Petter Northug, the Norwegian anchor, said after the race.\n\nFor Norway, the collapse has prompted fevered news coverage. There are rumors that the team's coaches, and ski technicians, could lose their jobs after the Sochi Games.\n\n\"This is, like, huge drama,\" said Ida N. Rasch, a journalist with NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster.\n\nHer co-worker, Morten Stenberg, added: \"The whole country is talking about the bad results this week.\"\n\nIn fact, Norway's problems began last Thursday and Friday, in the men's and women's individual distance competitions. Between those two races, the country won just a single medal.\n\nThat was far below what the Norwegians had been expecting. Their skiers hold the top four spots in the international women's rankings, and three of the top four spots among men.\n\nThe relay races are a matter of deep national pride.\n\nAt the Olympics, Norwegian fans love the individual medals won by stars like Northug and Marit Bjorgen. But a strong showing in the four-leg team events affirms Norway's place as a cross-country power.\n\n## Waxes And Wanes\n\nThe Swedish men's team has now won two Olympic relays in a row, which started with their victory at Vancouver, Canada, in 2010.\n\n\"You hear Norway talking about the relay 12 months a year,\" Canadian cross-country star Alex Harvey said in an interview. \"You hear Northug talking about how he'll beat Hellner every day.\"\n\nMuch of the blame around the country's collapse has centered on ski preparation. The athletes apply sticky and slippery waxes to the bases of the cross-country skis. This helps them push off from the snow and glide over it.\n\nAfter the loss in the women's race on Saturday, Norway's athletes and coaches pinned their failure on skis. They said they were slower than their competition's, which led to an all-out effort to fix the problem in time for the men's event.\n\nThe day of that race, the Canadian team counted 22 Norwegians who were out on the trails testing skis. That's compared to the seven testers on the Canadian team.\n\n\"That's just what we saw on the track. Maybe there were more in the wax cabin,\" said Sacha Bergeron, the Canadian ski technician who did the count. \"For sure, they were trying to find a solution.\"\n\nThe desperate measures didn't work. Norway's men again complained about slow skis after their race. The Norwegian television station TV 2 called it a \"sm\\xc3\\xb8reskandale\" - Norwegian for \"wax scandal.\"\n\nBut there are also questions about the Norwegians' fitness. Other countries' coaches, athletes, and fans suspect that Norway's skiers are simply failing to perform.\n\n\"I think they'll probably blame their skis,\" said Justin Wadsworth, the coach of the Canadian cross-country team. \"But their athletes are obviously not in top shape. I think they're just off their A-game.\"\n\n## Norwegian Denial, Swedish Sympathy\n\nVidar Lofshus, the chief of Norway's cross-country team, denied that.\n\n\"Right now, I have no explanation,\" he said in an interview following the men's relay, in which he pinned the country's poor performance on slow skis. \"It's just a horror right now.\"\n\nNorway's struggles may be painful at home. But officials at the International Ski Federation (FIS), which organizes the cross-country races, view the diversity on the Olympic podiums as a positive development.\n\nFrance, for example, won its first-ever relay medal on Sunday. It took bronze, at the expense of fourth-place Norway. The upset should help make the sport more popular there, according to Pierre Mignerey, FIS's race director for cross-country skiing.\n\n\"We all know when you have a medalist in your ski club, you have more kids who want to be skiing,\" he said. \"It's good for cross-country when it's not only gold medals for Norway.\"\n\nThe Swedish media has also enjoyed Norway's defeat, much in the way the Boston press would celebrate a Red Sox blowout of the rival Yankees.\n\nBut in Sochi, the Norwegian performances have been so bad that even the Swedish athletes are starting to feel sympathetic.\n\n\"After seeing them ski, you know they are much better than the results show,\" Teodor Peterson said in an interview. He's a Swede who won a silver medal in the cross-country sprint last week.\n\n\"You'd rather beat them by this much,\" he said, spreading his fingers a few inches apart, \"than by a lot.\"'"

            "text": "\tDariel Alvarez was in a small speedboat trying to illegally escape from his home country, Cuba, when the vessel ran out of fuel in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"The first thought was, 'Wow, I went through so much just to die on the edge,'\" Alvarez, 25, recalled recently speaking in Spanish. \"I was scared to come so far and fall short.\"\n\nTwo years later, the baseball player is one of the Baltimore Orioles' up-and-coming position prospects. Alvarez combines steady defense in the outfield with an electrifying presence at the plate.\n\nThere's a lot Alvarez refuses to discuss about defecting from Cuba, a tightly-ruled communist country that prohibits some of its citizens from traveling abroad without permission. Leaving from the city of Camaguey, Alvarez went to Mexico in 2012 to pursue his dream of playing in the major leagues. Ask him how much he paid to desert the island nation, or who was waiting for him in Mexico, and he replies: \"If I tell you, I'll lie.\"\n\n## In The Dead Of Night\n\nHowever, he will talk about the journey that led him to play the highest level of minor league baseball, Triple-A, for the Norfolk Tides. That journey now sees him under consideration for a September promotion to the Orioles in Major League Baseball.\n\nAfter leaving his house in the dead of night, Alvarez and eight others fought their way through thick forest to a remote beach, where they hid in the bushes, whispering prayers, as they awaited their transport.\n\nWhen it finally arrived, they still faced a two-day trip to an unknown destination. Along the way came an unexpected refueling stop in the perilous ocean swells. Getting spotted meant being forced to return to Cuba, followed by time in prison. Alvarez was willing to risk it, to help his family and pursue this dreams.\n\nHis boat radioed another boat for gasoline, and after stockpiling enough for the remainder of the journey, continued west. At about 1 a.m., Alvarez estimates, he set foot in his new country.\n\nAlvarez defected understanding that, if stopped in international water, he would be suspended from playing the sport he loves in Cuba. He left realizing he might never see his family again. Alvarez escaped from Cuba without saying goodbye to several friends.\n\nThe United States requires Cuban athletes to get a special permit, called an unblocking license, to work for an American company. Alvarez went more than year without playing baseball while he waited for his unblocking license. He couldn't go forward or backward.\n\n## All-Star Futures Game\n\nAlvarez said the Cuban government won't allow him back into the country until 2021.\n\n\"I wish the time would pass faster,\" he said. \"Right now, what I wish for the most is to be able to hug my mom.\"\n\nAlvarez considers other Cuban defectors his brothers. He has spoken to the Los Angeles Dodgers' Yasiel Puig, the Chicago White Sox's Jose Abreu and Dayan Viciedo, and Texas Rangers outfielder Leonys Martin, who all have lived variations of the same story.\n\n\"They're examples to follow,\" Alvarez said. \"They're Cuban, they came here, they triumphed. That's what we all want. Come here, succeed, and leave our names in this country representing Cuba.\"\n\nThis year, Alvarez has come closer to his goal of joining his friends in the major leagues.\n\nIn late June, the outfielder received an invitation to the All-Star Futures Game in Minneapolis. Many current All-Stars once played in the Futures Game.\n\nFour days after the Futures Game, the Orioles promoted Alvarez to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Triple-A is the last minor league level below the major leagues.\n\nAs Orioles director of player operations Brian Graham explains, Alvarez presents an intriguing blend of raw power added to speed and instincts. The Orioles could see evidence of his strength and bat control from earlier play in the minor leagues. Defensively, he covers a lot of ground in the outfield and uses his cannon of a right arm to slow down opposing baserunners.\n\n## \"To Have My Family By My Side\"\n\nOrioles manager Buck Showalter believes Triple-A pitchers will find holes in Alvarez's swing, and that some adjustments will be necessary. Showalter still has high hopes for Alvarez.\n\n\"We think he has the best arm of everyone in the organization,\" Showalter said. He thinks Alvarez could play in the major leagues.\n\nAlvarez's future was not always that bright. Along with his difficulty in getting the right to try out for teams, scouts didn't view Alvarez as a high-caliber prospect. He signed with the Orioles for $800,000 in 2013. That was a much smaller bonus than some of the other Cuban stars of Major League Baseball received.\n\nIt was still an improvement from baseball in Cuba, where Alvarez said he made just $12 a month.\n\n\"[The money] surprised me a little,\" he said about his deal with the Orioles, \"but not that much, because there have been others who have made more, and I support them. Honestly, I would have taken whatever they would have offered me, because I wanted to play baseball.\"\n\nAlvarez met his girlfriend, Patricia Canedo, in the U.S., and they're expecting a baby boy in September. Canedo, who Alvarez said immigrated from Cuba legally, is working toward obtaining American citizenship. Once that happens, the Cuban government might permit Alvarez's family to visit. Alvarez hopes to introduce his mother to her American-born grandson someday.\n\n\"The only thing left to make me the happiest man in the world is to have my family by my side,\" he said.'"

            "text": "\tRALEIGH, N.C. - These young people could be called nerds: they are into video games, comics, superheroes. They're not stuck in front of a screen, though. These nerds fly through the city like their favorite superheroes.\n\nThey bounce off walls, jump over fences, hop off roofs. They practice parkour, an activity that involves running through the city as quickly as possible, athletically avoiding obstacles. People who practice parkour are called \"traceurs.\"\n\n\"Parkour is essentially training yourself to move more efficiently from Point A to Point B effectively, safely and with speed,\" says 23-year-old Nick Faircloth of Raleigh, who discovered parkour when he was 16. \"It's about training hard to enjoy the freedom of play.\"\n\n## French Kids Spread The Sport\n\nNo one is sure exactly where parkour came from - its origins are murky. It seems to have started in Vietnam in the 1950s, as training for the French military. In the 1990s, a group of French teens brought parkour back, and adapted it for city life.\n\nSoon, the Paris suburbs were filled with young people bouncing around public plazas, moving around the city with grace and agility not typically seen on the streets.\n\nAt first, the sport stayed mainly local. Then, smartphone cameras and YouTube allowed the sport to go global. Now there is a worldwide community of traceurs.\n\nThe community tends to be young and geeky, traceurs say. \"It's the sport of nerds,\" says Don Sportsman, whose 10-year-old son Cheland loves parkour.\n\nCheland started attending parkour classes at Enso Movement in Raleigh when the gym opened in April. He goes to classes about twice a week, but \"he'd go every day if he could,\" his dad says.\n\nParkour isn't Cheland's only quirky hobby - he is also into ventriloquism. He first got interested in puppetry, then dummies, then started working on his ventriloquist skills.\n\n## Wide Range Of Students Scaling Stuff\n\nOn a recent Tuesday evening, parkour instructor Alan Tran led a class of 10- to 16-year-olds in a training session that lasted an hour and 15 minutes, beginning with 20 minutes of warm-up.\n\nTran guided the traceurs through and over plywood platforms, walls and other obstacles in the gym, stressing the importance of technique and safety.\n\n\"Let's work on nice and quiet jumps,\" he advised, reminding his pupils that landing flat-footed is loud and potentially painful.\n\nEnso Movement offers some instruction during the day, but most classes are in the evening, each with five to 13 students. Most are middle school to college age; one of the adult classes has a student who is in his late 30s or early 40s. In France, classes for older people are common.\n\n## Suddenly, He Was Hooked\n\nFaircloth, who is an owner of the Enso gym, said he was not an active person when he stumbled onto parkour.\n\n\"I was sedentary, didn't do a whole lot,\" he recalls.\n\nOne day he found himself in the woods behind a relative's house. He began to jump and climb through obstacles he found among the boulders and fallen trees.\n\nShortly after, he was surfing the Internet when he discovered French kids doing the same moves in an urban environment - the city. For him, the moves were as close to being a superhero as a mortal could come - he was hooked.\n\nFaircloth's discovery of parkour came at the same time the sport was beginning to spread in North Carolina. Strong parkour communities developed at North Carolina State University and at UNC-Charlotte. Soon there were two statewide parkour jams where traceurs could gather.\n\n## New Ways Around The City\n\nPracticing parkour in the gym is like daily practice for team sports: getting better so you can enjoy the activity more. For traceurs, it's usually the weekends when they are able to get out into the city, putting their new skills to use, running, jumping, hopping and bouncing through the city.\n\nFaircloth says it's no surprise that young people want to do parkour.\n\n\"Kids want to be active,\" he says. \"It's not that kids don't want to play, it's just that sometimes they don't have options. If you're not into team sports, your options are limited.\"\n\nParkour is how kids have been playing for thousands of years, he says, only now, they have training.\n\n## Parkour Primer\n\nThere is parkour, and there are other similar sports. The differences:\n\nParkour - As Faircloth notes, parkour is about moving efficiently from Point A to Point B in a safe and speedy manner. That means going over obstacles - fences, walls, benches - whenever safely possible.\n\nFreerunning - Described by Enso Movement as an \"expressive\" performance \"with roots in parkour and branches in gymnastics, martial arts, dance and more.\" It's similar to parkour, though the goal isn't necessarily to get from A to B in as straight a line as possible.\n\nTricking - Unlike parkour, tricking doesn't deal with obstacles. According to Faircloth, it is more about \"complex acrobatic moves, kicking, spins, turns,\" break-dancing and similar moves.'"

            "title": "Playing golf by the numbers",
            "text": "\tBETHESDA, Md. - For the modern champion golfer, statistical analysis - number crunching - is just as important as choosing the right club. Every move on the golf course is recorded, measured, and studied. The goal, of course, is to improve a player's game.\n\nMore numbers became available after ShotLink, a computer-based system for gathering and storing information on golf games, was conceived in 1999. Since then, volunteers equipped with lasers have been measuring shots, from booming drives to tap-in birdies. For a typical event, about 350 volunteers are needed.\n\nNow, some players have begun relying on a person in their inner circle to crunch those numbers - that is, to mine them for patterns and useful information. Among such players are Jason Day, Zach Johnson and Brandt Snedeker\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean the players listen to what the numbers say and adjust their practice routines accordingly.\n\n## Details And Distances Of The Shots\n\n\"Some people don't like to know what their weaknesses are,\" said Colin Swatton, Day's coach and caddie.\n\nSwatton has been analyzing Day's stats since 2007. He doesn't rely on ShotLink because as hardworking as the volunteers are, he said they're not always accurate. So Swatton himself notes the details and distances of all Day's shots.\n\n\"Every round we analyze it,\" Swatton said, \"and then we break it down per hole, per course.\"\n\nDay said before every tournament, Swatton hands him a piece of paper that tells him what he has to do to win the event. It summarizes what the winner has done over the years - how many eagles, birdies, bogeys and double bogeys he had, along with averages on the par-3s, par-4s and par-5s.\n\n\"Sometimes it can be information overload,\" Day said - but it's still worth it to him.\n\n\"I need to stay ahead of the curve, make sure that I've got that extra step over the next person,\" he said. \"Whatever I can do to help me win, that's legal, obviously, I'll do.\"\n\n## Using The Wrong Club\n\nSnedeker has been using statistics for five years and believes that's why he had his top two years in 2012 and 2013. He ran up four victories and 16 top-10s over those two years.\n\nSnedeker gave a dramatic example of how the analysis helped him.\n\nPreviously, he wasn't getting at all close to the hole when shooting from 125 to 150 yards, Snedeker said. After studying the analysis of his performance, he realized he had been selecting a less-than-ideal club. \"Little stuff like that you can catch if you're paying attention to it.\"\n\nTim Clark also credits statistics for a turnaround in his game.\n\n\"I looked at my stats a few weeks ago to see where my game was sort of wrong, and I was about 180th or something on putts from 10 to 15 feet,\" he said. \"I knew I was struggling, but it was interesting to suddenly see it in writing.\"\n\nHe added, \"It was something I started to work on a little bit - I putted better at the John Deere, finishing fifth.\"\n\n## His \"Professor In Putting\"\n\nSweden's Peter Hanson is even more of a devotee than Clark and has \"a professor in putting\" to crunch his numbers. However, he primarily uses them to make his practice time more efficient.\n\n\"I spent way too many hours on things that didn't have as much of an effect on the game as I thought,\" Hanson said.\n\nHe believes number-crunching in golf is the wave of the future. It certainly helped him: It showed him he had been concentrating his practices on the wrong club - the wedge - when he should have been focusing on 6- and 7-irons.\n\n\"I spent hours and hours working on my wedge game,\" Hanson said. \"Then in the end you see between 30 and 80 yards you hit 3 and 4 percent of the shots. All those hours, you can spend those hitting 6- and 7-irons, which is really the key.\"\n\nDay said that at the end of the year, he sits down for a meeting with Swatton and the other members of his team. Swatton lays out what Day needs to improve on in the next 12 months. He also presents Day with a practice plan to \"maintain the strengths and improve the weaknesses.\"\n\nJohnson does the same thing in what he calls a \"team summit.\"\n\n\"Those magnify and pinpoint aspects that we can really attack in my game,\" he said.\n\n## Too Many Numbers?\n\nJustin Rose recently won the Quicken Loans National and Scottish Open back to back. He doesn't focus as deeply on statistics as Day and Johnson.\n\n\"The ShotLink stuff is so in-depth now,\" Rose said. It shows \"my putting from 6 feet, 7 feet, 8 feet, 9 feet, 10 feet. I might be 30th from 6 and 7 feet, and 180th from 8 feet and 60th from 10 feet. You can't really then go out and practice 8-footers because that's what you're 180th at. How you interpret stats I think is very, very important - but I don't get that in-depth and detailed on it.\"\n\nStill, Swatton is convinced that more and more golfers will recognize the value of statistical analysis.\n\n\"I think people will get more into it,\" Swatton said.'"

            "text": "\tBALTIMORE - After a video surfaced of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice striking his then fiance, Rice was let go by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday and suspended indefinitely by the NFL.\n\nThe grainy video was recorded in February and released by TMZ Sports on Monday. It apparently shows Rice and Janay Palmer in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino. They both hit each other before Rice knocked Palmer off her feet and into a handrail in the elevator.\n\nAn earlier TMZ video had showed Rice dragging Palmer, now his wife, from the elevator at the casino.\n\nThe Ravens said earlier Monday that they never saw the new video. Hours later, they sent out a one-sentence release: \"The Baltimore Ravens terminated the contract of RB Ray Rice this afternoon.\"\n\n## NFL Saw Video On Monday\n\nThe NFL also took action, saying on Twitter that Commissioner \"Roger Goodell has announced that based on new video evidence that became available today he has indefinitely suspended Ray Rice.\" Goodell is in charge of the NFL and was responsible for deciding Rice's punishment in the league.\n\nRavens coach John Harbaugh was expected to talk Monday night after practice about Rice being cut from the team.\n\nIn July, the NFL had suspended Rice for two games for domestic violence. That punishment had received widespread criticism in different circles. Some had said the penalty was not harsh enough.\n\n\"We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including the video from inside the elevator,\" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday morning. \"That video was not made available to us and no one in our office has seen it until today.\"\n\nGoodell said something similar on Aug. 1 during the Pro Football Hall of Fame induction weekend.\n\n\"When we're going through the process of evaluating the issue and whether there will be discipline, you look at all of the facts that you have available to us,\" Goodell said. \"Law enforcement normally has more ... information, facts, than we have. We'll get as much as we possibly can.\"\n\nRice's lawyer, Michael Diamondstein, was contacted by Associated Press reporters but would not comment on the matter.\n\n## Rice Was Serving 2-Game Suspension\n\nThe 27-year-old Rice was charged with felony aggravated assault in the case. But in May he was accepted into a pretrial intervention program that allowed him to avoid jail time. It also could have led to the charge being erased from his record.\n\nAfter Goodell drew criticism for not being tough enough on Rice, in a letter to all 32 NFL owners in August he wrote, \"My disciplinary decision led the public to question our sincerity, our commitment, and whether we understood the toll that domestic violence inflicts on so many families. I take responsibility both for the decision and for ensuring that our actions in the future properly reflect our values.\"\n\nHe added, \"I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will.\"\n\nFirst-time offenders now face a six-game suspension for domestic violence.\n\nRice began his suspension Sunday, when the Ravens opened their season with a 23-16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. He was scheduled to return after Thursday night's game against Pittsburgh Steelers. According to the terms of his suspension, Rice could not be with the team and must work out alone.\n\nRice hasn't spoken often to the media since his arrest. But on July 31, he called his actions \"inexcusable\" and said this was \"something I have to live with the rest of my life.\"\n\nHe added, \"I know that's not who I am as a man. That's not who my mom raised me to be. If anybody knows me, they know I was raised by a single parent, and that was my mother. I let her down, I let my wife down, I let my daughter down. I let my wife's parents down. I let the whole Baltimore community down. I let my teammates down. I let so many people down because of 30 seconds of my life that I know I can't take back.\"'"

            "title": "Trademark Board tries again to force Redskins name change",
            "text": "\tWASHINGTON - A federal trademark board ruled Wednesday that the Washington Redskins nickname is insulting to [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American). The trademark board decides whether a company has the right to protect its name and logos.\n\nThe ruling on the Redskins said that the team's trademark protections should be cancelled. Right now, those protections give the team the legal right to be the only company selling products that use the Redskins name. The board's decision puts new pressure on the team to change its name.\n\nThe ruling, which was voted 2-1 by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, came in a case that has been working its way through legal channels for more than 20 years. It doesn't force the team to abandon the name. However, it comes at a time of increasing criticism of team owner Dan Snyder. Political, religious and sports figures have all said it's time for the name to be changed.\n\nThe Redskins quickly announced that they will appeal, and the ending of trademark protections will be on hold while the matter makes its way through the courts. That process could take years.\n\n## Pressure Has Been Applied Before\n\nIt was the second time the board had issued an opinion on the case. In 2003, a similar ruling from 1999 was overturned on a technicality.\n\n\"We've seen this story before,\" Redskins lawyer Bob Raskopf said. \"And just like last time, today's ruling will have no effect at all on the team's ownership of and right to use the Redskins name and logo. We are confident we will prevail once again.\"\n\nIf the ruling stands, the team would still be able to use the name. However, it would lose much of its ability to protect its ownership of the name. If others printed the name on sweatshirts or hats without permission, it would become more difficult to go after them.\n\nCourts overturned the board's previous ruling in part because those challenging the name waited until too long after the team won the right to use it. The case was relaunched in 2006 by a younger group of Native Americans. Having recently become adults, they would not have been able to file a case earlier and so were entitled to file one now. The hearing was held in March of last year.\n\nThe chorus of critics against the use of the name has grown over the past year.\n\n## Lining Up To Support Change\n\nOn Saturday, the United Church of Christ urged its members to not attend Redskins games or buy Redskins merchandise. Half of the U.S. Senate recently wrote letters to the NFL urging a change. One letter declared that \"racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray added his voice to the growing list of critics. The Redskins name will almost certainly have to change, he said, if the team ever wants to build a new stadium in the city.\n\nSnyder, who has vowed repeatedly never to change the name, declined to comment. Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a possible conflict because they are employed by the team.\n\n\"Our job as players is to focus on what we can on this field day-in and day-out and let the legal people take care of that stuff,\" quarterback Robert Griffin III said. \"And when it's the right time, then we can voice whatever it is we know about the situation.\"\n\nThe Redskins have responded to critics by creating the Original Americans Foundation, which has been giving money to Native American tribes. Suzan Shown Harjo, a lead figure in the trademark case, said the foundation was simply trying to buy public support. She likened what it was doing to bribery.\n\nSupporters of a name change quickly hailed the decision.\n\n\"It is just a matter of time,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, until Snyder \"is forced to do the right thing.\"'"

            "title": "Referees get less respect, so youth sports run short of officials",
            "text": "\tFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. - Jimmy Woods has been a youth official for nearly 30 years. He's lost count of how many football games he has refereed and how many times he's been yelled at, threatened or insulted.\n\nOh, he remembers the details. He has been surrounded by angry parents following games. He has been called a cheater by coaches and cursed at as recently as this season by players and fans at a private high school in Little Rock.\n\nPeople do not respect officials anymore, said Woods, a 50-year-old firefighter who officiates games on the side. \"They think you're out to get them or cheat them.\"\n\nViolence against referees is as old as sport itself. Most people are familiar with awful stories from soccer matches in Europe or South America. However, the headlines have appeared uncomfortably closer to home for Woods and his fellow officials lately.\n\n## Angry Players Attack Referees\n\nOver two years' time, referees in Utah and Michigan died after they were punched by angry players during games. In September, two San Antonio football players smacked into a referee on purpose. The incident drew widespread condemnation.\n\nThis has come at a cost. By all accounts from those involved, finding and keeping referees is becoming more and more difficult. In fact, recognizing the possible shortage, many desperate state high school associations have taken lead roles in recruiting new talent to an aging group of referees who are facing shockingly hostile conditions.\n\nOne of those states is Kansas, where the number of registered officials has dropped since the 2012-13 school year.\n\nThe effects of a referee shortage are many, said Gary Musselman, executive director of the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Games are delayed or moved or canceled altogether. Referee crews in sports such as soccer and basketball are trimmed from three to two.\n\n## Older People May Handle Hostility Better\n\nYounger people may be less likely to want to be officials, Musselman said. Older people may be \"more established and aren't as caught up in, 'Does everybody like me?' Because officials are going to do things that people aren't going to like, and not everybody can handle that negative feedback.\"\n\nTwo years ago, the association started making it easier for people to train to be officials and offering a $1,000 grant. Coaches were asked to identify possible future referees among their players, too. The efforts resulted in 22 recent high school graduates registering to be officials.\n\nThe Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association offers to waive its first- or second-year registration fees for current and former members of the U.S. military. One marketing brochure reads: \"From Serving Our Country ... To Helping Our Schools.\"\n\nBarry Mano founded the National Association of Sports Officials (NASO) in 1980 and spent 23 years as a college basketball referee. The group doesn't keep national numbers to track the decline, but its 2002 survey found that 90 percent of high school officials believed they had a referee shortage. He also said fans have become more angry at officials.\n\n## Pay May Not Outweigh Risks\n\n\"Unsporting behavior continues to be the main reason that people get out of officiating,\" said Mano. He noted that pay for his members ranges from roughly $50 to $60 per game at the high school level to approximately $2,500 to $3,000 for major college football games. \"They worry about their safety, they worry about putting up with all that guff for $50 a game. Are you kidding me?\"\n\nA phone call to NASO leads to a menu with several choices. The third option is the association's Assault Protection Program for its 22,000-plus members.\n\nIt is a \"sad\" statement, Mano said. His organization has backed the creation of laws in more than 20 states to make punishments more harsh for people who attack a referee. NASO also provides insurance that can help officials who are the victim of an assault by a spectator or athlete. It also offers money for attorney fees.\n\n## \"The Problem Is Finding Good Refs\"\n\nDon Boss is 64 years old. He has officiated a variety of sports over his 47 years in the business. He has overseen high school and adult soccer leagues in Arkansas for more than 20 years. He assigns officials in the central part of the state and tries to weed out officials who might not be able to walk away from a heated situation.\n\n\"The problem isn't finding refs,\" Boss said. \"The problem is finding good refs.\"\n\nLike many officials, Woods started as a football referee to remain connected to the game he once played. It's a little money on the side, a chance to be active and around the game he loves.\n\nNearly 30 years later, the former minor league baseball player continues to referee despite taking medical leave from his firefighting job in recent years as he battles cancer. He plans to keep going.  \n\n\"It's a great service to the kids,\" Woods said. \"Without these guys working at all levels of football, from pee wee to junior high to high school to college to different pro and semi-pro events, these kids wouldn't be able to play.\"'"
